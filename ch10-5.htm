<H1>When is a Vehicle Man-Rated?</H1>As soon as they had recovered from their 
jubilant celebration after the MA-2 flight, the men responsible for Project 
Mercury at NASA Headquarters and in the Space Task Group looked east and west to 
see where they stood in the race to [323] put the first man into space. The 
Soviets had announced, on February 4 and February 12, two more unsuccessful 
attempts, with heavy <I>Sputniks IV</I> and <I>V</I>, to launch interplanetary 
space probes to Venus. These were impressive attempts by instrumented vehicles 
to achieve scientific firsts, but they apparently had no direct relationship to 
any immediate manned space flight. It had been three months since the failure of 
<I>Sputnik Cosmic Ship No. 3</I> on December 2, 1960. At the end of February 
1961, the Soviets' open record of two failures out of three attempts with their 
prototype manned spacecraft made it appear that they were having as many 
technical difficulties as the Americans were.
<P>During the last week in February, therefore, the international space race 
seemed to have cooled. At home the reliability of the Redstone was very much at 
issue. It was at this juncture that the von Braun and Debus Mercury-Redstone 
teams presented to NASA Headquarters the results of three intensive reliability 
studies that they had made at Marshall since the overacceleration of MR-2 had 
given Ham such a rough ride. The first of these three separate probability 
studies was based on 69 Redstone and Jupiter flight histories; the second was 
based on a mathematical model using a reconstruction of the flight record of all 
components and subsystems of the Mercury-Redstone; and the third was a still 
more refined reliability study using adjusted values of the human factor and 
system design improvements. Together these studies yielded confidence figures 
that "led MSFC to opinion that the Mercury-Redstone launch vehicle reliability 
was in the range of 88 percent to 98 percent probability for launch success and 
crew survival, respectively."<A

While President Kennedy, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, and Administrator 
Webb were learning their executive empires and were instituting a thorough 
review of the Nation's space program, Dryden, Seamans, Silverstein, and Gilruth 
accepted von Braun's insistence to postpone the first manned flight and to 
insert an extra Redstone booster test into the Mercury flight schedule.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
<P>Whereas the Space Task Group had been elated with the performance of Ham in 
spite of difficulties with the capsule and the booster on the MR-2 flight the 
last day in January, the von Braun team at Marshall and the Cape had undergone 
an anguished period of reappraisal during the first two weeks in February as 
they tried once again to explain the "chatter" in the guidance system of their 
Redstone rocket. On February 6, Debus recorded in his daily journal his position 
with respect to the readiness status of the booster to be used for the first 
manned flight: "At least one unmanned shot must be obtained with flawless 
performance of the Mercury-Redstone mission booster flight, or at least no major 
shortcoming must be discovered in the vehicle system." Eberhard F. M. Rees, von 
Braun's Deputy Director for Research and Development, concurred and so informed 
von Braun. The next day Kuettner drew up an elaborate memo for internal use in 
deciding what should be Marshall's technical recommendation on whether to man 
the next Mercury-Redstone flight. In a covering note, [324] Kuettner explained 
the situation to von Braun,<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source58"><SUP>58</SUP></A> 
and concluded that he personally would not advise calling a halt yet.
<P>On Monday, February 13, 1961, Gilruth, Williams, Faget, Jerome B. Hammack, G. 
Merritt Preston, and Kenneth S. Kleinknecht of STG, along with John F. Yardley 
and R. L. Foster of McDonnell, met with the von Braun group at Huntsville to 
decide on "man or no man" for MR-3. By that date Debus had provided Kuettner 
with a list of 10 weak links, both in the hardware and in procedure, that needed 
correction before MR-3. The Marshall engineers incorporated their numerical 
guesswork into a "priority list of weak spots" that itemized seven major 
component problems, five minor component discrepancies, and six procedural 
difficulties still under study in mid-February.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
<P>As Kuettner expected, political and medical considerations in the final 
decision to launch the first manned flight elevated the final choice to NASA 
Headquarters in Washington. Gilruth, his Redstone project engineer, Hammack, and 
the rest of STG were satisfied with the "quick fixes" made by Marshall and 
ground tested after MR-2. Certainly the seven astronauts felt impatiently ready 
to go. But von Braun and Debus reminded the Task Group of its own original 
ground rule for reliability: no manned flight would be undertaken until all 
parties responsible felt perfectly assured that everything was in readiness. 
Marshall engineers doubted that the difficulties encountered on the MR-1A and 
MR-2 missions would have endangered a human passenger. But they were committed 
to scrupulousness in their reliability program, too, and during the last week in 
February there were still seven significant modifications to the Redstone 
booster that seemed to require another unmanned flight test. So during this last 
week in February, Robert Seamans, Abe Silverstein, and Robert Gilruth acquiesced 
in the demands of Marshall Space Flight Center to insert one more Redstone 
flight into the Mercury schedule. The fateful decision was made to postpone 
MR-3, the first manned flight, until April 25 so something then called "MR-2A" 
could be inserted for a launch on March 28. On March 3 there seemed little 
question of the technical wisdom of this decision, although there was extreme 
sensitivity about the time set for the launch and about its possible public 
consequences.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
<P>Marshall undertook to correct everything and asked STG only to provide the 
payload for the additional mission. Neither the Task Group nor McDonnell had an 
extra production capsule, so the boilerplate model that had been used on Little 
Joe-1B in January 1960 was refurbished and sent to Huntsville for the first 
mating with Redstone booster No. 5. Instead of the normal designation for the 
second try at an unfulfilled mission, MR-2A was renamed "MR-BD" 
(Mercury-Redstone Booster Development). Gilruth and company made no plans either 
to separate the capsule from the launch vehicle or to recover the remains. MR-BD 
was left primarily to von Braun and Debus, while STG turned most of its 
attention to Little Joe 5A. Only the operations team from STG would participate 
in manning the Control Center. As Marshall and the Cape made ready this flight 
[325] with the booster that had formerly been designated for the third manned 
suborbital training flight (MR-5), they were unaware that the Soviet Union was 
making ready another series of heavy Sputniks.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
<P>On March 9, 1961, the U.S.S.R. announced it had launched into orbit its 
fourth cosmic ship, or <I>Korabl Sputnik IV</I>, weighing some 4,700 kilograms 
(10,364 pounds) and containing a dog passenger named Chernushka. When the dog 
was recovered, later that day, the Soviet recovery record suddenly became two 
out of four tries, and NASA saw the possible consequence of its MR-BD decision. 
Outside of NASA, the implications were by no means clear. The newspaper space 
race continued unabated.
<P>In a highly publicized letter, Representative Overton Brooks wrote to 
President Kennedy on March 9, 1961, of his concern over military and trade 
journal reports that the space program might veer toward military control. 
Brooks thought the Wiesner report had implied this, and he knew of a special 
PSAC investigating committee of scientists, called the "Hornig panel" after its 
chairman, Donald F. Hornig. This group, charged with an overall review of the 
manned space program, had just finished spending the first four days of March 
traveling around investigating Project Mercury. Brooks reminded the new 
President that the intent of the Space Act of 1958 was to ensure that control of 
space research remain in civilian hands so that resulting information and 
technological applications would be open for the benefit of all enterprise, both 
private and public. Too much information would become classified, he said, if 
the military were preeminent in space research, development, and exploration. 
Brooks asked for and received Kennedy's reassurance that neither he nor Wiesner 
had considered subordinating NASA to the military.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
<P>With Kennedy's affirmation of NASA's leadership role and its 10-year plan for 
space research, development, and exploration, Administrator Webb concentrated on 
the scientific criticisms and budgetary deficiencies of the agency. Program 
priorities and the funds necessary for them were taken up first. Webb found that 
most of his staff and field scientists were enthusiastic about getting on with 
advanced manned space exploration beyond Mercury. They wanted large booster 
development and manned spacecraft and space flight development leading to 
exploration of the Moon. Webb also learned that the scientific community outside 
of NASA was not so disenchanted with manned space flight as some had supposed. 
Lloyd V. Berkner, a geophysicist and chairman of the Space Science Board of the 
National Academy of Sciences, championed the cause of NASA programs. Berkner and 
Hugh Odishaw had just edited an anthology, <I>Science in Space</I>, attempting 
to garner the support of many disciplines for an expanded space program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
<P>On March 13 and 14, Administrator Webb and his chief lieutenants began a new 
series of annual presentations to Congress justifying their financial requests 
for the coming fiscal year 1962. Abe Silverstein, spurred several times by [326] 
Chairman Brooks of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, departed 
from his prepared text on the progress of Mercury to explain the MR-BD decision 
in connection with the imminent first manned mission into space: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>I don't know whether you heard our briefing here several weeks ago 
  in which we pointed out that this Redstone booster traveled 400 miles out when 
  it should have gone 293, and went to an altitude of about 150 miles, when it 
  should have gone to 110. These were due to some booster malfunctions. We have 
  tracked these down and we intend to go ahead and make changes in the booster 
  so that we have better control of it. We are not about to operate with a 
  booster that is as sloppy in performance as that.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source64"><SUP>64</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Several 
days later in a speech before the American Astronautical Society, Administrator 
Webb publicly stated that NASA's program should be expanded to include more 
scientific space exploration.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source65"><SUP>65</SUP></A> 
The effort of NASA management to get White House approval at this time for 
post-Mercury manned flight and basic funding for booster development was to 
prove of historical importance.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source66"><SUP>66</SUP></A> 
On March 22, President Kennedy called Webb, Dryden, and Seamans to meet with 
himself, the Vice-President, and key White House staff to review the need for 
supplementing the NASA fiscal 1962 budget. As a result a $125.76 million 
increase was approved for NASA.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-5.htm#source67"><SUP>67</SUP></A> 
In the mind of the general public, unaware of these deliberations on an 
accelerated space program, NASA was thoroughly identified with Project Mercury 
and attention was pointing toward the first manned mission in the near future.<A

premature effort to "put a man in space in order to gain some prestige and have 
the man take a disproportionate risk." On February 28, Webb announced the
