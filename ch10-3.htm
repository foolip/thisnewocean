<H1>MR-2: Ham Paves the Way</H1>[310] By the end of January 1961, the technical 
outlook for Project Mercury was much improved. The end of the qualification 
flight tests was in sight, if only the Little Joe, Redstone, and Atlas boosters 
would cooperate. First priority was to make sure the Mercury-Redstone 
combination was prepared for the first manned suborbital flights. Now, according 
to the progressive buildup plan, the reliability of the system required 
demonstration by the second Mercury-Redstone (MR-2) flight, with a chimpanzee 
aboard, as a final check to man-rate the capsule and launch vehicle.
<P>Preparations for the MR-2 mission had begun long before the actual flight. 
Between manufacturing the capsule and flight readiness certification, several 
months of testing and reworking were necessary at the McDonnell plant, at 
Marshall Space Flight Center, and at Cape Canaveral. Capsule No. 5, designated 
for the MR-2 flight, had been near the end of its manufacturing phase in May 
1960. When it was completed, inspectors from the Navy Bureau of Weapons 
stationed at St. Louis, in cooperation with STG's liaison personnel at 
McDonnell, watched it go through a specified series of tests, and the contractor 
corrected all detected deficiencies.<A

After capsule systems tests and factory acceptance tests, capsule No. 5 was 
loaded into an Air Force cargo plane and shipped to Marshall Space Flight Center 
on September 3, 1960. At Huntsville, Wernher von Braun's team hurried through 
its checkouts of the compatibility of capsule No. 5 with Redstone booster No. 2, 
and had finished well before its 16-day time limit.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source24"><SUP>24</A></SUP> 
On October 11, 1960, the capsule arrived by air at the Cape, where the first 
checkout inspections, under the direction of F. M. Crichton, uncovered more 
discrepancies, raising to 150 the total of minor rework jobs to be done. Because 
of the complexities of the stacked and interlaced seven miles of wiring and 
plumbing systems in the Mercury capsule, however, each minor discrepancy became 
a major cost in the time necessary for its correction. Checkout work in Hangar S 
required 50 days for systems tests and 60 days for rework. The capsule 
designated for the first manned space flight, No. 7, also had arrived at the 
Cape for preflight checkouts, but the launch vehicle for MR-2 was delivered to 
the Cape by air freight on December 20, 1960, the day after MR-1A was launched. 
It too had undergone exhaustive reliability testing in the shops and on the 
stands in the hills west of Huntsville, Alabama. When Joachim P. Kuettner, 
representing von Braun, transferred the MR-2 booster to Emil P. Bertram, 
representing Kurt H. Debus' Launch Operations Directorate, their confidence in 
this particular booster of the "Old Reliable" series was high but not 
towering.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source25"><SUP>25</A></SUP>
<P>Using the "quick-look" evidence from the MR-1A flight, Marshall guidance 
engineers set about correcting the conditions that had made the trajectory too 
steep and accelerations too high. MR-1A had climbed to its programmed apogee of 
about 130 miles and landed 235 miles downrange, and high altitude [311] winds 
had carried it too close to the range borders. Range safety restrictions 
dictated that a launch vehicle must get out and away from the Cape as soon as 
possible. For these reasons, Walter C. Williams, STG's Associate Director for 
Operations, agreed with H. F. Gruene and Kuettner that the MR-2 trajectory 
should be flattened. An apogee of 115 miles on a downrange distance of 290 miles 
should be well within the allowable safety limits. Gruene and others calculated 
that this trajectory would still provide almost five minutes of weightless 
flight and a reentry deceleration of 10 g. Since this g load was slightly less 
than that desired by STG, Williams had to use his best persuasion during a 
series of consultations on the reentry loads to get Marshall to match the 12-g 
median reentry load by moving the engine cutoff time ahead to assure such 
conditions. At the same time, the range safety officer felt that the designated 
105-degree launching azimuth was uncomfortably close to the shoreline. Williams, 
Charles W. Mathews, and Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., held out against a requested 
change to a 100-degree azimuth, because they wanted to minimize pilot retrieval 
time in case of an abort. To this STG later acceded, in exchange for its point 
on the 12-g reentry load; Marshall added a timer switch that would cut off the 
ignition if the accelerometer cutoff signal should fail before fuel depletion.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source26"><SUP>26</A></SUP>
<P>Capsule No. 5 contained several significant innovations. There were five new 
systems or components that had not been qualified in previous flights: the 
environmental control system, the attitude stabilization control system, the 
live retrorockets, the voice communications system, and the "closed loop" abort 
sensing system. Capsule No. 5 also was the first in the flight series to be 
fitted with a pneumatic landing bag. This plasticized fabric, accordion-like 
device was attached to the heatshield and the lower pressure bulkhead; after 
reentry and before landing the heatshield and porous bag were to drop down about 
four feet, filling with air to help cushion the impact. Once in the water, the 
bag and heatshield should act as a sort of sea anchor, helping the spacecraft to 
remain upright in the water. Chronic problems with wave-induced fatigue of the 
fabric bag led STG and McDonnell engineers to concentrate on the harness 
linkages inside. After the Big Joe ablation flight test in September 1959, STG 
had decided to use on the Redstone flights, simply because they were on hand, 
the expensive beryllium heatshields that had first been ordered for orbital 
reentry. Since the anticipated reentry temperature would reach only 1000 degrees 
F, the beryllium shields were not necessary as heatsinks, but they served as 
readymade impact bumpers. Temperatures on the conical portion of the spacecraft 
might approach 250 to 300 degrees F, but, compared with about 1,000 to 2,000 
degrees for an orbital mission, the ballistic flights should be cool.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source27"><SUP>27</A></SUP>
<P>Publicity once again focused on the biological subject in the MR-2 
experiment. The living being chosen to validate the environmental control system 
before committing a man to flight was a trained chimpanzee about 44 months old. 
Intelligent and normally docile, the chimpanzee is a primate of sufficient size 
and sapience to provide a reasonable facsimile of human behavior. [312] Its 
average response time to a given physical stimulus is .7 of a second, compared 
with man's average .5 second. Having the same organ placement and internal 
suspension as man, plus a long medical research background, the chimpanzee 
chosen to ride the Redstone and perform a lever-pulling chore throughout the 
mission should not only test out the life-support systems but prove that levers 
could be pulled during launch, weightlessness, and reentry.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source28"><SUP>28</A></SUP>
<P>A colony of six chimpanzees (four female and two male), accompanied by 20 
medical specialists and animal handlers from Holloman Air Force Base, where the 
"astrochimps" were stationed and trained, moved into quarters behind Hangar S on 
January 2, 1961. There the animals became acclimatized to the change from the 
5,000-feet altitude in New Mexico to their sea level surroundings at the Cape. 
Separated into two groups as a precaution against the spread of any contagion 
among the whole colony, the animals were led through exercises by their 
handlers. Mercury capsule mockups were installed in each of the compounds. In 
these, the animals worked daily at their psychomotor performance tasks. By the 
third week in January, 29 training sessions had made each of the six chimps a 
bored but well-fed expert at the job of lever-pulling. To condition the chimps 
to respond properly, they received banana pellets as rewards and mild electrical 
shocks as punishments.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source29"><SUP>29</A></SUP>
<P>Although recovery procedures had worked well until now, recovery operations 
for MR-2, carrying life into space from the Cape rather than from Wallops 
Island, demanded extra care and attention. So STG provided the Navy with the 
detailed requirements, and the Navy again assigned Rear Admiral F. V. H. Hilles 
to command the recovery forces. Under Hilles were several task elements. One, 
located on the beach near the launch pad, consisted of numerous amphibious 
vehicles and several helicopters. Should an abort occur near the pad, these 
vehicles on the scene would pick up the pieces. Offshore the next recovery 
perimeter was covered by a small naval vessel, the <I>Opportune</I> (Auxiliary 
Recovery Ship 41). The largest recovery unit, the one in the anticipated landing 
area, consisted of six destroyers and a landing ship dock (LSD) with three 
helicopters on board. If the capsule were shot beyond the expected impact area, 
an air recovery unit consisting of four P2V aircraft from Jacksonville, Florida, 
would go into action.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source30"><SUP>30</A></SUP>
<P>STG's man in charge of recovery operations was Robert F. Thompson, a Navy 
veteran who once had been first lieutenant of the deck crew aboard a destroyer 
and who by now had coordinated STG's recovery requirements for over two years. 
Through Walter Williams, Thompson asked the Navy to provide for the recovery 
personnel participating in the exercise and to take along photographers and 
public information people as well. Thompson assigned Donald C. Cheatham to brief 
the naval crews from Charleston, South Carolina, on postflight procedures for 
removing the biopack and primate from the spacecraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source31"><SUP>31</A></SUP>
<P>According to the "Master Operational Schedule," a guidebook prepared by [313] 
Debus' experienced staff, a simulated or dress rehearsal flight must always be 
conducted three days before launch. For this exercise, the countdown started 
only 180 minutes before "launch," when Complex 56, Pad 5, the site of all the 
Mercury-Redstone launches, switched on the power to all systems in the Redstone. 
The team training of the launch crew, even for the old Redstone, required 
thousands of coordinated actions and easy familiarity by each of the 70 or so 
members of the blockhouse crew, by each of the 100 men in the Mission Control 
Center, and by each of another 100 people around the launch site to get a flight 
off the ground. While the booster was ready for mate with the capsule as 
scheduled in mid-January, the capsule was not ready, and the simulated flight 
test was carried out on January 27 for a "mission" that lasted 455 minutes.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source32"><SUP>32</A></SUP>
<P>One of the procedural safeguards developed in the effort to man- rate the 
Redstone was the "split-count," with a built-in hold in the countdown checklist. 
The count began at 640 minutes before launch and stopped for a rest period 390 
minutes short of liftoff time (T). At 640 minutes the complex went on critical 
power and the prescribed systems checks were started, the communication network 
readiness was verified, range equipment was checked, and the launch vehicle 
telemetry was tuned. At T minus 390 minutes all systems were secured for the 
standby period so that the crew could relax. This "split-count" became a 
standard part of manned preflight operations.
<P>Before the second half of the count began, on the following day, the booster 
was again supplied its electrical power, the escape rocket igniter was installed 
but not connected, the liquid oxygen trailer truck was moved into position, 
weather forecast and range clearances were checked, and the booster guidance and 
control battery safety wires were installed. When the count was resumed at T 
minus 390, there were still at least 330 specific jobs to be performed or 
functions to be validated before liftoff.
<P>The launch plan for the MR-2 mission followed closely all of the foregoing 
preparations, with each event preplanned and budgeted on the schedule. Many new 
systems were being qualified and, with the chimpanzee aboard, the control 
systems had to operate in the automatic mode. The operations directive for MR-2 
specified that in case of an unduly long hold, the test would be canceled at 
high noon to avoid the risks of a recovery in darkness.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source33"><SUP>33</A></SUP>
<P>Telemetry was to be all-important for the MR-2 mission. For that purpose two 
transmitters were installed in the capsule, providing eight channels of 
information to ground stations. These included three aeromedical channels to 
transmit pulse, respiration rate, and breath-depth information. The other 
channels carried information on structural heating, cabin temperatures, 
pressures, noise, and vibrations from 90 different points throughout the 
spacecraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source34"><SUP>34</A></SUP>
<P>All six chimps in the colony were accorded equal treatment until the day 
before the flight, when James P. Henry of STG and John D. Mosely, the 
veterinarian from Holloman, had to choose the test subject and his substitute. 
First the animals were given a physical examination, and then they were each 
checked [314] on sensors, the psychomotor programmer, and consoles for 
comparative ratings. The competition was fierce, but one of the males was 
exceptionally frisky and in good humor. A female was selected as his alternate. 
At nineteen hours before launch these two animals were put on low-residue diets, 
fitted with biosensors, and checked out in their pressurized couch-cabins. Seven 
and one-half hours before the flight a second physical examination was given, 
followed by more sensor and psychomotor tests. About four hours before launch, 
the two chimps were suited up, placed in their couches, and brought aboard the 
transfer van, where their environmental control equipment was attached. The 
trailer truck arrived at the gantry alongside MR-2, and there, an hour and a 
half before the scheduled launch time, the chimpanzee named "Ham," in honor of 
Holloman Aerospace Medical Center, still active and spirited although encased in 
his biopack, boarded the elevator to meet his destiny.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source35"><SUP>35</A></SUP>
<P>At sunrise on January 31, 1961, feverish preparations were underway in the 
community around Launch Complex 56. Walter Williams was directing operations for 
the third time from the newly completed Mercury Control Center. Supporting him 
were some 500 men from NASA, the military services, and industrial contractors. 
Key supervisors included the recovery force commander, range commander, launch 
director, capsule test coordinator, flight director, Atlantic Missile Range 
coordinator, network status monitor, range safety observer, and director of 
medical operations.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source36"><SUP>36</A></SUP> 
About 5 o'clock systems checks were progressing well, and Tecwyn Roberts, flight 
dynamics officer, reported that the command checks were all working "A. OK."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source37"><SUP>37</A></SUP> 
Communications checks were the same, with the exception of the Goddard link from 
Mercury Control on the data selection loop, and trajectory checks and displays 
appeared to be in order. The broken link with Goddard, discovered well before 
the flight, was cleared and the data selection loop restored. Although the 
weather was threatening and five-foot waves were reported in the recovery area, 
the second half of the countdown began at 7:25 a.m. After the count had 
progressed 20 minutes, the first trouble of the morning appeared with a report 
that a tiny but important electronic inverter in the capsule automatic control 
system was overheating. Nevertheless, at 7:53 Ham was inserted into the 
spacecraft, and the clear-the-pad signal horn was sounded.
<P>A few minutes after Ham went aboard, the inverter temperature began to rise 
again, causing several more holds. As the wait wore on, Christopher Kraft, the 
flight director, sought advice about Ham's ability to endure a long hold. 
William S. Augerson, medical monitor in the blockhouse, assured Kraft that the 
animal was all right. Ham's suit temperature remained in the comfortable 
mid-60s, while the inverter temperature was at least three times that hot. 
Eventually the inverter cooled to 150 degrees F, and the count was resumed at 
10:45. As soon as the power was turned on again, the inverter temperature shot 
up again. So another cooling-off period was called until 20 minutes before noon, 
when it [315] was decided that now or never was the time to go today. The 
countdown had been delayed almost four hours because of the hot inverter, but 
there were some other minor problems as well. The gantry elevator got stuck; too 
many people took too long to clear the pad area; checking the environmental 
control system required 20 minutes longer than planned; and the booster 
tail-plug cover flaps were jammed for a while.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source38"><SUP>38</A></SUP>
<P>At last, five minutes before high noon on the last day of January 1961, MR-2 
ignition occurred and liftoff of the Redstone followed in less than a second. As 
the launch vehicle rose, a transistorized television camera mounted externally 
near the top of the Redstone scanned the surface of the capsule and adapter ring 
to provide engineers with bird's-eye data on the flight behavior of the 
spacecraft when it blasted away from the launch vehicle. Computers sensed one 
minute after launch that the flight path angle was at least one degree high and 
rising. At two minutes, the computers predicted a 17-g load. Then, 137 seconds 
into the flight, the liquid oxygen supply became depleted, and in another half 
second the engine shut down according to the new timer-programmed plan. The 
closed-loop abort system on the Redstone sensed the change in engine chamber 
pressure upon depletion of the lox supply and fired the capsule escape system 
earlier than planned, within another half second. The abort properly signalled 
the expected Mayday message to the recovery forces, and they sped off toward a 
computed impact point farther downrange.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source39"><SUP>39</A></SUP>
<P>The high flight angle, coupled with the early abort, added 52,000 pounds of 
thrust for one second, and yielded a maximum velocity of 7,540 feet per second, 
against a planned 6,465 feet. The retrorockets jettisoned prematurely when the 
tower aborted, which meant that the spacecraft on reentry would not be 
artificially slowed down and therefore would gain still more downrange 
mileage.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source40"><SUP>40</A></SUP>
<P>An unexpected and nearly ultimate test of the chimpanzee's air circuit arose 
just before the abort, 2 minutes and 18 seconds into the flight, when cabin 
pressure dropped from 5.5 to 1 pound per square inch. This malfunction was 
traced later to the air inlet snorkel valve, a device that was spring-loaded to 
the closed position and held in place by a small detent pin. Apparently 
vibrations had loosened this pin and allowed the valve to open, as it was 
intended to do only after the main parachute opened on descent toward a water 
landing. Ham did not suffer, for although cabin pressure was lost, his couch 
pressure remained nominal, and suit temperature stayed well within the 60- to 
80-degree optimum range. But the open valve caused problems after the capsule 
splashed.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source41"><SUP>41</A></SUP>
<P>Because of overacceleration of the launch vehicle plus the added energy of 
the escape rocket, a speed of 5,857 miles per hour was attained instead of the 
4,400 miles per hour planned, resulting in an apogee of 157 miles rather than 
the charted 115. At its zenith Ham's spacecraft was already 48 miles farther 
downrange than programmed, and Ham endured the weightless state for 1.7 minutes 
longer (6.6 minutes total) than the 4.9 minutes scheduled. He landed 422 miles 
[316] downrange after a 16.5-minute flight; the preplanned figures called for 
290 miles and 14.25 minutes. His peak reentry g was 14.7, almost 3 g greater 
than planned.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source42"><SUP>42</A></SUP>
<P>How did Ham fare through all this? The physician in the blockhouse, William 
Augerson, reported that at liftoff he was stable and working his levers 
perfectly to avoid the punishment that came from inattention. At waist level in 
the chimpanzee's couch was a dashboard with two lights and two levers that 
required two pounds of effort to depress. Ham knew well how to stay comfortable 
by avoiding a series of electrical shocks. Each operation of his right-hand 
lever, cued by a white warning light, postponed the next scheduled shock for 15 
seconds. At the same time, the animal had to push the left-hand lever within 
five seconds after a blue light flashed, about every two minutes, in order to 
avoid another series of shocks to the soles of his feet.
<P>Ham performed these tasks well, pushing the continuous avoidance (right) 
lever about 50 times and receiving only two shocks for bad timing. On the 
discrete avoidance (left) lever, his score was perfect. Reaction time on the 
blue-light lever averaged .82 second, compared with a preflight performance of 
.8 second. Ham had gone from a heavy acceleration g load on exit through six 
minutes of weightlessness and to another heavy g load on reentry hardly missing 
a trick. Onboard cameras filming Ham's reaction to weightlessness also recorded 
a surprising amount of dust and debris floating around inside the capsule during 
its zenith. The cleanliness problem still was not licked.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source43"><SUP>43</A></SUP>
<P>When Ham's capsule touched down, about 12:12 p.m., no human being was in 
sight. Some 12 minutes later, the first electronic recovery signal from the 
capsule was received, and quick triangulations showed that the capsule was about 
60 miles from the nearest recovery ship, the destroyer <I>Ellison</I>. Some 27 
minutes after landing, Technician G. T. Beldervack, aboard a P2V search plane, 
sighted the capsule floating upright alone in the Atlantic. Reckoning that the 
<I>Ellison</I> would require at least two hours to reach that point, STG 
officials decided to request the Navy to dispatch its helicopters from the next 
closest ship, the LSD <I>Donner</I>. When the helicopters arrived on the scene, 
they found the spacecraft on its side, taking on water, and submerging. Wave 
action after impact had apparently punished the capsule and its occupant 
severely. The beryllium heatshield upon impact had skipped on the water and 
bounced against the capsule bottom, punching two holes in the titanium pressure 
bulkhead. The plastic fabric in the landing bag had worn badly, and the 
heatshield was torn free from the spacecraft before recovery. After the craft 
capsized, the open cabin pressure relief valve let still more sea water enter 
the capsule. When the helicopter pilot, First Lieutenant John R. Hellriegel, and 
his copilot George F. Cox, finally latched onto and picked up Ham's spacecraft 
at 2:52 p.m., they estimated there was about 800 pounds of sea water aboard.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source44"><SUP>44</A></SUP> 
After a dangling flight back to the <I>Donner</I>, the spacecraft was lowered to 
the deck and nine minutes later Ham was out. He appeared to be in good condition 
and readily accepted an apple and [318] half an orange.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm#source45"><SUP>45</A></SUP> 
Ham had functioned like a normal chimpanzee in his flight into space. Could homo 
sapiens do as well?
<P>Ham's flight on MR-2 was a significant accomplishment on the American route 
toward manned space flight. Now the Space Task Group knew that even with some 
hazardous malfunction it might reasonably hope to complete a manned ballistic 
mission successfully. Ham's survival, despite a host of harrowing mischances 
over which he had no control, raised the confidence of the astronauts and the 
capsule engineers alike. Except for an intensive effort to redesign the harness 
and impact attenuation system inside the landing bag, an exhausting final 
"quick-fix" led by Rodney G. Rose and Peter J. Armitage of STG, the Mercury 
capsule and all its systems seemed ready to carry man into space. Since 
overacceleration had occurred in both the MR-1A and MR-2 missions, however, the 
booster engineers responsible for "Old Reliable," Wernher von Braun and Joachim 
Kuettner, Kurt Debus and Emil Bertram, neither shared STG's optimism nor yet 
were satisfied that their launch vehicle was man-rated.<A

<P><A name=source23><SUP>23</A> </SUP>Excerpts from messages compiled by Purser, 
special assistant to director, STG, re status of spacecraft No. 5. During one of 
the McDonnell tests, when the air leakage rate was being checked, the inspectors 
found that gas seepage was too great. The best seal they could obtain left a 
leakage rate of 1,725 cc./ min. at 4.9 p.s.i. for 45 minutes, as against the 
specified maximum rate of 650 cc. The defect causing this was found at the 
umbilical connector and traced to warpage of the capsule frame. McDonnell 
reworked the struts and stringers to make a better fit. This is but one sample 
from daily reports to STG about the rework status of one selected component. 
Afterward, on July 5, 1960, STG approved a spacecraft leak rate of 1,000 cc per 
minute. Memo, Richard S. Johnston, Asst. Head, Life Systems Branch, to Chief,

connected with the 12-g emergency maximum advocated by the Air Force in 1958 for 
the "man-in-space" study program. The 12-g maximum desired for the MR-2 mission 
was set for two reasons: (1) It represented the midway point between a normal 
Mercury-Atlas reentry (about 8 g) and the worst Mercury-Atlas reentry (about 16 
g); and (2) normal reentry for the Mercury-Redstone was about 11 to 12 g. STG 
felt it was necessary to study the g-load effects on the chimpanzee in this 
range. The fact that both acceleration and deceleration g loads surpassed 12 
served to prove the supine couch concept.

was measured by a pneumograph consisting of a rubber tube filled with copper 
sulfate solution. Electrical resistance of the solution varied as the tube was 
stretched. At one point during the testing of sensors for measuring the 
primate's respiration, technicians discovered that when the pneumograph was 
attached high on the thorax, the chimp breathed low and vice versa. One solution 
was to use two pneumograph straps in conjunction. <I>Results of the Project

responsibilities. For example, the launch director, located in the blockhouse, 
reported on the readiness of the launch vehicle; the launch conductor, also in 
the blockhouse, was responsible for detailed supervision of launch operations; 
the capsule test conductor had a similar duty on the countdown; and the flight 
director, located in the Mercury Control Center, had detailed flight-control 
responsibility from liftoff to touchdown.

<P><A name=source37><SUP>37</A> </SUP>Memo, Tecwyn Roberts, Flight Dynamics 
Officer, to Flight Director, "Report on Test 3805," Feb. 2, 1961; penciled notes 
on the countdown of MR-2, anon., Jan. 31, 1961. The origin of the popular space 
term "A.OK" is a matter of widespread public interest. In reporting the 
<I>Freedom 7</I> flight, the press attributed the term to Astronaut Shepard, and 
indeed NASA News Release 1-61-99, May 5, 1961, has Shepard report "A.OK" shortly 
after impact. A replay of the flight voice communications tape disclosed that 
Shepard himself did not use the term. It was Col. John A. "Shorty" Powers who 
reported Shepard's condition as "A.OK" in a description of the flight. Tecwyn 
Roberts of STG and Capt. Henry E. Clements of the Air Force had used "A.OK" 
frequently in reports written more than four months before the Shepard flight. 
Roberts attributed coinage of the term to Paul Lein, of the Western Electric 
Co., while the tracking network was being constructed. Lein, however, said that 
"A.OK" was a communal development among communications engineers while circuits 
were first being established downrange from Cape Canaveral. The voice circuits 
at first gave poor quality. The bands were narrow, and the systems operated on 
1,500 cycles. There was much static and background noise. Words got lost in 
voice circuit systems checks. To make transmissions clearer, the communicators 
started using "A.OK" because the letter "A" has a brilliant sound. Other sources 
claim that oldtime railroad telegraphers used "A-OK" as one of several terms to 
report the status of their equipment. Be that as it may, Powers, "the voice of 
Mercury Control," by his public use of "A.OK," made those three letters a 
universal symbol meaning "in perfect working order."

that Ham was excited when returned to Hangar S after his flight. Being unable to 
debrief his handlers, Ham alone knew at this time how grueling his flight had 
been. Flashbulbs and crowding newsmen made him highly agitated, and he snapped 
at several people. Back in his trailer, his suit was not removed until he became 
calm, and at that time a famous "grin" photograph was made. Later, when his 
handler led him back toward a capsule for pictures requested by the TV crews, 
Ham again became highly perturbed. It took three men to calm the "astrochimp" 
for the next round of pictures. On April 2, 1963, Ham was given to the National 
Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., where for the past 
several years he has been in good health and has thrilled many children.

<P><A name=source45><SUP>45</A> </SUP>The amount of water in the spacecraft 
caused great concern to members of STG's Life Systems Group when they found the 
heatshield had punctured holes in the lower pressure bulkhead. Life Systems 
renewed studying alternatives, making either optional or impossible the 
deployment of the landing bag. More drop tests were undertaken by the 
Aeromedical Biophysics Group of the Wright Air Development Division. Simulating 
the Mercury drop rate of about 30 feet per second, the Wright group found that 
human test subjects could sustain impacts of about 35 g and recover from "a 
confused state" in about five seconds. STG considered this within fairly safe 
limits for an interim measure, but the margin of safety was too small to accept 
for the routine operation of a Mercury mission. Memo, Gerard J. Pesman to Assoc. 
Dir., "Use of Impact Bag for Water Landings," Feb. 13, 1961. In all of the 
manned missions the impact bag was deployed.
