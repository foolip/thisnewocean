<H1>Reentry: Aerodynamics to Thermodynamics</H1>[59] The Ames study had been 
specifically requested by NACA Headquarters, which in its initial prospectus on 
the new research airplane project had identified stability and control in 
high-speed, high-altitude flight as one of two areas needing much additional 
research. The other and far more critical area was aerodynamic heating, which 
becomes acute as an object knifes into the atmosphere from the airless 
environment of space and collides with atmospheric molecules of ever-increasing 
density. For several years NACA researchers had been studying aerodynamic 
heating, which begins to be troublesome at about twice sonic speed. The X-15 
program was established largely to return data on heating generated up to mach 
7. But such investigations of thermal stress hardly approached the heating 
problem faced by the military services and the missile industry in their efforts 
to produce a durable warhead for an intercontinental missile. In a typical ICBM 
flight with a peak altitude of 900 miles and a range of 6,500 miles, the 
stagnation temperature in the shock wave at the front of the nose cone could 
reach 12,000 degrees F. This is some 2,000 degrees hotter than the surface of 
the Sun and 10 times the maximum surface temperature that was calculated for an 
X-15 trajectory.<A

Of the myriad puzzles involved in designing, building, and flying the Atlas, the 
first American ICBM, the most difficult and most expensive to solve was reentry 
heating. The popular term "thermal barrier" to describe the reentry problem was 
coined as an analogy to the "sonic barrier" of the mid-1940s, although research 
in the fifties would reveal that the problem could have been described more 
accurately as a "thermal thicket."
<P>During June 1952, in the same summer that NACA had decided to move toward 
space flight research and had proposed an advanced research aircraft, one of the 
scientist-engineers at Ames had made the first real breakthrough in the search 
for a way to surmount the thermal barrier. He was Harry Julian Allen, a senior 
aeronautical engineer at Ames and chief of the High-Speed Research Division 
since 1945. The burly Allen, who signs his technical papers "H. Julian" but who 
is known familiarly as "Harvey," was 42 years old in 1952 and looked more like a 
football coach than a scientist. Holder of a bachelor of arts degree in 
engineering from Stanford University, Allen in 1935 had left the Stanford 
Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, where he had received the degree of 
aeronautical engineer, to join the NACA staff at the Langley laboratory. When 
Ames was opened in 1941, he went west with Smith DeFrance and others from 
Langley.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>At Ames, Allen had invented a technique of firing a gun-launched model 
upstream through a supersonic wind tunnel to study aerodynamic behavior at high 
mach numbers. This notion led to the construction of the Ames supersonic 
free-flight wind tunnel, opened in 1949. The tunnel had a test section 18 feet 
long, one foot wide, and two feet high. By forcing a draft through the tunnel at 
a speed of about mach 3 and by firing a model projectile upstream at a velocity 
[60] of 8,000 feet per second, the Ames researchers could simulate a mach number 
of about 15. Schlieren cameras set up at seven stations along the test section, 
three on the side and four on the top, made shadowgraphs to show airflow 
characteristics over the model and thus determine the aerodynamic forces 
experienced. During the 1950s the facility, constructed at an original cost of 
only about $20,000, was to prove one of NACA's most valuable tools for 
hypersonic investigation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
<P>As a member of one of the panels of the Department of Defense Research and 
Development Board, a group charged with supervising weapons research, Allen was 
intimately familiar with the payload protection dilemma confronting the Air 
Force and Convair, the prime contractor for the difficult Atlas project.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> 
In their designs the Convair engineers had already provided that at the peak of 
the Atlas' trajectory, its nose, containing a nuclear warhead, would separate 
from the sustainer rocket and fall freely toward its target. These exponents of 
the ICBM knew that without adequate thermal protection the nuclear payload would 
burn up during its descent through the atmosphere.
<P>Fifty years of progress in aeronautics had produced more and more slender and 
streamlined aircraft shapes, the objective being to reduce aerodynamic drag and 
increase speed. In approaching the Atlas reentry enigma, the Convair group drew 
from the huge reservoir of knowledge accumulated over the years by 
aerodynamicists and structures experts dealing with airplanes, rockets, and 
air-breathing missiles. The men at Convair fed their data into a digital 
computer, which was supposed to help them calculate the optimum design for 
structural strength, resistance to heat, and free-flight stability in the 
separable nose section of a long-range rocket. The computer indicated that a 
long, needle-nosed configuration for the reentry body, similar to that of the 
rocket research airplanes, would be best for the ICBM. But tests of this 
configuration, using metal models in the supersonic wind tunnel at Ames and in 
rocket launches at Wallops Island, showed that so much heat would be transferred 
to the vehicle that the warhead would [61] shortly vaporize as it plunged 
through the atmosphere. No protection system known at that time could prevent 
its destruction by aerodynamic heating.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>This disclosure evoked another spate of predictions that an intercontinental 
military rocket would not be feasible for many years. And while relatively few 
people were thinking seriously about manned space flight in the early fifties, 
those who were also understood that something radical would have to be done on 
the problem of reentry before it would be practicable to send a man into space 
and recover him.
<P>The man who did something radical was Allen. As Allen put it, the Convair 
engineers "cut off their computer too soon." He took the sharp-nosed Atlas 
reentry shape and began making mathematical calculations, using only a pad and 
pencil. Eventually he reached a conclusion that seemingly contradicted all the 
years of aeronautical research and streamlined aircraft design. For Allen's 
analysis showed that the best way to cut down reentry heating was to discard a 
great deal of one's thinking about orthodox aerodynamics and deliberately design 
a vehicle that was the opposite of streamlined. "Half the heat generated by 
friction was going into the missiles," recalled Allen. "I reasoned we had to 
deflect the heat into the air and let it dissipate. Therefore streamlined shapes 
were the worst possible; they had to be blunt." The Ames researcher determined 
that the amount of heat absorbed by an object descending into the atmosphere 
depended on the ratio between pressure drag and viscous or frictional drag. The 
designer of a reentry body, by shaping the body bluntly, could alter pressure 
drag and thus throw off much of the heat into the surrounding air. When the 
bluff body collided with stratospheric pressures at reentry speeds, it would 
produce a "strong bow shockwave" in front of, and thus detached from, the nose. 
The shock wave, the air itself, would absorb much of the kinetic energy 
transformed into heat as the object entered the atmosphere.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>Allen personally submitted his findings to select persons in the missile 
industry in September 1952. A secret NACA report memorandum embodying his 
conclusions on the blunt-nose design, coauthored by Alfred J. Eggers of Ames, 
went out to industrial firms and the military the next spring. The report bore 
the date April 28, 1953, but six years passed before the paper was declassified 
and published in the annual report of NACA.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>For his conception of the blunt-body configuration, Allen received the NACA 
Distinguished Service Medal in 1957. The award brought sharp criticism from H. 
H. Nininger, director of the American Meteorite Museum at Sedona, Arizona, who 
asserted that he had first proposed the blunt nose for reentry vehicles. In 
August 1952, Nininger, a recognized authority on meteorites, had suggested to 
the Ames laboratory that a blunt shape appeared promising for missile warheads. 
Nininger based his conclusion on his studies of tektites and meteorites, 
contending that the melting process experienced by a meteorite during its 
descent through the aerodynamic atmosphere furnished a lubricant enabling the 
object to overcome air resistance. Nininger's letter evidently came to Ames some 
weeks after Allen, [62] assisted by Eggers, had completed his calculations on 
the relationship between warhead shape and heat convection. At any rate, what 
Allen wanted to do was exactly the reverse of Nininger's suggestion: 
deliberately to shape a reentry body bluntly in order to <I>increase </I>air 
resistance and dissipate a greater amount of the heat produced by the object 
into the atmosphere.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>Allen's high-drag, blunt-nose principle was of enormous interest and benefit 
to the missile designers. It led directly to the Mark I and Mark II nose cones 
developed by the General Electric Company for the Atlas and later for the Thor. 
[63] Years after the discovery, James H. Doolittle, chairman of NACA's Main 
Committee, pointed out that "every U.S. ballistic missile warhead is designed in 
accordance with his once radical precept."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> 
In 1952 the problems of the missilemen were not of immediate concern to 
designers of manned flight systems, not even to those drawing up plans for the 
X-15, which would encounter a greater heating load than any previous airplane. 
Yet Allen's presentation of a new way to minimize the aerodynamic heating of 
reentry not only made possible an ICBM within a few years but "marked the 
potential beginning of manned space flight, with all of its attendant new 
structures and materials problems."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
<P>The blunt-nose concept was just that - a concept. Succeeding years would see 
much experimentation with spheres, cylinders, blunted ogives, and even concave 
shapes at the supersonic free-flight tunnel, ballistic ranges, and various other 
facilities at Ames, at the 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at Langley, and at the 
Pilotless Aircraft Research Station on Wallops Island.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> 
As aerodynamicists began thinking about space flight they would propose a 
variety of configurations for potential manned space vehicles, although all of 
the designs would feature some degree of bluntness. Finally, blunting a reentry 
body furnished only part of the solution to the heating problem. Allen's 
calculations presupposed that some kind of new thermal protection material would 
be used for the structure of a high-drag body. In 1952, aircraft designers and 
structures engineers were working mainly with aluminum, magnesium, and titanium, 
and were giving some attention to such heat-resistant alloys as Monel K, a 
nickel-and-steel metal used in the X-2, and Inconel-X, the basic alloy for the 
X-15.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> 
But it would take much "hotter" materials to protect the payloads of the 
intercontinental and intermediate-range ballistic missiles - the Atlas, the 
Thor, the Jupiter, and later the Titan. Far more materials research was needed 
before the recovery of a manned spacecraft would be practicable.
<P>Early in 1956, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency at Huntsville, Alabama, 
modified some of its medium-range Redstones in order to extend the studies of 
reentry thermodynamics that the Army had pursued at Redstone Arsenal since 1953. 
As modified, the Redstone became a multistage vehicle, which Wernher von Braun 
and his colleagues called the "Jupiter C" (for Composite Reentry Test Vehicle). 
Meanwhile the Air Force conducted its own investigations of reentry in 
conjunction with its nose-cone contractors, General Electric and the Avco 
Manufacturing Corporation, using a special multistage test rocket called the 
X-17, manufactured by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
<P>Two principal techniques for protecting the interior of the nose cone offered 
themselves - "heat sink" and "ablation." The heat sink approach involved using a 
highly conductive metal such as copper or beryllium to absorb the reentry heat, 
thus storing it and providing a mass sufficient to keep the metal from melting. 
The major drawback of a heat sink was its heaviness, especially one made of 
copper. In the ablation method the nose cone was covered with some ceramic 
material, such as fiber glass, which vaporized or "ablated" during the period of 
reentry heating. [64] The vaporizing of the material, the conversion of a solid 
into a gas, dissipated or carried away the heat. Thus the essence of the 
ablation technique was deliberately burning part of the exterior surface of the 
reentry body, but designing the body so that the surface would not burn through 
completely.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
<P>Apparently no consensus existed among students of the reentry problem by late 
1957. The "first generation" ICBM nose cones produced by General Electric, the 
Mark I and Mark II, were blunt, heavy copper heat sinks, and the Air Force had 
decided to use the Mark II on its Thor intermediate-range missile. But the Air 
Force's full-scale tests of the lighter, more sophisticated, but more difficult 
and less tidy ablation process had not begun yet. Meanwhile, the Army and the 
Vitro Corporation, using the exhaust of liquid rocket motors as a heat source 
and the hybrid Redstone in reentry simulations, demonstrated to their own 
satisfaction the practicability of consuming part of the structural material 
during its use, the principle of ablation. The Army's Jupiter-C shot of August 
8, 1957, carrying a scale model Jupiter nose cone to an altitude of 600 miles 
and a range of 1,200 miles, supposedly "proved the feasibility of the 
ablative-type nose cone" and "fulfilled the mission of the reentry test 
program."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> 
Yet the Ballistic Missile Agency engineers at Redstone Arsenal were working only 
on the intermediate-range Jupiter, not on an ICBM. The question of whether an 
Atlas warhead or a manned reentry vehicle could best be protected by the 
heat-sink or ablation method, or by either, remained undetermined. Much time and 
effort would be expended before the Army's claims for ablation would be fully 
verified and accepted.
<P>NACA's official role in this accelerated program of materials research was 
that of tester and verifier. Even so, the NACA experimenters greatly enlarged 
their knowledge of thermodynamics, became well grounded in the new technology of 
thermal protection, and prepared themselves to cope with the heating loads to be 
encountered in manned space flight.
<P>At the request of the Air Force, the Army, and also the Navy (which was 
involved with the Polaris after 1956), NACA devoted an increasing portion of its 
facilities and technical staff to tests of such metals as copper, tungsten, 
molybdenum, and later beryllium for heat sinks, and of ablating materials like 
teflon, nylon, and fiber glass. During 1955-1956 the installation of several 
kinds of high-temperature jets at the Langley and Lewis laboratories greatly 
aided NACA thermodynamics research. These included, at Langley, an acid-ammonia 
rocket jet providing a maximum temperature of 4,100°F and a gas stream velocity 
of 7,000 feet per second, an ethylene-air jet yielding temperatures up to 
3,500°F, and a pebble-bed heater, wherein a stream of hot air was passed through 
a bed of incandescent ceramic spheres. Both Langley and Lewis had electric arc 
jet facilities, in which a high-intensity arc was used to give energy to 
compressed air and raise air pressure and temperatures. The hot, high-pressure 
air then shot through a nozzle to produce a stream temperature of about 
12,000°F. NACA investigators used these high-temperature jets and other research 
tools, including the 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at Langley, to gather data 
eventually [65] reinforcing the Army's contention that ablation was the most 
effective thermal protection method.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile Maxime A. Faget, Paul E. Purser, and other members of the Langley 
Pilotless Aircraft Research Division, working under the supervision of Robert R. 
Gilruth, used multistage, solid-propellant rockets for studying heat transfer on 
variations of Allen's basic blunt heatshield configuration. Robert O. Piland, 
for example, put together the first multistage vehicle to attain mach 10. Faget 
served as a regular NACA member and Purser was an alternate member of a 
Department of Defense panel called the Polaris Task Group, set up to give advice 
on the development of the Navy's intermediate-range, solid-fueled Polaris, which 
was to be launched from submerged submarines. NACA worked with the Atomic Energy 
Commission and the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, prime contractor for the 
Polaris, in developing the heat-sink nose cone used on the early versions of the 
sea-based missile.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
<P>Although there were some 30 different wind tunnels at Langley, the members of 
the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division (PARD) firmly believed in the 
superiority of their rocket-launch methods for acquiring information on heating 
loads and heat transfer, heat-resistant materials, and the aerodynamic behavior 
of bodies entering the atmosphere. As Faget said, "The PARD story shows how 
engineering experimentalists may triumph over theoreticians with preconceptions. 
Our rockets measured heat transfer that the tunnels couldn't touch at that 
time." Joseph A. Shortal, chief of PARD since 1951, recalled, "PARD made us more 
than aeronautical engineers and aerodynamicists. We became truly an 
astronautically oriented research and development team out at Wallops."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>The Ames experimenters, on the other hand, were just as firmly convinced that 
their wind tunnels and ballistic ranges represented the simplest, most 
economical, and most reliable tools for hypersonic research. To the Ames group, 
rocket shots were troublesome and expensive, and rocket telemetry was 
unreliable. As one Ames engineer put it, "You might get a lot of data but since 
you didn't control the experiment you didn't know exactly what it meant."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
<P>The Ames devotion to laboratory techniques, the determination to do more and 
more in heating and materials research without resorting to rockets, furnished 
the impetus for a new test instrument devised by Alfred J. Eggers, Jr., in the 
mid-fifties. Eggers, born in 1922 in Omaha, had joined the research staff at 
Ames in the fall of 1944, after completing his bachelor of arts degree at the 
University of Omaha. He pursued graduate studies at Stanford University in 
nearby Palo Alto, where he received a Master of Science degree in aeronautical 
engineering in 1949 and a Ph.D. in 1956.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> 
For years Eggers had worked with Allen and others at Ames on the aerodynamic and 
thermodynamic problems of hypervelocity flight, and as a conceptualizer at the 
California center he came to be regarded as second only to the originator of the 
blunt-nose reentry principle.
<P>Eggers assumed that the major heating loads of reentry would be encountered 
within an altitude interval of 100,000 feet. So he designed a straight, 
trumpet-shaped [66] supersonic nozzle with a maximum diameter of 20 inches and a 
length of 20 feet, which in terms of the model scale used was equivalent to 
100,000 feet of thickening atmosphere. A hypervelocity gas gun launched a scale 
model upstream through the nozzle to a settling chamber. While in free flight 
through the nozzle to the chamber, the model passed through ever-denser air, 
thus closely approximating the flight history of a long-range ballistic missile. 
Since the apparatus simulated both motion and heating experiences, Eggers called 
the combination of hypervelocity gun and supersonic nozzle "an atmosphere entry 
simulator."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>Eggers calculated that using a model only .36 inch in diameter and weighing 
.005 pound, he could simulate the aerodynamic heating generated by an object 
three feet in diameter, weighing 5,000 pounds, and having a range of 4,000 
miles. "In the simplest test," he said, "the simulator could provide with one 
photograph of a model rather substantial evidence as to whether or not the 
corresponding missile would remain essentially intact while traversing the 
atmosphere." The reentry research technique, proposed in 1955, went into 
operation during the next year. Construction of a larger version began in 1958. 
Eggers' atmosphere entry simulator proved especially useful in materials 
research at Ames. Like the high-temperature jets at Langley and Lewis, the 
rocket tests at Wallops Island, the Army's Jupiter-C shots from Cape Canaveral, 
and other experimental methods, it yielded data that later pointed toward 
ablation as the best method for protecting the interior of reentry bodies.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-3.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>Although the official focus of the NACA materials test program remained on 
missile warhead development, such activity was an obvious prerequisite to manned 
space flight. And the experience of men like Gilruth, Faget, Purser, and Shortal 
in the years before the Sputniks had a direct influence on their plans for 
shielding a human rider from the heat of atmospheric friction. Meanwhile other 
NACA engineers, especially at Langley and at the High Speed Flight Station, were 
working closely with the Navy, the Air Force, and North American Aviation on the 
X-15 project. At Cleveland, Lewis propulsion specialists were studying rocket 
powerplants and fuels as well as cooperating with Langley and Flight Station 
representatives in designing, operating and studying reaction control systems 
for hypersonic aircraft and reentry vehicles.

training a beam of light perpendicular to the direction of the airflow to be 
investigated. A camera is placed behind the light. The camera then photographs a 
stationary or moving object in the light beam and the surrounding air-streaks,

pressures. See Theodore von Kármán, <I>Aerodynamics: Selected Topics in the

for relatively lightweight reentry bodies, as warheads became heavier the total 
heat absorbed and the rate of heating would probably dictate longer, more 
slender shapes. Some blunting at the tip of the body, however, would continue to 
be desirable. This is precisely the evolution that has occurred over the years
