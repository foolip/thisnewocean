<H1>Briefing the Briefers</H1>The initial postflight period of debriefing, held 
aboard the recovery ship, included a medical examination and free dictation by 
the astronaut of his flight impressions. This was followed by a short debriefing 
questionnaire. From the ship, the astronaut was taken to Grand Bahama Island for 
an exhaustive two-day debriefing by medical and technical personnel. This 
session used a prepared list of questions. Interrogations were led by Carmault 
B. Jackson on medical matters, by Robert Voas on pilot activities and 
performance, and by Harold I. Johnson and Sigurd A. Sjoberg on systems 
performance. Some 32 specialists joined in the Grand Bahama debriefing, 
including program managers, operations physicians, engineers, photographers, and 
public relations personnel.
<P>[359] His pressure suit, Shepard said, was generally comfortable and allowed 
sufficient mobility, but the left wrist pressure gauge was difficult to see 
during acceleration. It should be moved, perhaps to the knee. And there was a 
circulation problem caused by the rubber cots at the ends of his gloved fingers, 
which meant he had to keep drawing his fingers back inside the gloves to 
maintain comfort. The helmet was satisfactory. Shepard had obtained an enlarged 
faceplate for his own helmet to gain better vision. He had no complaints against 
the couch or restraint harness. He remembered only minor pressure points from 
the couch while waiting on the pad. The straps around his shoulders had seemed 
tight at times before launch, but slight shrugs had relieved the tension and 
stimulated circulation.
<P>The biosensors caused some skin irritation for Shepard, as they had for 
others in the Mercury program, both astronauts and test subjects. Better 
adhesives were promised. Throughout the mission the suit temperature and 
humidity had been quite comfortable, Shepard reported. During the hours while he 
was waiting on the pad he was able to maintain a suit reading of 75 degrees, 
although this rose to 77 degrees a minute or two before liftoff. His suit 
temperature dropped back to 74.5 degrees for most of the flight, with a brief 
rise to 82 degrees during reentry. Just before the loss of contact as the 
spacecraft dropped below the radio horizon, his suit temperature dropped to 77 
degrees. Then, in the capsule awaiting pickup, Shepard experienced the hottest 
part of the mission. When Byrnes suggested that ventilation procedures should be 
improved, Shepard remarked that he could have obtained some relief by simply 
unzipping his suit.<A

<P>Other parts of the environmental control system also worked satisfactorily. 
The cabin temperature inside <I>Freedom 7</I> stayed within a tolerable range 
from 92 to 100 degrees. Only part of one of the two four-pound bottles of oxygen 
aboard had been needed. The drain on the coolant supply had been slight.
<P>The engineers among the debriefing team quizzed Shepard about the whole of 
the spacecraft attitude control systems, but especially about the workings of 
manual control. According to the flight plan, Shepard was to exercise three 
modes of control - automatic, manual, and the fly-by-wire combination of the 
two. He reported that the manual mode was quite responsive and felt the same as 
the manual mode in the procedures trainers. There seemed to be a tendency for 
the spacecraft to roll slightly clockwise while in the manual control. 
Postflight inspectors found a small piece of debris lodged in the hydrogen 
peroxide tubing, which probably caused the jets to leak a tiny increment of 
thrust. Near the six-minute point in the flight, according to plan, Shepard was 
supposed to switch to the fly-by-wire mode of control. Apparently he forgot to 
turn off the manual valve, so the capsule's attitude control system sucked fuel 
from both manual and automatic tanks. The debriefing interrogators asked him 
whether he got more control than desired; he replied that rate changes seemed 
high but that he thought this was caused by microswitch positions rather than 
the addition of manual proportional fuel. Shepard could not recall for certain 
whether he had turned [360] off the manual valve; telemetry data monitoring the 
spacecraft movements and countermovements indicated that he had not.
<P>The accessory rockets and pyrotechnics on the capsule performed adequately 
during the <I>Freedom 7</I> mission, each sequence firing on time and as 
designed. One exception was a secondary escape- tower jettison rocket, which was 
later disassembled and found to have ignited by manual pull-ring actuation. 
Since Shepard did not remember whether or not he pulled that ring, how the 
rocket fired remained a mystery. It was known that this backup component had not 
been used to separate the escape tower from the spacecraft. Otherwise the 
capsule rocketry had performed flawlessly. The posigrades effected spacecraft 
separation, the three retrograde rockets ripple-fired to provide a 
510-feet-per-second velocity decrement, and the drogue parachute mortar 
discharged correctly. The green sequence lights appeared on Shepard's panel with 
heartwarming regularity except for the retropack jettison indicator.
<P>At impact the landing bag had performed as designed to cushion the shock, but 
one heat sink stud did pierce the fiber-glass protective shield. While the 
pressure vessel was undamaged, recovery had been too rapid for the seaworthiness 
of the impact bag to be tested. Several rips observed in the impact skirt aboard 
the carrier apparently occurred during postflight handling rather than at impact 
or by bobbing in the water.
<P>In general the radio communications during flight had been extremely clear. 
Slayton, the Mercury Control Center capsule communicator ("Cap Com"), said 
Shepard's voice transmissions were slightly garbled at liftoff but that seconds 
later the quality improved markedly. Using the ultra-high-frequency system, 
Slayton was able to maintain crisp contact with <I>Freedom 7</I>. Shepard and 
Slayton stayed on UHF, using the Cape antenna, but then as distance increased, 
voice communications deteriorated. In Mercury Control Center the communications 
technician monitoring the Grand Bahama Island antenna reception switched Slayton 
onto a relay from Bahama, and Shepard came in loud and clear once again. Slayton 
and Shepard communicated well with each other until main parachute deployment. 
The Mercury Control Center communicator then tried unsuccessfully to use 
Cardfile 23, the communications relay airplane. Having lost contact with Cap 
Com, Shepard had expected the recovery forces to garble the radio in competition 
to talk with him, but circuit discipline was businesslike both before and after 
countdown.<A
