Mercury Mission Accomplished</H2>
<P>[411] Prospects looked bright to the
managers of Project Mercury at the beginning of 1962. In store was Mercury-Atlas
6, scheduled as a manned orbital flight and viewed by some as a salvage
operation for America's space prestige. If one of its citizens, Marine pilot
John Glenn, journeyed successfully through space on a multi-orbit global
mission, the United States would at least begin matching the pace set by the
Soviet Union. Although a 3-orbit trek would by no means equal the 17-orbit,
day-long voyage of Gherman S. Titov, the imminence of the mission had helped to
allay national uneasiness somewhat. The notion that the manned orbital launch
should be made in 1961 to coincide with Russian feats in the history books
subsided with the end of the old year; 1962 was now here. Whatever regrets the
American people had harbored over the numerous delays in Project Mercury, they
seemed reconciled to schedule slippages if safety demanded them.
<P>But the new year was barely three days old when the news media learned that
the announced launch date of January 16 had been postponed until January 23, at
the earliest, because of technical problems in the booster fuel tanks. With each
succeeding delay, and there would be several more, journalists and Congressmen
became a little more critical and fidgety. Once again, as on several previous
occasions, the press spoke of the "space gap," and doubts were raised by some
writers that the Mercury undertaking would ever succeed. A senior member of the
House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Republican James G. Fulton of
Pennsylvania, apparently subscribed to this feeling when he remarked, after
viewing a January 27 MA-6 launch attempt, that the Mercury spacecraft and Atlas
booster could be described as "a Rube Goldberg device on top of a plumber's
nightmare." President Kennedy disclosed at a news conference on February 14 that
he too shared the general disappointment voiced about delays in the program, but
he added that the decision to go or not to go should be left to the "group who
are making the judgment." Moreover, he reaffirmed his faith in the NASA Mercury
team: "I'm going to follow their judgment, even though we've had bad luck."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>[412] Statements issued by the Manned Spacecraft Center's operations team
after each postponement of the MA-6 mission were terse and technical, and their
frankness in reporting the reasons for these delays prompted some favorable news
comment. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> commended NASA for its open information
policy, and pointed out that anything but "Candor at Canaveral" could only hurt
the "national image." In response to their persistent and sometimes annoying
questions, reporters were quietly told that this mission had been in the
planning processes for almost three years and that a few more days' or weeks'
delay was of little consequence if confidence in its success could be raised
another notch. This acceptance of the situation by the Cape launch crew and
operations team stemmed from the program's composite flight test experience.
John Glenn, knowing all of this, enjoined the press representatives covering the
event not to worry:<A
href="notes.htm#n13.2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This mission has been in preparation for a long time. I can't get
  particularly shook up about a couple of days' delay. As a matter of fact, I'm
  so happy to have been chosen to be the pilot for this mission that I'm not
  about to get panicky over these delays. I learned very early in the
  flight-test business that you have to control your emotions - you don't let
  these things throw you or affect your ability to perform the
mission.</BLOCKQUOTE>The Mercury team alone knew what had to be right to make it
go.
<P>Back in October 1959, the MA-6 flight, possibly carrying a chimpanzee in
spacecraft No. 18, had been scheduled for launch in January 1961. But the
fortunes or misfortunes of manufacture and the ensuing flight test program
forced many schedule slippages, redesignation of flight order, and capsule
configuration changes to meet altered test objectives. According to an April
1960 chart, the first manned orbital attempt (originally MA-7) was slated for a
May 1961 launch. Six months later the planners moved the target date for this
mission to July, and after a similar interval they foresaw October as the likely
launch date. NASA Headquarters' approval of the proposal to add one-day missions
to the Mercury flight series required further schedule alterations. Several
spacecraft had to be modified for the flights of longer duration. Spacecraft No.
13 was allocated to the MA-6 mission, replacing No. 18, which now was entered
into the modification cycle. In spite of all this shuffling, as late as October
1961 the program managers held hopefully to an anticipated manned orbital
liftoff within 1961. MA-6, instead of MA-7, the managers indicated, would carry
the first astronaut into orbit, providing the MA-5 chimpanzee flight succeeded
in November.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>A host of manufacturing changes had delayed the progress of spacecraft No. 13
as it traveled through the McDonnell production and checkout line. Number 13,
beginning to take form in May 1960, also met with the usual fabrication problems
its predecessors had faced during assembly. On October 10, for example,
McDonnell reported to the Space Task Group that a shortage of environmental
control system components had completely halted work on the capsule's interior.
[413] At the end of January 1961, however, the company had started a three-month
test shakedown of the vehicle. Shortly after the completion of this work the
failure of the MA-3 mission on April 25 had forced a rearrangement of spacecraft
allocations, and McDonnell had been told by the NASA planners to redesign No. 13
for the initial manned orbital mission. The factory finished and delivered the
spacecraft to the Cape on August 27. Four months later, after a thorough
checkout by the Manned Spacecraft Center's (formerly Space Task Group) Cape
team, on January 2, 1962, it was mated to its launch vehicle, Atlas 109-D.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<P>These had been some of the trials that made planning and scheduling difficult
occupations, especially in a program that had been so often under national
scrutiny. Therefore, the successive MA-6 launching delays logged in the early
days of 1962 simply were noted and accepted, and the planners met to decide when
they could be ready to try again.

<H3>Preparing a Man to Orbit</H3>Of course, hardware was only part of the
problem of readying MA-6. What about the second half of the "spacecraft-man"
combination? Would the man be just a passenger-observer or a participating
system? By mid-September 1961, Robert B. Voas, the astronauts' training officer,
had drawn up a number of basic specifications concerning the pilot's duties in
MA-6 in answer to questions of this sort. If some part of the automatic attitude
control system should fail, for example, the pilot would need to control
spacecraft attitude using the manual system. Or if displayed information on the
spacecraft's attitude position should malfunction, the pilot would have to take
over and rely on his visual abilities for position reckoning by external
references. Voas had studied high-altitude photographs of the MA-4 flight and he
knew that on the sunlit side of Earth the horizon should quickly provide an
excellent capsule attitude reference, but the nightside might present problems
unless there was bright moonlight. Possibly known stars could serve as attitude
reference points, he theorized. Voas also felt that a comparison of window and
periscope reference was needed.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
<P>To measure man's potential as a spatial navigator, Voas wanted the astronaut
to look for the smallest detectable landmark, to estimate the effects of weather
conditions on visibility, and to judge precisely the occultation of the stars by
Earth's atmosphere. Theoretically, from the vantage point of the orbital flight
trajectory an astronaut should see about a 900-mile arc of the horizon. He
should be able to determine how much of this was effective horizon in terms of
his ability to recognize a landmark with the unaided eye. One important facet of
any later space exploration, Voas said, would be man's visual acuity in
estimating spatial depth and distance; tracking an artificial object in a nearly
identical orbit during a Mercury circumnavigation would partially test this
ability. The spent Atlas tankage trailing the capsule should offer an excellent
opportunity in this respect.
<P>[414]Ever since the Soviet reports of Gherman Titov's sensations of dizziness
and nausea caused by his head and body movements, some aeromedical specialists
had worried that perhaps the prolonged absence of gravitational stress did
adversely affect a space passenger or pilot. Voas, considering this subject,
contended that it was impossible to say whether Titov had had a purely personal
aversion to weightlessness or whether men in general would have similar troubles
under zero g. Neither Alan Shepard nor Virgil Grissom had experienced vertigo
during the two Mercury suborbital flights. Voas felt that if disorientation and
nausea were in fact products of longer durations of weightlessness, as some
physicians and physiologists believed, the symptoms could be remedied through
preflight training, proper flight procedures, or, if necessary, by drugs.
<P>Voas acquainted the astronauts with the probable effects of weightlessness on
their sensory organs. The otoliths, the ear's angular accelerometers, should not
be affected, he said. Muscle and skin sensory functions should be affected only
slightly, but those muscles sensing the amount of gravity would lose their
acuity completely. By and large, the general diminution of sensory perception
accompanying space flight should be overcome by the astronaut's eyes and his
memory. To test his theories, Voas prescribed an experiment to be conducted on
the dark side of Earth. The pilot would touch certain panel dials with his eyes
open and then with his eyes closed, after moving his head quickly to the right,
left, and forward. Gordon Cooper expressed qualms felt by several people over
Voas' "blind flying" test when he remarked, "You shouldn't be reaching over on
this panel with your eyes shut."
<P>Other tasks planned by Voas included taking pictures through the window and
periscope with a hand-held camera, describing the cloud cover on the day side,
and looking for lightning in squall lines as requested by the United States
Weather Bureau. On the night side the pilot should repeat those tasks and
observe the aurora and luminescence of Earth's clouds. Finally, he should scan
the star fields, the Milky Way, and note the size and appearance of the Moon as
well as describe a moonset.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
<P>The September study by Voas included the initial efforts of the Space Task
Group to foster a scientific inroad into the manned space flight program. After
distributing his paper among the astronauts and receiving favorable comment from
several, Voas then sought the assistance of NASA Headquarters to obtain a
broader base for possible astronaut activities in space from the various
scientific disciplines that were available. Homer E. Newell and Nancy G. Roman
of that organization reacted by directing the formation of an ad hoc committee
for astronomical tasks for the Mercury pilots, assigning Jocelyn R. Gill as the
committee chairman. This group was an offshoot of the formal Astronomy
Subcommittee, a part of NASA's Space Sciences Steering Committee.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
<P>As a beginning Gill and Voas attended a meeting of the Astronomy Subcommittee
held at the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, Bethpage, New York, on
October 30&ndash;31, 1961. Voas reviewed the abilities of the astronauts [415] to
assume some additional tasks, such as observations of astronomical phenomena. He
also cautioned that any integration of scientific equipment inside the
spacecraft would have to be severely restricted in weight. The Astronomy
Subcommittee discussed the possibilities and then suggested 10 tasks that an
astronaut might accomplish. A few of these were: observe the night airglow as to
its intensity and structure, look for comets before sunset and after dawn, note
the frequency of meteor flashes, look for the aurora and describe its intensity,
sketch the zodiacal light relative to the star background, and observe the size
and position relative to the star background of the gegenschein.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>Besides generally acquainting the Mercury astronauts with the spatial
environment, their possible reactions, and what they might accomplish in the way
of operations and scientific observations, Voas also had pressed forward with a
plan for a specific training program to prepare the crewmen to operate and
manage the spacecraft systems on orbital missions. He first compiled a list of
proposed training activities, and then he called a meeting at Langley on
September 26 to discuss his report. The STG officers present adopted the
training proposal, which became a formal working paper on October 13. With
slight subsequent amendments, this working paper, No. 206, spelled out the
astronaut training and preparation procedures that would be followed for the
rest of the Mercury program.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>The first stated prerequisite for the astronaut, as formulated by Raymond G.
Zedekar of STG, was a thorough familiarity with the spacecraft and all its
systems. He must know every mission detail, including every flight and ground
rule; he would be expected to demonstrate peak performance in every task during
the flight; and his skills must include making failure diagnoses and taking the
proper corrective action.
<P>Preparing the pilot for his role during an orbital mission, the astronaut
training personnel obviously could draw heavily on Shepard's and Grissom's
suborbital experiences. The nine separate checkouts of the spacecraft after it
arrived at the Cape, they felt, would provide excellent familiarization and
systems training for the prime pilot and his alternate, who would be assigned to
take turns in the capsule's contour couch. Then, if any modifications to the
hardware or change in methods should become necessary, either man would be fully
prepared to give valuable advice as well as to learn how the component change or
new procedure would affect the mission. But by all accounts, as particularly
ascribed to by the Mercury suborbital pilots, the best training sessions for
practicing both normal and abnormal flight conditions in the Mercury program
were those held in the procedures trainer. There all phases of a mission -
prelaunch, countdown, launch, orbit, reentry, recovery, and emergency - could be
simulated. The training planners decided that at least 30 hours of practice
would be scheduled in this McDonnell-made trainer. On some occasions the
simulation called for hooking the trainer in with the Mercury Control Center and
the Bermuda tracking site, an exercise that also would help the flight
controllers check, promulgate, or practice their communications and control
procedures.
<P>[416] Voas and his colleagues scheduled numerous other training activities
that would supposedly hone the astronauts to a fine edge. One such plan called
for the pilot or his designated stand-in to attend the spacecraft scheduling
meetings, operational planning sessions, and booster, spacecraft, and mission
reviews. After the spacecraft had been mated with the booster, the astronaut
would have a key role in the capsule systems test, sequential and abort
exercises, and the simulated flight that accompanied each countdown launch
simulation. With the astronaut sitting in the spacecraft, all countdown checks
would be run up to the point of hatch installation. Voas' training document
stipulated that even the exercise of slipping the pilot into his capsule should
be practiced until the insertion crew had it down perfectly. Besides all this
work at the Cape, preflight trips were planned to the Morehead Planetarium in
North Carolina, so that the astronaut and his backup pilot could fix star
patterns in their minds as an aid to their orbital celestial observations. To
obtain a familiarity with angular motion, they would attend sessions in the
Pensacola Naval Air Station's "rotating room" and on the human disorientation
device. Egress training, the value of which Grissom vouched for after his
harrowing recovery, was scheduled on the open water in the Atlantic. Finally,
there were Morse code instruction, map study, and briefings by the Weather
Bureau support team on observation procedures.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
<P>All these varied tasks had to be scheduled in logical progression to bring
about a status of "flight readiness." The original training directive specified
that an intensive training program for an upcoming flight should begin with a
comprehensive study of all capsule instrumentation about 81 days before the
launch was scheduled. Nine days later, after the astronaut and his alternate had
memorized everything they could about the capsule instrument panel, they would
start spending at least three hours per week in the procedures trainer, making
brief excursions to Langley for sessions on the air-lubricated, free-axis (ALFA)
trainer. In the procedures trainer they would go through specific mission
profiles. These included a normal one-orbit mission, lasting about 90 minutes,
with the astronaut in casual clothes; five-hour sessions simulating three
orbits, with the astronaut wearing a pressure suit on some occasions; and
30-minute abort simulations, including such hazards as the failure of the
retropackage to jettison, failure of the spacecraft's main batteries shortly
after orbital insertion, and many other malfunctions covering every conceivable
contingency that the training officers could devise.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>By December 1961, after Glenn and Carpenter had been publicly named for the
Mercury-Atlas 6 mission, training plans were expanded to include their medical
evaluations. For the altitude chamber simulated flight conducted about 45 to 60
days before the anticipated launch, Glenn was examined, fitted with biosensors,
suited, pressure-checked, and then loaded into the transfer van and medically
observed during the trip to the altitude test chamber. After he seated himself
in the couch, his biosensor data were checked, his electrocardiogram leads were
monitored, and the newly fabricated blood pressure equipment was exercised. Also
there was a checkout of the spacecraft's environmental control system.<A

<P>[418]Jocelyn Gill also began planning the scientific aspects that Glenn might
attend to while he was in orbit, when she called the first meeting of the ad hoc
committee in Washington on December 1, 1961. William K. Douglas, Voas, and John
J. Van Bockel attended from the Manned Spacecraft Center. The main purpose of
this gathering was to adjust the suggestions emanating from the earlier meeting
of the Astronomy Subcommittee into a workable order to provide the astronauts
with as much background as possible of what they might expect to see in space.
The first piece of equipment for scientific purposes aboard the spacecraft
discussed was a small filter planned for use in studying the irregularities of
the night-sky illumination and aurorae. For later missions an ultraviolet camera
was suggested for possible use in photographing the stellar spectra.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>Some eight days later Glenn, Carpenter, and Schirra accompanied Voas and
Douglas to a second meeting called by Gill. Point by point the requested
astronomical observations were explained to the three astronauts. Because of
their evident interest, Gill was of the opinion that such briefings, perhaps
with even more detailed information, should be provided at intervals as well as
just before flight time.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>During the month before the MA-6 mission, Glenn underwent at the launch site
a realistic test termed "Pad Rehearsal No. 1." This exercise started with
biosensor and suiting-up preparations at the hangar, transportation to the pad,
and insertion of the astronaut into the spacecraft. Both the blockhouse and the
Mercury Control Center were tied into and participated in this exercise. Several
days later this operation was carried out again, and this time the gantry was
pulled away to make conditions more realistic. Then about three days before the
scheduled flight, after he had already begun his low-residue diet, Glenn went
through a simulated mission encompassing the entire flight plan.
<P>Other preflight medical activities included a complete physical examination
two days before the anticipated launch. The Mercury physicians issued Glenn a
number of medications for his survival pack, including morphine for pain,
mephentermine sulfate for shock, benzylamine hydrochloride for motion sickness,
and racemic amphetamine sulfate (a common pep pill) for a stimulant.
Radiation-measuring film packs were tucked inside the spacecraft.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>Glenn and Carpenter had completed most of their preflight training program by
the end of January, but the continuing delay of the MA-6 launch forced them to
go on with their crowded routine. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the
spacecraft during the hangar and altitude test chamber checks and uncounted
hours on the pad after the launch rocket and spacecraft were mated. On the
procedures trainer between December 13, 1961, and February 17, 1962, he logged
59 hours and 45 minutes (far beyond the 30 required by the training directive)
and worked through 70 simulated missions in the process, reacting to some 189
simulated system failures. Glenn and Carpenter, along with Donald Slayton and
Walter Schirra, already picked for MA-7, participated in a two-day (December 11
and 13, 1961) recovery exercise on the Back River near Langley Air Force [419]
Base, Virginia, easily making both top and side hatch exits. Later Glenn and
Carpenter, wearing life vests, carried out a survival equipment exercise off the
beach at Cape Canaveral.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
<P>Not only the pilots but many others were training for the MA-6 mission. On
January 15, 16, and 17, 1962, recovery team swimmers practiced jumping from
helicopters and placing the new auxiliary flotation collar around a boilerplate
capsule. The flight controllers who were to deploy to the remote tracking sites
got their final briefing on January 3 and left for their respective stations,
where they engaged in seven rather extensive network exercises. Mercury Control,
Goddard, and the Bermuda site conducted tests to check the Control
Center-Bermuda abort command sequence. On January 25, Eugene F. Kranz reported
to Christopher C. Kraft, the flight director, that the network team was at its
peak condition. He feared that motivation and performance might decline if the
flight continued to be delayed.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>Although this was to be the first manned orbital flight in Project Mercury,
earlier flights set many precedents in the planning process for such items as
recovery requirements, mission rules, and test objectives, and consequently the
mission planning for MA-6 was almost routine. The launch azimuth heading was to
be the same that Enos had followed into orbit riding MA-5; the recovery forces,
now thoroughly seasoned, although somewhat larger than for MA-5, were stationed
to cover essentially the same landing areas; ignition procedures and range rules
for the launch were about the same as on previous Mercury-Atlas missions.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>

<H3>Buildup for the Space Offensive</H3>Again NASA invited the world's news
media to send representatives to cover one of its launches. On December 5, 1961,
Headquarters informed newspaper and magazine editors that NASA was planning to
accommodate up to 400 accredited reporters. No exact flight date was mentioned,
but the press was told that the launch would occur "either late this year or
early the next."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
All hopes for a 1961 shot were dashed two days later when NASA Headquarters
announced the postponement of MA-6 until early 1962.
<P>Work to assist the news media in covering the event had been proceeding at
the Manned Spacecraft Center for some time. Several months before the MA-6
launch, its Public Affairs Office, then under the direction of Lieutenant
Colonel John A. "Shorty" Powers, began preparing a "Public Information Operating
Plan," giving the estimated dates on which particular phases of the mission plan
would be carried out. Powers evaluated each segment of the plan and recommended
to the press various training and hardware preparation activities that the
reporters might be interested in covering, as well as arranging for the
reporters to cover flight-day activities. News release handouts were prepared
covering almost every conceivable phase of the flight, from what the pilot would
have for breakfast to an intricate discussion of how a spacecraft attitude
control system should work. [420] About five days before the anticipated launch
date, Powers and his troupe established a news center at Cocoa Beach, Florida.
Some of his men were assigned to pass out fact sheets, some were to record
pictorial events surrounding the flight for use by the news media, some were to
seek answers to the myriad technical queries posed by newsmen, and some were
assigned to prepare advisories concerning mission progress status.
<P>Correspondents accredited by NASA, many clad in colorful beach raiment,
descended on the area. They avidly consumed the space agency's prepared
information, interviewed key figures of the NASA-DOD-industry operations team,
sunned on the beach, and pressed for more news and anecdotes after the evening
meal. Some critics likened the atmosphere to that of a circus, but literally
hundreds of thousands of words about every conceivable phase of the manned space
program poured out for the edification of the tax-paying masses.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
Surely in history no program that still essentially was in its research and
development stage had ever been so open to the public through the eyes of the
Fourth Estate.
<P>The first "gathering on the beach" to view the MA-6 launch occurred on a
cloudy Saturday morning, January 27, 1962, after bad weather had forced the
launch to slip day-to-day from January 23, when the firing was first intended.
The countdown ticked on but the overcast remained solid, and a general feeling
swept through the crowd of faithful "bird watchers" that this still was not the
day. Finally, at T minus 20 minutes Walter C. Williams, the mission director,
canceled the shot. The overcast was so heavy that the necessary camera coverage
of the early trajectory events would be impossible. "It was one of those days,"
said Williams later, "when nothing was wrong but nothing was just right either.
I welcomed that overcast."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
John Glenn had been in his spacecraft, <I>Friendship 7</I>, named in a contest
by his own family, a little over five hours. The rescheduling of the launch for
February 1, four days ahead, necessitated emptying and purging the Atlas of its
propellants.

<P>On January 30 the ground support crew once more began fueling Atlas 109-D.
During preflight checkout, a mechanic discovered, by a routine opening of a
drain plug, that there was fuel in the cavity between the structural bulkhead
and an insulation bulkhead separating the fuel and oxidizer tanks. The launch
vehicle team estimated that, since the insulation had to be removed, a maximum
of 10 work days would be needed to correct the problem and to check out the
systems. This delay would slip the launch date, and slipping the launch date
caused problems for the recovery force. Some 24 ships, more than 60 aircraft,
and a number of specialized units, manned by a combined total of 18,000
personnel around the world, had to consider whether they could remain at their
stations for a new date that might very well slip again. When all the tallies
from the widespread units were before the recovery force commander, Rear Admiral
John L. Chew, February 13 seemed the earliest possible next try at MA-6.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>On January 31, amidst an audible groan from more than 600 news-media [421]
representatives who had managed to become accredited, the new launch date two
weeks ahead was announced. Two weeks more at the Cape was too much for most of
the benumbed newsmen; the exodus from the Florida peninsula began immediately.
Only the spacecraft and launch vehicle technicians were left to minister, as
Walter Williams termed it, to the "sick bird." Glenn took several days off to
spend some time with his family at home in Arlington, Virginia. On one occasion
he crossed the Potomac River to the White House for a brief visit with President
Kennedy, who asked him many semitechnical questions about plans and systems for
the orbital flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
<P>On February 9, as NASA personnel began to move back to the Cape, the weather
was still foul. Evidently the newsmen felt there was little chance for a
launching on the scheduled date; by the 13th only 200 had checked in at the
motels in nearby Cocoa Beach. They received some grist for the journalistic mill
at a press briefing arranged by NASA's Paul P. Haney and "Shorty" Powers. Robert
L. Foster from McDonnell answered some questions about the spacecraft and Major
Charles L. Gandy and Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth E. Grine of the Air Force
answered others on the launch vehicle work and the general state of readiness
for the flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
<P>[422] The turbulent February weather in Florida improved little in succeeding
days, and the space pilot continued to train. On the 15th, for example, Glenn,
learning upon awakening that the weather still held up the launch, slept until
9:30 a.m., had breakfast, spent two hours on the procedures trainer, and that
afternoon studied the flight plan and technical documentation.
<P>On February 19 the sky brightened; so did the spirits of the operations crew,
who immediately began the 610-minute split countdown. During the afternoon the
Department of Defense recovery force weather observers in the Atlantic reported
to Williams that they had favorable weather conditions. At the Cape, however,
the Weather Bureau personnel observed a frontal system moving across central
Florida which, they surmised, could cause broken cloudiness over the Cape area
on Tuesday morning (February 20). Williams, hoping for the best, decided to
continue and ordered the launch crew to pick up the second half of the countdown
at 11:30 p.m. on the evening of the 19th.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile Glenn restudied the detailed mission sequence, first reviewing the
countdown progress and then looking over his flight plan and checking the
equipment list. That afternoon he attended another "final" mission review
meeting, called by Williams. Glenn believed an astronaut should study his
spacecraft's systems until the last possible minute before a flight. Shortly
before he went to bed that night he read a section in the flight controller's
handbook on the automatic stabilization and control system.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>

<H3>An American in Orbit</H3>Glenn was awakened once again at 2:20 a.m. on
February 20. After showering, he sat down to a breakfast of steak, scrambled
eggs, toast, orange juice, and coffee. At 3:05 the astronauts' flight surgeon,
William Douglas, gave him a brief physical examination.
<P>Douglas, Glenn, and his suit technician, Joe W. Schmitt, were only three of a
multitude hard at work on the cloudy February morning. In the Mercury Control
Center procedures log, the flight control team noted at 3:40 that they were "up
and at it." The team immediately conducted a radar check, and although
ionospheric conditions made the results poor the controllers believed the
situation would improve soon. So they went on to check booster telemetry and the
Control Center's voice intercom system, both of which were in good order.
Shortly thereafter they found a faulty communication link that was supposed to
be obtaining information about the capsule's oxygen system, but within minutes
they had corrected the problem.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
<P>At 4:27 a.m. Christopher Kraft, sitting before his flight director's console,
received word that the global tracking network had been checked out and was
ready. In Hangar S, Douglas placed the biosensors on Glenn, and Joe Schmitt
began helping the astronaut don his 20-pound pressure suit. At 5:01 the Mercury
Control Center learned that the astronaut was in the van and on his [423] way to
the launch pad. The van moved slowly and arrived at 5:17, 20 minutes behind
schedule. But the delay was of little consequence, for at 5:25 (T minus 120
minutes) trouble had cropped up in the booster's guidance system. Since this
came during the built-in 90-minute hold part of the countdown for the astronaut
insertion activity, the delay was not likely to halt the readying procedures for
very long. The installation of a spare unit and an additional 45 minutes
required for its checkout, however, made a total of 135 minutes lost.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>Because of overcast weather and the guidance problem in the Atlas, Glenn
relaxed comfortably in the van until 5:58, when the sky began to clear. The
capsule and booster validation checks were progressing normally as he emerged
from the van, saluted the onlookers, and boarded the gantry elevator. At 6:03,
the operations team noted in its procedures log, the astronaut "put a foot into
the spacecraft." Once inside <I>Friendship 7</I>, Glenn noticed that the
respiration sensor - a thermistor attached to the astronaut's microphone in the
air stream of his breath - had shifted from where it had been fixed during the
simulated flight. Stanley C. White pointed out to Williams that a correction
could only be made by opening the suit, a very tricky operation atop the gantry.
So the two officials decided to disregard the slipped thermistor, even though
faulty data would result. White advised the range to ignore all respiratory
transmissions.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<P>At last the technicians began to bolt the hatch onto the spacecraft, but at
7:10, with the countdown proceeding and most of the 70 bolts secured, a broken
bolt was discovered. Although Grissom had flown in MR-4 with a broken hatch
bolt, Williams, taking no chances this time, ordered removal and repair. Taking
the hatch off and rebolting would require about 40 minutes, so the operations
team took this opportunity to run still another check of the guidance system on
Atlas 109-D. Glenn evidently maintained his composure during this hold, with his
pulse ranging between 60 and 80 beats per minute. When a little more than half
of the bolts had been secured, he peered through the periscope and remarked to
Scott Carpenter and Alan Shepard in the Control Center, "Looks like the weather
is breaking up."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
<P>Minutes later the hatch installation was completed and the cabin purge was
started. A check of the cabin oxygen leakage rate indicated 500 cubic
centimeters per minute, well within design specifications. At 8:05, T minus 60
minutes, the countdown continued, but after 15 minutes a hold was called to add
about 10 gallons of propellant to the booster's tanks. Glenn had been busily
going over his capsule systems checklist. As the holds continued, he occupied
his time and relieved the pressure at various points on his cramped body by
pulling on the bungee-cord exercising device in front of his head in the
capsule. The countdown resumed while the liquid oxygen was being pumped aboard
the Atlas, but at T minus 22 minutes, 8:58, a fuel pump outlet valve stuck,
causing still another hold.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>At that point in the countdown, Glenn, the blockhouse and Control Center
crews, and workers scurrying around and climbing on the gantry were joined by
some 100 million people watching television sets in about 40 million homes [426]
throughout the United States. Countless others huddled around radios in their
homes or places of business and about 50,000 "bird watchers" stood on the
beaches near Cape Canaveral, squinting toward the erect rocket gleaming in the
distance. Some of the more hearty and sun-tanned spectators had been at the Cape
since mid-January and had organized trailer towns, complete with "mayors."
Mission announcer Powers, popularly known as "the voice of Mercury Control," who
had been at his post in the Control Center since 5 o'clock that morning, went on
the air to advise the waiting public of the status of the countdown and the
cause for the present hold.
<P>With the stuck valve cleared, the count picked up at 9:25, but another
suspenseful moment came at 6&frac12; minutes before launch time, when the Bermuda
tracking station experienced an electrical power failure. Although the breakdown
was brief, it took several more minutes to steady the Bermuda computer.

<P>At 9:47, after two hours and 17 minutes of holds and three hours and 44
minutes after Glenn entered his "office," <I>Friendship 7</I> was launched on
its orbital journey. The Atlas, supported by its tail of fire, lifted off its
pad, and Powers made the announcement that this country had waited three long
years to hear: "Glenn reports all spacecraft systems go! Mercury Control is go!"
As Atlas 109-D lunged spaceward, Glenn's pulse rate climbed to 110, as expected.
The Atlas and its control systems telemetered signals that they were functioning
perfectly.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
<P>Half a minute after liftoff the General Electric-Burroughs guidance system
locked onto a radio transponder in the booster to guide the vehicle until it was
through the orbital insertion "window." The vibration at liftoff hardly bothered
Glenn, but a hundred seconds later at max-q he reported, "It's a little bumpy
about here." After the rocket plunged through the max-q region, the flight
smoothed out; then two minutes and 14 seconds after launch, the outboard booster
engines cut off and dropped away. Glenn saw a wisp of smoke and fleetingly
thought the escape tower had jettisoned early, but that event occurred exactly
on time, 20 seconds later.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
<P>When the tower separated, the vehicle combination pitched over still further,
giving Glenn his first view of the horizon, which he described as "a beautiful
sight, looking eastward across the Atlantic." Vibration increased as the fuel
supply spewed out the sustainer engine nozzle, then abruptly stopped when the
sustainer shut down. The sustainer had accelerated the capsule to a velocity
only seven feet per second below nominal and had put the Atlas into an orbital
trajectory only .05 of a degree low. Joyously the operations team noted in the
log, "9:52---We are through the gates." Glenn received word that he could make
at least seven orbits with the orbital conditions MA-6 had achieved. To
Goddard's computers in Maryland the orbital insertion conditions appeared good
enough for almost 100 orbits.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>Although the posigrade rockets kicked the capsule loose from the booster at
the correct instant, the five-second rate-damping operation started two and a
half seconds late. This brief lapse caused a substantial initial roll error just
as the [427] capsule began its turnaround. The attitude control system managed
the deviation very well, but it was some 38 seconds before <I>Friendship 7</I>
dropped into its proper orbital attitude. Turnaround spent 5.4 pounds of fuel
from a total supply of 60.4 pounds (36 for automatic and 24.4 for manual
control). Despite his slow automatic positioning maneuver, Glenn made his
control checks with such ease that it seemed, he said, as if he were sitting in
the procedures trainer. As Voas had asked him to do, the astronaut peered
through the window at the tumbling Atlas tankage. It had come into view exactly
as Ben F. McCreary of MSC had predicted it would. He could see the spent vehicle
turning end over end, and he called out estimates of distances between the
separating vehicles: "One hundred yards, two hundred yards." At one point
Glenn's estimate matched the telemetry signal exactly. He visually tracked the
sustainer intermittently for about eight minutes.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>Glenn, noticing the onset of weightlessness, settled into orbital free flight
with an inertial velocity of 17,544 miles per hour and reported that zero g was
wholly pleasant. Although he could move well and see much through his
trapezoidal window, he wanted to see even more. "I guess I'd like a glass
capsule," he later quipped. Weightlessness also helped him as he used the
hand-held camera. When his attention was drawn to a panel switch or readout, he
simply left the "weightless" camera suspended and reached for the switch.
Dutifully carrying out all of the head and body movements requested by Voas, he
experienced none of the sensations reported by Gherman Titov. While any
Glenn-Titov comparison might be ruled invalid since Titov reportedly became
nauseated on his sixth orbit and Glenn flew only three orbits, MA-6 at least was
to demonstrate to the American medical community that there were no discernible
adverse physiological effects from over four hours of weightlessness.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>The first orbit of <I>Friendship 7</I> began ticking off like clockwork with
the Canary Islands reporting all capsule systems in perfect working order.
Looking at the African coastline, and later the interior over Kano, Nigeria,
Glenn told the tracking station team that he could see a dust storm. Kano flight
communicators replied that the winds had been quite heavy for the past week.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
<P>Glenn, completing his spacecraft systems checks over the Canaries, had
commented that he was getting a little behind in his schedule but that all
systems still were "go." Then, over Kano, he had commenced his own first major
yaw adjustment, involving a complete turnaround of the capsule until he was
facing his flight path. Glenn noted that the attitude indicators disagreed with
what he could see were true spacecraft attitudes. Despite the incorrect panel
readouts, he was pleased to be facing the direction his spacecraft was going.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>Over the Indian Ocean on his first orbit, Glenn became the first American to
witness the sunset from above 100 miles. Awed but not poetically inclined, the
astronaut described the moment of twilight simply as "beautiful." Space sky was
very black, he said, with a thin band of blue along the horizon. He could see
the cloud strata below, but the clouds in turn prevented his seeing a mortar
flare fired by the Indian Ocean tracking ship. Glenn described the remarkable
sunset: [428] the sun went down fast but not quite as quickly as he had
expected; for five or six minutes there was a slow but continuous reduction in
light intensity; and brilliant orange and blue layers spread out 45 to 60
degrees on either side of the sun, tapering gradually toward the horizon.
<P>On the nightside of Earth, nearing the Australian coastline, Glenn made his
planned star, weather, and landmark observations. He failed to see the dim light
phenomenon of the heavens called the zodiacal light; he thought his eyes had not
had sufficient time to adapt to the darkness. Within voice radio range of the
Muchea, Australia, tracking station, Glenn and Gordon Cooper began a long
space-to-Earth conversation. The astronaut reported that he felt fine, that he
had no problems, and that he could see a very bright light and what appeared to
be the outline of a city. Cooper answered that he probably saw the lights of
Perth and Rockingham. Glenn also said that he could see stars as he looked down
toward the "real" horizon - as distinguished from the haze layer he estimated to
be about seven or eight degrees above the horizon on the nightside - and clouds
reflecting the moonlight. "That sure was a short day," he excitedly told Cooper.
"That was about the shortest day I've ever run into."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>Moving onward above the Pacific over Canton Island, Glenn experienced an even
shorter 45-minute night and prepared his periscope for viewing his first sunrise
in orbit. As the day dawned over the island, he saw literally thousands of
"little specks, brilliant specks, floating around outside the capsule." Glenn's
first impression was that the spacecraft was tumbling or that he was looking
into a star field, but a quick hard look out of the capsule window corrected
this momentary illusion. He definitely thought the luminescent "fireflies," as
he dubbed the specks, were streaming past his spacecraft from ahead. They seemed
to flow leisurely but not to be originating from any part of the capsule. As
<I>Friendship 7</I> sped over the Pacific expanse into brighter sunlight, the
"fireflies" disappeared.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>The global circuit was proceeding without any major problems, and Glenn still
was enjoying his extended encounter with zero g. He ran into some bothersome
interference on his broadband HF radio when he tried to talk with the Hawaiian
site at Kauai. An aircraft from the Pacific Missile Range tried unsuccessfully
to locate the noise source. Other than the mystery of the "fireflies" and the
intermittent HF interference, the mission was going fine, with the capsule
attitude control system performing perfectly.
<P>Then the tracking station at Guaymas, Mexico, informed the control center in
Florida that a yaw reaction jet was giving Glenn an attitude control problem
that, as he later recalled, "was to stick with me for the rest of the flight."
This was disheartening news for those in the operations team, who remembered
that a sticking fuel valve discovered during the second orbital pass of the
chimpanzee Enos had caused the early termination of MA-5. If Glenn could
overcome this control problem he would furnish confirmation for Williams' and
others' contention that man was an essential element in the loop. If the
psychologists' [429] failure task analyses were correct, the flexibility of man
should now demonstrate the way to augment the reliability of the machine.
<P>Glenn first noticed the control trouble when the automatic stabilization and
control system allowed the spacecraft to drift about a degree and a half per
second to the right, much like an automobile with its front wheels well out of
alignment. This drift initiated a signal in the system that called for a
one-pound yaw-left thrust, but there was no rate response. Glenn immediately
switched to his manual-proportional control mode and eased <I>Friendship 7</I>
back to orbital attitude. Then, switching from mode to mode, he sought to
determine how to maintain the correct attitude position with the least cost in
fuel. He reported that fly-by-wire seemed most effective and economical. Mercury
Control Center recommended that he stay with this control system. After about 20
minutes the malfunctioning thruster mysteriously began working again, and with
the exception of a few weak responses it seemed to be working well by the time
Glenn was over Texas. After only about a minute of automated flight, however,
the opposing yaw-right thruster ceased to function. When similar trials and
waiting did not restore the yaw-right jet, Glenn realized that he would have to
live with the problem and become a full-time pilot responsible for his own
well-being.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
<P>To the operations team at the Cape and to the crews at the tracking sites,
Glenn appeared to be coping with his attitude control problem well, even though
he had to omit many of his observational assignments. But a still more serious
problem bothered the Cape monitors as <I>Friendship 7</I> moved over them. An
engineer at the telemetry control console, William Saunders, noted that "segment
51," an instrument providing data on the spacecraft landing system, was
presenting a strange reading. According to the signal, the spacecraft heatshield
and the compressed landing bag were no longer locked in position. If this was
really the case, the all-important heatshield was being held on the capsule only
by the straps of the retropackage. Almost immediately the Mercury Control Center
ordered all tracking sites to monitor the instrumentation segment closely and,
in their conversations with the pilot, to mention that the landing-bag deploy
switch should be in the "off" position. Although Glenn was not immediately aware
of his potential danger, he became suspicious when site after site consecutively
asked him to make sure that the deploy switch was off. Meanwhile the operations
team had to decide how to get the capsule and the astronaut back through the
atmosphere with a loose heatshield. After huddling for several minutes, they
decided that after retrofire the spent retropackage should be retained to keep
the shield secure during reentry. William M. Bland, Jr., in the control center,
hurriedly telephoned Maxime A. Faget, the chief designer of the Mercury
spacecraft, in Houston, to ask if there were any special considerations they
needed to know or to watch. Faget replied that everything should be all right,
providing all the retrorockets fired. If they did not, the retropack would have
to be jettisoned, because any unburned solid propellant would ignite during
reentry. [430] The operations team concluded that retaining the retropack was
the only possible way of holding the shield in place and protecting Glenn during
the early portion of his return to the dense atmosphere. The men in Mercury
Control realized that the metallic retropack would burn away, but they felt that
by the time it did, aerodynamic pressures would be strong enough to keep the
shield in place. The decision once made, the members of the operations team
fought off a gnawing uneasiness throughout the rest of the flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
This uneasiness was transmitted to the TV and radio audience before actual
retrofire.
<P>Meanwhile <I>Friendship 7</I> was vaulting the Atlantic on its second orbital
pass, and Glenn was busy keeping his capsule's attitude correct and trying to
accomplish as many of the flight plan tasks as possible. He had advised Virgil
Grissom at Bermuda that the oculogyric test, involving visually following a
light spot, had just been completed. Near the Canary Islands the sun, streaming
through his window, made Glenn a little warm, but he refused to adjust the water
coolant control on his suit circuit. This time around he observed that evidently
the "fireflies" outside the spacecraft had no connection with the gas from the
reaction control jets. Glenn skillfully positioned his ship to take some
photographs of the cloud masses and Earth spinning past beneath him. As he mused
over a small bolt floating around inside the capsule, the Kano and Zanzibar
sites monitoring the capsule suddenly noted a 12 percent drop in the secondary
oxygen supply.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile the Indian Ocean tracking ship was preparing for the second-pass
observation experiment. Battened down for heavy weather, the Mercury support
crew decided that releasing balloons for Glenn to try to see was out of the
question and instead they fired star-shell parachute flares. Glenn, however, was
able to observe only lightning flashes in the storm clouds below.
<P>Over the Indian Ocean, Glenn finally decided to adjust the water coolant flow
in the suit circuit to improve on a condition he described as "comfortably
warm." By the time he was over Woomera, Australia, the light signal warning of
excess cabin water told him that the humidity level was rising. From then on
throughout the rest of the flight he had to balance his suit cooling carefully
against the cabin humidity, but the temperature inside his suit was never more
than moderately uncomfortable. Another warning light appeared over Australia,
indicating that the hydrogen peroxide fuel supply for the automatic system was
down to 62 percent. Mercury Control Center recommended letting the capsule drift
in orbit to conserve fuel. Glenn also complained that the roll horizon scanner
did not seem to be working too well on the nightside of Earth and that it was
difficult for him to obtain a visual reference to check the situation. To get a
better view of Earth's horizon he pitched the spacecraft slightly downward,
which helped some.
<P>For the remainder of the second orbit and while going on into the third pass,
<I>Friendship 7</I> encountered no new troubles. Glenn continued to control his
attitude without allowing too much drift, and consequently consumed considerably
more fuel than the automatic system would have used had the control system been
working normally. He had used six pounds from the automatic tank and 11.8 pounds
[431] from the manual on the second orbit, or almost 30 percent of his total
supply. While he had to pay close attention to the control system to hold the
fuel expenditure as low as possible, he still had opportunities for making
observations, photographing the constellation Orion, and executing a third
180-degree yaw maneuver.
<P>On the last orbital circuit of <I>Friendship 7</I>, the Indian Ocean tracking
ship gave up on the release of objects for pilot observation; cloud coverage was
still too thick. There was still time enough for a little joking between Cooper,
at Muchea, and Glenn. The pilot quite formally requested the "down under"
communicator to tell General David Shoup, Commandant of the Marine Corps, that
three orbits should suffice for his minimal monthly requirement of four hours'
flying time. Glenn asked that he be certified as eligible for his regular flight
pay increment.
<P>Now that <I>Friendship 7</I> was halfway through its last orbit, Williams and
Kraft decided to try once more to find out all they could about the heatshield
before Glenn and his ship plunged through the searing reentry zone. At Kraft's
order, the Hawaiian tracking site told Glenn to place the landing bag deploy
switch in the automatic position. Then, if a light came on, he should enter with
the retropack in place. Coupling this with past queries about this switch, Glenn
thoroughly deduced his situation. He ran the test, reported that no light
appeared, and added that he could hear no loose bumping noises when the
spacecraft's attitude changed. The ground crew leaders differed regarding the
best possible procedure to follow: Capsule systems monitors in the Control
Center thought that the retropack should be jettisoned, while the data reduction
crew urged that it be retained. This left the final decision up to Kraft and
Williams. They weighed the information they had received and decided it would be
safer to keep the retropack. Walter Schirra, the California communicator, passed
the order to Glenn to retain the retropack until he was over the Texas tracking
station.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile Glenn was preparing for reentry. Keeping the retrorocket package on
meant that he had to retract the periscope manually and activate the .05-g
sequence by pushing the override switch. Then, while nearing the California
coastline, a little more than four hours and 33 minutes after launch, the
spacecraft assumed its critical retrofire attitude alignment and the first
retrorocket fired. "Boy, feels like I'm going halfway back to Hawaii," Glenn
reported. Seconds later, in orderly succession, the two remaining rockets
executed the braking process. The attitude controls maintained spacecraft
position exactly throughout the retrofire sequence; about six minutes after the
first retrorocket fired, Glenn carefully pitched the conical end of the
spacecraft up to the correct, 14-degree negative-pitch attitude for its downward
plunge through the atmosphere.
<P>Now came one of the most dramatic and critical moments in all of Project
Mercury. In the Mercury Control Center, at the tracking stations, and on the
recovery ships ringing the globe, engineers, technicians, physicians, recovery
personnel, and fellow astronauts stood nervously, stared at their consoles, and
listened to the communications circuits. Was the segment 51 reading on the
landing bag and heatshield correct? [432] If so, would the straps on the
retropack keep the heatshield in place long enough during reentry? And even if
they did, was the thermal protection designed and developed into the Mercury
spacecraft truly adequate? Would this, America's first manned orbital flight,
end in the incineration of the astronaut? The whole Mercury team felt itself on
trial and awaited its verdict.
<P>Glenn and <I>Friendship 7</I> slowed down during their long reentry glide
over the continental United States toward the hoped-for splashdown in the
Atlantic. The Corpus Christi station told Glenn to retain the retropack until
the g meter before him read 1.5. Busily involved with his control problems,
Glenn reported over the Cape that he had been handling the capsule manually and
would use the fly-by-wire control mode as a backup. Mercury Control then gave
him the .05-g mark, and the pilot punched the override button, saying later that
he seemed to be in the fringes of the g field before he pushed. Almost
immediately Glenn heard noises that sounded like "small things brushing against
the capsule." "That's a real fireball outside," he radioed the Cape, with a
trace of anxiety perhaps evident in his tone. Then a strap from the retropackage
swung around and fluttered over the window, and he saw smoke as the whole
apparatus was consumed. Although his control system seemed to be holding well,
his manual fuel supply was down to 15 percent, with the deceleration peak still
to come. So he switched to fly-by-wire and the automatic tank supply.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
<P><I>Friendship 7</I> came now to the most fearful and fateful point of its
voyage. The terrific frictional heat of reentry enveloped the capsule, and Glenn
experienced his worst emotional stress of the flight. "I thought the retropack
had jettisoned and saw chunks coming off and flying by the window," he said
later. He feared that the chunks were pieces of his ablation protection, that
the heatshield might be disintegrating, but he knew there was nothing to gain
from stopping work.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>Shortly after passing the peak g region, the spacecraft began oscillating so
severely that Glenn could not control the ship manually. <I>Friendship 7</I>
swung far past the "tolerable" 10 degrees on both sides of the zero-degree
point. "I felt like a falling leaf," Glenn would recall. So he cut in the
auxiliary damping system, which helped to stabilize the large yaw and roll rates
to a more comfortable level. Fuel in the automatic tanks, however, was getting
low. Obviously the heatshield had stayed in place; Glenn was still alive. But
now he wondered whether his capsule would remain stable down to an altitude at
which the drogue parachute could be deployed safely.
<P>The pilot's fears proved real when both fuel supplies ran dry. Automatic fuel
gave out at 111 seconds, and manual fuel depleted at 51 seconds, before the
drogue deployment. The oscillations rapidly resumed, and at about 35,000 feet
Glenn decided he had better try to deploy the drogue manually lest the
spacecraft flip over into an antenna-downward instead of a heatshield-downward
position. But just as he lifted his hand toward the switch, the drogue
automatically shot out at 28,000 feet instead of the nominal 21,000. Suddenly
the spacecraft straightened out and, as Glenn reported, "everything was in good
shape."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>[433] All systems in <I>Friendship 7</I> worked with precision for the
remainder of the flight. At about 17,000 feet the periscope opened again for the
pilot's use. Glenn, instead, glanced out the window, but it was coated with so
much smoke and film that he could see very little. The spacecraft stabilized in
its descent; the antenna section jettisoned; and Glenn, with immense relief,
watched the main chute stream out, reef, and blossom. The Florida control center
reminded Glenn to deploy the landing bag. He flipped the switch, saw the green
light confirmation, and felt a comforting "clunk" as the shield and impact bag
dropped into position four feet below the capsule. Glenn watched the ocean
coming up to meet him and braced as the gap closed. Jolted by an impact that was
more reassuring than stunning, he bobbed in the water, checked his watertight
integrity, and relayed his elation that a successful MA-6 mission seemed
assured.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P><I>Friendship 7</I> had splashed into the Atlantic about 40 miles short of
the predicted area, as retrofire calculations had not taken into account the
spacecraft's weight loss in consumables. The <I>Noa</I>, a destroyer code-named
Steelhead, had spotted the spacecraft during its descent. From a distance of
about six miles the destroyer radioed Glenn that it could reach him shortly.
Seventeen minutes later, the <I>Noa</I> cruised alongside; a sailor smartly
cleared the spacecraft antenna; and Boatswain's Mate David Bell deftly attached
a davit line for pickup. During the hoist upward the spacecraft bumped solidly
against the side of the destroyer. Once <I>Friendship 7</I> was lowered to the
mattress pallet, Glenn began removing paneling, intending to leave the capsule
through the upper hatch. But it was too hot, and the operation was too slow for
the already long day. So he told the ship's crew to stand clear, carefully
removed the hatch detonator, and hit the plunger with the back of his hand. The
plunger recoiled, cutting Glenn's knuckles slightly through his glove and giving
him the only injury he received during the whole mission. A loud report
indicated that the hatch was off. Eager hands pulled out the smiling astronaut,
whose first words were "It was hot in there."
<P>Lieutenant Commander Robert Mulin of the Navy and Captain Gene McIver of the
Army, physicians assigned to the Mercury recovery team, described Glenn as being
hot, sweating profusely, and fatigued. He was lucid but not loquacious, thirsty
but not hungry. After drinking a glass of water and showering, he became more
talkative. Asked if he felt any "stomach uneasiness" either during the flight or
while he lolled the 17 minutes in the floating spacecraft waiting for pickup,
Glenn admitted only to some "stomach awareness," beginning after he was down on
the water. But there was no nausea, and the examining physicians assured
themselves that Glenn's condition was caused by heat, humidity, and some
dehydration. He had lost five pounds, five ounces from his preflight weight of
171 pounds, seven ounces. He had consumed the equivalent of only 94 cubic
centimeters of water, in the form of applesauce puree, during the flight, while
his urine output was 800 cubic centimeters. He also had perspired profusely
while awaiting pickup.
<P>Glenn's temperature an hour after landing was 99.2 degrees, or only a degree
[434] higher than his preflight reading, and by midnight he recorded a normal
temperature. His blood pressure registered only a fraction higher than the
preflight readings. The condition of his heart and lungs was normal before and
after the mission, and there was nothing unusual about his skin except the
superficial abrasions on the knuckles, caused by opening the hatch. By the time
President Kennedy called his personal congratulations by radio telephone to
Glenn aboard the <I>Noa</I>, the "wonderful trip - almost unbelievable" was over,
Glenn was safe and sound, and 100 million American television viewers had
happily ceased their vigil.
<P>After recording on tape a "self-debriefing" aboard the <I>Noa</I>, Glenn was
transferred to the carrier <I>Randolph</I>, where his chest was x-rayed, an
electrocardiogram was made, and the initial phase of the technical debriefing
was started. From there the astronaut was transported to Grand Turk Island,
where a much more thorough physical began about 9:30 p.m., under the direction
of Carmault B. Jackson, assistant to Flight Surgeon Douglas. February 20, 1962,
proved to be "a long day at the office" for Glenn. After exhaustive tests and
observations the attending physicians could find no adverse effects from Glenn's
threefold circumnavigation in space. Technical debriefings continued for two
days on the island and then moved to the Cape for another day's session.
<P>The postflight analysis of Glenn's use of the three-axis handcontroller
during reentry showed that about half of the thrust pulses he initiated opposed
the direction of spacecraft motion, as they were supposed to. But the other half
of the handcontroller movements either reinforced oscillating motions or had no
net damping effect. The issue of "pilot-induced error" was picked up by some
newsmen and reported as a controversy rather than a problem.
<P>Now that the primary objectives of Project Mercury had been achieved at last
in grand style, the drive for perfection in performance, so indispensable to
manned space flight, still did not slow down.<A

<H3>The Hero</H3>The American reaction to this country's first manned orbital
flight was a mixture of relief, pride, and exaltation. From the Rose Garden at
the White House, President Kennedy echoed the sentiments of the Nation:<A
href="notes.htm#n13.50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I know that I express the great happiness and thanksgiving of all
  of us that Colonel Glenn has completed his trip, and I know that this is
  particularly felt by Mrs. Glenn and his two children.
  <P>I also want to say a word for all of those who participated with Colonel
  Glenn at Canaveral. They faced many disappointments and delays - the burdens
  upon them were great - but they kept their heads and they made a judgment, and
  I think their judgment has been vindicated.
  <P>We have a long way to go in this space race. But this is the new ocean, and
  I believe the United States must sail on it and be in a position second to
  none.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>[435] Not only Americans but friendly foreigners hastened
to add their praises for Glenn and Project Mercury. India's news media gave the
flight top billing over an important national election. Most of the South
American press viewed the space gap as already closed or being closed, while a
sense of relief that a more favorable balance of power existed was evident in
the African newspapers. Western Europeans were pleased with the openness of the
undertaking, with the fact, frequently mentioned, that the United States had not
used this momentous event to intimidate either opponent or neutral, and that the
astronaut had kept his inflight remarks strictly apolitical. Numerous
expressions of hope were voiced, as Khrushchev suggested and Kennedy repeated
that Russians and Americans could enter into some sort of cooperative space
program.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>The men of NASA, the Defense Department, and the aerospace industry viewed
the feat more prosaically. They realized something of its impact on mankind, but
most of their pride stemmed from the smooth-working demonstration of their space
hardware and the recovery forces in action. And their interest quickly returned
to the tasks of full exploitation of men and machines for Mercury.
<P>Those who in the past had been the targets of technical kibitzing, domestic
skepticism, and political pressure now were lauded by the American press for
having "stuck by their guns." Periodicals praised Hugh L. Dryden, Robert R.
Gilruth, Williams, Faget, Kraft, George M. Low, and Hartley A. Soul&eacute;, the
"leaders of this technical team who did their work on civil service pay and sold
no serial rights to national magazines. . . ."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>The MA-6 honors and celebrations consumed several days. Glenn, his family,
Vice-President Johnson, and the Mercury entourage passed in review on February
26 before an estimated 250,000 people lining rainy streets in Washington, after
which the astronaut gave a 20-minute informal report to a joint session of
Congress. New York City proclaimed March 1 "John Glenn Day," and Mayor Robert
Wagner presented medals to Glenn and Gilruth. The next day there was an informal
reception in honor of the orbiting American at United Nations Headquarters.
Glenn then journeyed to his home town, New Concord (population 2300), Ohio,
where about 75,000 greeted him on March 3.
<P>While everyone else feted Glenn, Mercury and contractor engineers at the Cape
subjected his spaceship to a minute examination. Except for the usual
discoloration, the interior and exterior of the capsule were in excellent
condition. In several places where there were separations between the shingles,
deposits of aluminum alloy had accumulated from the disintegration of the
retrorocket package during reentry. A brownish film of undetermined origin
covered the exterior surface of the window. Heatshield slices and cores showed
about the same minor char depth found after the MA-4 and MA-5 missions; the
center plug was sticking out about half an inch. There was also a wedge-shaped
darker area on the shield, striated by several radial marks about four inches
long, which the inspectors theorized was caused by the slipping retropack. [436]
The investigation team also found that the rotary switch that was to be actuated
by the heatshield deployment had a loose stem, causing the electrical contact to
break when the stem was moved up and down. This, they believed, accounted for
the false deploy signal that worried everyone so much during the flight.
Although there were several tears in the landing bag, caused either by impact or
retrieval handling, for the first time no cables or straps in the landing system
were broken. And while the lower pressure bulkhead again was slightly damaged,
the equipment there escaped harm.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>After this thorough postflight analysis, Glenn's spacecraft, McDonnell
capsule No. 13, went on a global tour, popularly known as the "fourth orbit of
<I>Friendship 7</I>." Literally millions of people stood patiently in line to
look inside the spacecraft as it was exhibited in 17 countries and Hawaii. By
August 1962 <I>Friendship 7</I> had reached the "Century 21 Exposition" at
Seattle. There, thousands more viewed the craft that had carried man on an
orbital journey through space. Finally, on the first anniversary of its voyage,
<I>Friendship 7</I> came officially to rest near the Wright Brothers' original
airplane and Lindbergh's <I>Spirit of St. Louis</I> in the Smithsonian
Institution.<A

<H3>Program Growth</H3>The dramatic series of events surrounding the MA-6
mission tended to obscure what was happening elsewhere in the national space
program. While Project Mercury finally was fulfilling its prime objective, NASA
picked the launch vehicle for its Apollo program. Headquarters announced on
January 9, 1962, that a "Super Saturn" (also known as "Advanced Saturn" and
"Saturn C-5") would be the Moon program rocket. The Saturn was then described as
being as tall as a 27-story building generating 7.5 million pounds of thrust in
its first stage, which would make it about 20 times more powerful than the
Atlas. On January 25, the Marshall Space Flight Center received orders from NASA
Headquarters to develop this booster that could support manned circumlunar
flights and manned lunar landings. The Saturn was to place 120 tons in low-Earth
orbit or send 45 tons of spacecraft toward the Moon. At the same time, the
public got its first view of drawings of the Apollo and Gemini spacecraft.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
<P>When the House Committee on Science and Astronautics opened its annual budget
hearings on February 27, 1962, among the first witnesses to testify were John
Glenn, Alan Shepard, and Virgil Grissom. Representative George P. Miller of
California, chairman of the committee, introduced the three as "men who have
been closest to the angels and still remain on Earth." All committee members
expressed their satisfaction with the management of Project Mercury, and they
reminded NASA that the agency was the committee's protege. Every tax dollar
required to make Project Mercury and the rest of the civilian space program a
success so far had resulted from the committee's study, approval, and
authorization.<A

<P>[438] After the astronauts had made brief statements and answered some
questions posed by the committee members, Administrator James E. Webb outlined
the NASA budget request for fiscal year 1963. The total NASA request was for
$3,787,276,000, of which $2.26 billion was earmarked for developing Gemini and
Apollo and for further exploration with Mercury in manned space flight. Robert
Gilruth testified about the Mercury portion of NASA's undertaking. By August
1962, when Congress passed the authorization bill, the NASA appropriation had
been pruned to $3,644,115,000. This reduction included $90 million from
research, development, and operational requests, and about $52.8 million asked
for construction of new facilities. But the total NASA money bill, coupled with
almost $1 billion that the Department of Defense received for its space
projects, meant that the Nation was going to spend almost $5 billion annually on
its space efforts.<A

<P>[440] Meanwhile the Manned Spacecraft Center had been undergoing rapid
changes, even though it was still located at the Langley Research Center pending
the move to Houston. On January 15, 1962, the Mercury Project Office was
established, reporting directly to Gilruth, together with the Gemini and Apollo
management offices. Kenneth S. Kleinknecht, a former leader in NASA's X-15
project and technical assistant on Gilruth's staff since January 11, 1960, was
picked to manage the completion of Mercury's program. Under its charter, the
Mercury Project Office was "responsible for the technical direction of the
McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and other industrial contractors assigned work on
the Mercury Project."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
<P>Project Office staffing and division of duties had been completed by the end
of January. Kleinknecht chose William Bland, who had been associated with
numerous engineering phases of the manned satellite enterprise since its
inception, as his deputy. The internal labor divisions of the Office were:
Project Engineering Office, Project Engineering Field Office (Cape), Engineering
Operations Office, and Engineering and Data Measurements Office. At the outset,
42 people worked in the Project Office primarily on scheduling, procurement, and
technical monitoring tasks. The similar management organizations set up for the
Gemini and Apollo programs had James A. Chamberlin (manager of Mercury until the
inception of Project Gemini) and Charles W. Frick as their managers,
respectively.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
<P>Moving MSC from tidewater Virginia to the Gulf Coast of Texas could have had
adverse effects on its staffing. Quite a number of the employees had long years
of service with NACA and its successor NASA, and had established deep personal
roots at Langley and around Hampton, Virginia. Now they would be uprooted and
transplanted some 1500 miles away in Texas. Many would face inconvenience and
monetary and personal losses resulting from the transfer. Stuart H. Clarke,
chief of the Personnel Office of MSC, polled the staff to determine how many
favored the move. Of 1152 employees, only 84 indicated that they would not go.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
Gilruth and Williams decided that while people, records, and equipment were
being transferred, the operational and Mercury Project Office activities should
remain at Langley to prevent the disruption of Project Mercury's flight
planning. This meant that management in Mercury would be directed from Langley
at least through Mercury-Atlas 7.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>

<H3>The Slayton Case</H3>Donald K. Slayton and Walter M. Schirra, pilot and
backup, respectively, for Mercury-Atlas 7, had been in training side by side
with Glenn and Carpenter since the team announcements were made after the MA-5
flight. On March 15, 1962, NASA announced that Slayton, because of an "erratic
heart rate," had been replaced by Carpenter as the pilot for MA-7. The
suddenness of this announcement surprised almost everyone, especially
journalists who had begun turning out "human interest" copy about Slayton. The
obvious question was: How could an astronaut, supposedly a perfect physical
specimen, develop, of all things, a heart condition? [441] The truth was that
Slayton had been under close medical surveillance for over two years, and he and
his fellow astronauts each knew how precarious a thing is perfect health.
<P>The astronauts' physician, William Douglas, recognized that Slayton had a
condition medically termed as idiopathic atrial fibrillation - occasional
irregularity of a muscle at the top of the heart, caused by unknown factors -
when the astronauts first rode the centrifuge in August 1959 at Johnsville.
Douglas noted Slayton was performing his tasks in magnificent fashion, but he
still thought it best to consult with the chief of cardiology service at the
Philadelphia Navy Hospital. The consultant assured Slayton and Douglas that the
condition was of no consequence and should not influence Slayton's eventual
choice as a flight astronaut. The astronaut's physician did not accept this
appraisal as a final diagnostic decision. He and Slayton visited the Air Force's
School of Aviation Medicine in San Antonio, Texas, where a member of the
internal medicine staff voiced the same opinion. Sometime later Douglas learned
that this individual wrote to Administrator James E. Webb, making a
recommendation that Slayton should not be assigned a flight.
<P>After sojourns at various medical centers, Douglas informed Mercury Director
Gilruth of Slayton's condition during the fall of 1959. Gilruth, in turn,
briefed NASA Headquarters in Washington. Douglas also relayed the information to
the Air Force Surgeon General's office and was advised to take no action. For
some time thereafter the "Slayton file" lay dormant. The astronaut was selected
as a pilot in November 1961 and began training for his flight.
<P>Shortly after the beginning of the new year, NASA Administrator Webb,
remembering the dissenting vote he had received from an Air Force physician,
and, mindful of the fact that Slayton was an Air Force officer on loan, directed
a complete reevaluation of the case. In response Douglas called together Stanley
White, William S. Augerson, and James P. Henry, physicians assigned to the
Mercury program, to study the matter in detail. Their considered recommendation
was that Slayton should continue as the pilot for MA-7. From MSC, Douglas
journeyed to Washington to brief Brigadier General Charles H. Roadman and
Colonel George M. Knauf, Chief and Deputy Chief of the Office of Space Medicine
in NASA Headquarters. These doctors also recommended that Slayton remain on
space flight status. The reopening of the case was brought to the attention of
the Air Force Surgeon General, who convened a board of eight flight surgeons to
review the matter. The MSC physician appeared before that body, presenting it
with every facet of the medical file. Slayton also appeared. The board judged
Slayton to be "fully qualified as an Air Force pilot and as an astronaut."
<P>Administrator Webb referred the case to a group of three nationally eminent
cardiologists - Proctor Harvey, professor of cardiology, Georgetown University;
Thomas Mattingly, heart specialist, Washington Hospital Center; and Eugene
Braunwall, National Institutes of Health. Their consensus was that they were
[442] unable to state conclusively whether Slayton's physiological performance
would be jeopardized by his heart condition. Because of this unknown, they felt
that if NASA had an available astronaut who did not "fibrillate," then he should
be used rather than Slayton. Braunwall added that if there was sufficient time
he would like to subject Slayton to some physiological tests.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
<P>Asked several years later if he had known about his heart condition when he
was chosen for Project Mercury, Slayton replied:<A
href="notes.htm#n13.63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No, I didn't, but in the examinations prior to the August 1959
  centrifuge program at AMAL the medics discovered that my heart skipped a beat
  now and then. I went ahead with the centrifuge runs and began to watch myself
  very closely, noticing that quite often after supper my pulse would be
  irregular. I would get out and run a mile and everything was normal again. I
  was terribly concerned over what in my diet might be causing it, but every
  hypothesis turned up wrong. Concern in STG and even NASA Headquarters got so
  great in 1960 that I was sent to all kinds of exhaustive examinations under
  the best heart specialists in the country - in Philadelphia, San Antonio, and
  New York City. I was examined by different groups of heart specialists who
  could find nothing wrong. Even Paul Dudley White, Ike's personal physician,
  gave me a clean bill of health but rendered an operational rather than a
  diagnostic decision, recommending that the unknown factor in my heart murmur
  not be added to all the other unknowns for manned space flight.</BLOCKQUOTE>The
Slayton decision was irrevocable, even though Gilruth and William Douglas
disagreed with the high-level medical verdict. Slayton, they felt, had withstood
greater stresses in the training program than he would have experienced had he
been rocketed into orbit. On the other hand, Administrator Webb, because of the
unknown elements, concurred with the cardiologists that it was neither safe nor
politic to subject an individual who had a heart condition, however slight, to
the stresses of orbital flight when there were other flight-trained astronauts
available.
<P>Shortly after the replacement, Douglas, having completed a three-year tour of
detached duty with NASA, returned to his career service, the Air Force. Some
newsmen were quick to conclude that this action suggested bitterness. They had
not known that Douglas had been invited to the medical hearings but had known
that Douglas had been outspoken in his opposition to Slayton's removal from
flight status. Stanley White denied the charge in a news conference, maintaining
that Douglas' return to the Air Force had been arranged for "better than six
months."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>
Of the original team of astronauts, Slayton had been considered the professional
test pilot par excellence, largely because of his overwhelming experience and
flight time. He soon became the coordinator of astronaut activities. He never
abandoned hope that he still might make a space flight. As late as December
1964, more than a year and a half after Project Mercury had completed its last
flight and when Project Gemini was nearing its first manned flight, the unlucky
astronaut remarked, "I've never been grounded and I'm not now. I still hope to
get my chance to go beyond the atmosphere."

<H3>MA-7 Preparations</H3>[443] One would have expected, in keeping with the
"backup" concept, that Schirra, the MA-7 alternate pilot, now would step in as
prime astronaut. But in view of the numerous delays and consequent lengthy
training preparations for MA-6, Williams, as the operations team leader,
recommended to Gilruth that Carpenter, Glenn's backup pilot, was most primed for
the upcoming mission. Carpenter had logged 79&frac12; hours of preflight checkout
and training time in Glenn's <I>Friendship 7</I>, more than twice the 31&frac12; hours
he would spend in his own <I>Aurora 7</I> for the same purposes.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.65"><SUP>65</SUP></A>
<P>Although Glenn's mission had been highly successful, the Mercury operations
team was still in the learning process. Experience with a component in the
Mercury capsule or a flight procedure during the MA-6 orbital flight served to
guide MA-7 mission planning. Glenn had shown that man definitely could be more
than just a passenger, so the MSC planners adjusted the MA-7 flight plan to
allow more pilot control of the mission. Combined yaw-roll maneuvers were
scheduled to permit observation of the sunrise, as well as maneuvers to
determine the use of day and night horizons, landmarks, and stars as navigation
references. One of the more interesting planned innovations for Carpenter's
voyage involved a period of inverted flight (head toward Earth) to determine the
effect of Earth-up and sky-down on pilot orientation. Flight planners recognized
the need for perceptual reorientation in space flight as well as for the motor
skills that had been demonstrated so well by Glenn. The next Mercury mission
ought to be as much of a scientific experiment as possible, not only to
corroborate MA-6 but also to explore new possibilities with the manned Mercury
spacecraft.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.66"><SUP>66</SUP></A>
<P>Since Glenn had been able to respond to many of the scientific astronomical
observation requests, Homer Newell, who had been Director of NASA's Office of
Space Sciences since November 1, 1961, decided that the direction of the
scientific portion of the manned space flight program should now become the
responsibility of a formal committee. Jocelyn Gill again was chosen to serve as
chairman of a group called the Ad Hoc Committee on Scientific Tasks and Training
for Man-in-Space. Two days after receiving the mandate, Dr. Gill called a
meeting of members, consisting of representatives from the various scientific
disciplines, on March 16, 1962, to outline objectives, review past activities in
this respect, present a preliminary analysis of the scientific debriefing of
Glenn, and outline tasks and goals for the next meeting. One of the aims of the
new committee was to devise a curriculum that would provide the astronauts with
the best informational sources available about the spatial phenomena they might
see. In addition to this, they proceeded to suggest several experiments to the
Manned Spacecraft Center.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.67"><SUP>67</SUP></A>
<P>So without jeopardizing either pilot safety or mission success, the MA-7
flight would be designed to yield as much scientific, as opposed to engineering,
information as possible. Kleinknecht, head of the MSC Mercury Project Office,
[444] named Lewis R. Fisher chairman of the Mercury Scientific Experiments
Panel, as a parallel to the NASA Headquarters unit, to manage and arrange for
the experiments being suggested. Fisher and his associates were charged with
reviewing all proposed experiments from an engineering feasibility standpoint in
terms of their scientific value, relative priority, and suitability for orbital
flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.68"><SUP>68</SUP></A>
<P>The Fisher panel first met at Cape Canaveral on April 24, 1962, and decided
to emphasize five suggested experiments: releasing a multi-colored balloon that
would remain tethered to the capsule, observing the behavior of liquid in a
weightless state inside a closed glass bottle, using a special light meter to
determine the visibility of a ground flare, making weather photographs with
hand-held cameras, and studying the airglow layer - for which Carpenter would
receive special training. The tethered balloon was a 30-inch mylar inflatable
sphere, which was folded, packaged, and housed with its gas expansion bottle in
the antenna canister. The whole balloon package weighed two pounds. Divided into
five sections of different colors - uncolored aluminum, yellow, orange, white,
and a phosphorescent coating that appeared white by day and blue by night - the
balloon was to be cast off near perigee after the first orbital pass to float
freely at the end of a 100-foot nylon line. The purposes of the balloon
experiment were to study the effects of space on the reflection properties of
colored surfaces through visual observation and photographic studies and to
obtain aerodynamic drag measurements by use of a strain gauge.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.69"><SUP>69</SUP></A>
<P>Some experimentation on the effects of reduced gravity on liquids previously
had been conducted at Holloman Air Force Base, at the Air Force School of
Aviation Medicine in San Antonio, and at the Lewis Research Center. But the
duration of these experiments, involving parabolic airplane flights and
drop-tower tests, had been necessarily short. Results of an extended study would
have both immediate and long-range implications in manned space flight
operations. Already the problem of gas or fuel vapor ullage in space vehicles
and in storage tanks was causing some difficulties, and later there would be
related problems in orbital rendezvous fuel transfer. Before fuel tanks and
pumps for extended use in space could be designed, the behavior of surface
tension and capillary action of liquids in the weightless state had to be
determined. For this experiment the Lewis Center provided a small glass sphere
containing a capillary tube with tiny semicircular holes at the bottom of the
open tube. The sphere, only 20 percent filled, contained 60 milliliters of a
mixture of distilled water, green dye, aerosol solution, and silicone. The
liquid had a surface tension of 32 dynes per centimeter on Earth.
<P>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology requested photographs of the
daylight horizon through blue and red filters to define more precisely the
Earth-horizon limb as seen from above the atmosphere. These findings would be
particularly valuable for navigation studies in the Apollo program. The Weather
Bureau wanted information on the best wavelengths for meteorological satellite
photography. John A. O'Keefe and Jocelyn Gill at the Goddard Space Flight Center
[445] and NASA Headquarters, respectively, wanted a distance measurement of the
airglow layer above the horizon, its angular width, and a description of its
characteristics, and for this experiment Carpenter was provided with a
photometer and trained to use it. Paul D. Lowman, also of Goddard, requested
special photography of the North American and African land masses. Lowman's
interest was based on his studies of planetary surfaces, particularly regarding
meteoroid impact features.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.70"><SUP>70</SUP></A>
<P>A number of technical changes based on MA-6 mission results were made for
MA-7, mostly involving deletions of certain equipment from the spacecraft to
reduce weight. Kleinknecht's office eliminated the sofar bombs and radar chaff
recovery aids, which seemed unnecessary in view of the effectiveness that had
been demonstrated by the sarah beacon and dye markers. Other deletions included
the knee and chest straps on the couch, which had bothered Grissom; the red
filter in the window; the moderately heavy Earth-path indicator; and the
instrument panel camera, which had already gathered sufficient data.
<P>Modifications made to improve spacecraft, network, and astronaut performance
included a radio frequency change in the telemetry system to eradicate
transmission interference like that experienced on Glenn's flight. The two
landing-bag switches were rewired so that both had to be closed to activate the
deploy signal. To correct temporarily the control problem experienced by Glenn,
Karl F. Greil of the Mercury Project Office studied masses of data and concluded
that the problem lay in the fuel line filters. So the dutch-weave filters in the
fuel lines were replaced with platinum screens, and a stainless-steel fuel line
was substituted. This was intended as an "interim fix," but it became permanent
in the Mercury project for the later flights. Even the astronaut's attire
underwent some modifications. Pockets were added on the upper sleeves and on the
lower legs of the pressure suit for pencils, a handkerchief, and other small
accessories. And the waterwing life vest, first carried by Glenn, was installed
on the chest beneath the parabolic mirror. To add to Carpenter's comfort while
he was waiting in his capsule on the launch pad, a new and more resilient liner
was fitted in the couch.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.71"><SUP>71</SUP></A>
<P>The three principal components of the MA-7 mission - spacecraft, launch
rocket, and astronaut - were in preparation for several months. Spacecraft No.
18 was the first of these to reach the Cape, arriving on November 15, 1961.
During its long checkout period by G. Merritt Preston's crew, this vehicle was
reworked twice to incorporate lessons learned during MA-5 and MA-6. Some
equipment and systems in the capsule had to be exchanged because what it had
carried to Florida simply did not work properly. The original periscope, for
example, failed to latch in the retracted position. Glenn's drogue parachute
mortar supposedly had fired before the pilot triggered its button; the McDonnell
engineers decided that a barostat in the recovery arming circuit should prevent
another premature action. Since there still were questions concerning the
temperature at different places on the capsule while it was in orbit, a device
known as a [446] "low-level commutator" was added, and temperature pickups were
strategically located at 28 points on the spacecraft to record temperature data
on a tape recorder carried on board.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.72"><SUP>72</SUP></A>
<P>When in March he learned that he would fly spacecraft No. 18, Scott Carpenter
named his capsule <I>Aurora 7</I>. He chose this name deliberately, "Because I
think of Project Mercury and the open manner in which we are conducting it for
the benefit of all as a light in the sky. Aurora also means dawn - in this case
the dawn of a new age. The 7, of course, stands for the original seven
astronauts." Coincidentally, the astronaut as a boy had lived at the corner of
Aurora and Seventh Avenues in Boulder, Colorado.
<P>The Atlas, the astronaut, and the ground support personnel entered into their
final preparatory phase in March 1962. On March 8, six days after the Air Force
accepted it at the rollout inspection at the Convair factory in San Diego, Atlas
107-D arrived at the Cape and was erected on the pad. Since the previous Atlas
had performed well in boosting Glenn into orbit and since the MA-7 launch
requirements were to duplicate those of MA-6, few changes were necessary for
107-D. One alteration was a slight reduction in the staging time, from 131.3 to
130.1 seconds after liftoff, to improve the launch vehicle's ability to reach
the precise center of the insertion "window."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.73"><SUP>73</SUP></A>
Intensive training for the astronaut, his backup, and the tracking teams on the
MA-7 mission began on March 16. Mission simulations, flight controller training,
and an exercise of the Defense Department recovery forces proceeded much as they
had for MA-6. The Atlantic tracking ship, however, was not on station for MA-7
because she was at a Baltimore shipyard, being converted into a command ship to
support the longer-duration Mercury missions.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.74"><SUP>74</SUP></A>
<P>At the time of Glenn's flight, the launch of MA-7 had been scheduled for the
second week in April, but the installation of new components, such as the
temperature survey instrumentation and the barostat in the drogue parachute
circuit, as well as other work, delayed the launching until May. Also
contributing to the postponement was an Atlantic Fleet tactical exercise that
required participation by the recovery ships and aircraft for several weeks. The
week beginning May 20 looked the most feasible for sending a second American
into orbit.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.75"><SUP>75</SUP></A>

<H3>Flight of <I>Aurora 7</I></H3>At 1:15 a.m., May 24, 1962, Scott Carpenter
was awakened in his quarters in Hangar S at Cape Canaveral. He ate a breakfast
of filet mignon, poached eggs, strained orange juice, toast, and coffee,
prepared by his dietitian. During the next hour, starting about 2:15 a.m., he
had a physical examination and stood patiently in his underwear as the sensors
were attached at various spots on his lean body, and by 3:25 he had donned his
silver suit and had it checked. Everything had gone so smoothly that Carpenter
had time to relax in a contour chair while waiting to board the van.
<P>[447] At 3:45, Carpenter and his retinue, including Joe Schmitt and John
Glenn, marched from the hangar and climbed aboard the vehicle for a slow ride to
Pad 14, where <I>Aurora 7</I> sat atop the Atlas. Again there was a pause,
during which a Weather Bureau representative presented a briefing to the
astronaut-of-the-day, predicting a dispersal of the ground fog then hovering
around the launch site. Finally, at 4:35, Carpenter received word from Mercury
Control to ascend the gantry. Just before he boarded the elevator he stopped to
swap greetings with and to thank the flight support crewmen. After the final
checks in the gantry white room, the astronaut crawled into the capsule and got
settled with only minor difficulties, and soon the capsule crew was bolting the
hatch. This time all 70 bolts were aligned properly.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.76"><SUP>76</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile the booster countdown was racing along. Christopher Kraft recalled
that the countdown was "as near perfect as could be hoped for." The only thing
complicating the prelaunch sequence was the persistent ground fog and broken
cloudiness at dawn. Strapped in the contour couch, and finding the new couch
liner comfortable, Carpenter was busy verifying his preflight checklist. Just 11
minutes before the scheduled launch time, the operations team decided that
adequate camera coverage was not yet possible, and three consecutive 15-minute
holds were called. Although Carpenter felt that he could continue in a hold
status indefinitely, he was thirsty and drank some cold tea from his squeeze
bottle supply. During the holds he talked with his wife Rene and their four
children at the Cape, assuring them that all was well.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.77"><SUP>77</SUP></A>
<P>The rising sun rapidly dispelled the ground fog. Then at 7:45 a.m., after the
smoothest countdown of an American manned space mission to date, Mercury-Atlas
7, bearing <I>Aurora 7</I>, rose majestically off the pad while some 40 million
people watched by television.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.78"><SUP>78</SUP></A>
<P>Kraft, the flight director, described the powered phase of the flight as so
"excellent" that the decision to "go-for-mission" was almost routine.
Seventy-three seconds from launch, the booster's radio inertial guidance system
locked on and directed the flight from staging until T plus 5:38 minutes.
Actually this amounted to some 28 seconds after the Atlas sustainer engine had
died, but no guidance inputs were possible after engine shutdown. Carpenter
tried using the parabolic mirror on his chest to watch the booster's
programming, but he could see only a reflection of the pitch attitude. At about
35,000 feet he noticed out his window a contrail, and then an airplane producing
another contrail. The sky began to darken; it was not yet black, but it was no
longer a light blue.
<P>The booster performed much more quietly than Carpenter had expected from all
its awesome power. Vibration had been slight at liftoff. Booster engine cutoff
was smooth and gentle, but a few seconds later the noise accompanying maximum
aerodynamic stress began to build up. A wisp of smoke that appeared out the
window gave Carpenter the impression that the escape tower had jettisoned, but a
glance showed that it was still there. Shortly thereafter, when the tower did
separate from the capsule, Carpenter "felt a bigger jolt than at staging." [448]
He watched the tower cartwheel lazily toward the horizon, smoke trailing from
its three rocket nozzles.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.79"><SUP>79</SUP></A>
<P>Sustainer engine cutoff came only as a gentle drop in acceleration. Two bangs
were cues that the clamp-ring explosive bolts had fired and that the posigrade
rockets had propelled the spacecraft clear of the booster. Now <I>Aurora 7</I>
was on its own and in space. Becoming immediately aware that he was weightless,
Carpenter elatedly reported that zero g was pleasant. Just as the capsule and
booster separated, the astronaut had noticed that the capillary tube in his
liquid-test apparatus seemed to fill. Then he averted his gaze; it was time to
turn the spacecraft around to its normal backward flying orbital attitude. Since
Glenn had left this maneuver to the automatic control system and the cost in
fuel had been high, Carpenter used fly-by-wire. The spacecraft came smartly
around at an expense of only 1.6 pounds of fuel, compared with over 5 pounds
used on Glenn's MA-6 maneuver.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.80"><SUP>80</SUP></A>
<P>As the capsule swung around from antenna-canister-forward to
heatshield-forward, Carpenter was impressed by the fact that he felt absolutely
no angular motion; his instruments provided the only evidence that the
turnaround maneuver was being executed. Like Glenn, he was amazed that he felt
no sensation of speed, although he knew he was traveling at orbital velocity
(actually 17,549 miles per hour). Soon he had his first awe-inspiring view of
the horizon - "an arresting sight," as he described it. Quickly checking his
control systems, he found everything in order. Unknown to him, however, the
horizon scanner optically sensing his spacecraft's pitch attitude was off by
about 20 degrees. It was some time before he deduced this system was in error.
<P>As Glenn had done, Carpenter peered out the window to track the spent Atlas
sustainer engine. The tankage appeared to fall downward, as the engineers had
predicted, and was tumbling away slowly. A trail of ice crystals two or three
times longer than the launch vehicle streamed from its nozzle. Over the Canary
Islands, Carpenter still could see the sustainer tagging along below the
spacecraft. Meanwhile the astronaut continued to check the capsule systems and
report his findings to the tracking sites. Over Kano, in mid-Nigeria, he said
that he was getting behind in his flight plan because of difficulty in loading
his camera with the special film to photograph the Earth-horizon limb. Before he
moved beyond radio range of Kano, however, he managed to snap a few photographs.
Although it was now almost dusk on his first "45-minute day," Carpenter was
becoming increasingly warm and began adjusting his suit-temperature knob.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.81"><SUP>81</SUP></A>
<P>Over the Indian Ocean on his first pass, Carpenter glanced down for a view
through the periscope, which he found to be quite ineffective on the dark side
of Earth. Concluding that the periscope seemed to be useless at night, he
returned to the window for visual references. Even when the gyros were caged and
he was not exactly sure of his attitude position, he felt absolutely no
sensation of disorientation; it was a simple matter in the daylight to roll the
spacecraft over and watch for a landmark to pop into view. Carpenter mentioned
many recognizable landmarks, [449] such as Lake Chad, Africa, the rain forests
of that continent, and Madagascar. But he was a little surprised to find out
that most of Earth when seen from orbit is covered by clouds the greater part of
the time.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.82"><SUP>82</SUP></A>
<P>While over the Indian Ocean, Carpenter discovered that his celestial
observations were hampered by glare from light seepage around the satellite
clock inside the capsule. The light from the rim of the clock, which should
presumably have been screened, made it hard for him to adjust his eyes to night
vision. To Slayton at the Muchea station, Carpenter reported that he could see
no more stars from his vantage point in space than he could have seen on Earth.
Also he said that the stars were not particularly useful in gaining heading
information.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.83"><SUP>83</SUP></A>
<P>Like his orbital predecessor, Carpenter failed to see the star-shell flares
fired in an observation experiment. This time the flares shot up from the Great
Victoria Desert near Woomera, Australia, rather than from the Indian Ocean ship.
According to the plan, four flares of one-million candlepower were to be
launched for Carpenter's benefit on his first orbit, and three more each on his
second and third passes. On the first try the flares, each having a burning time
of 1&frac12; minutes, were ignited at 60-second intervals. At this time most of the
Woomera area was covered by clouds that hid the illumination of the flares; the
astronaut consequently saw nothing and the experiment was discontinued on the
succeeding two passes, as weather conditions did not improve.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.84"><SUP>84</SUP></A>
<P>Out over the Pacific on its first circuit, <I>Aurora 7</I> performed nicely.
The Canton Island station received the telemetered body temperature reading of
102 degrees and asked Carpenter if he was uncomfortable at that temperature.
"No, I don't believe that's correct," Carpenter replied. "I can't imagine I'm
that hot. I'm quite comfortable, but sweating some." The medical monitors
accepted Carpenter's self-assessment and concluded that the feverish temperature
reading resulted from an error in the equipment. For the rest of the journey,
however, the elevated temperatures persisted, causing the various communicators
to ask frequently about Carpenter's physical status.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.85"><SUP>85</SUP></A>
<P>The food Carpenter carried on his voyage was different from Glenn's which was
of the squeeze-tube, baby-food variety. For Carpenter the Pillsbury Company had
prepared three kinds of snacks, composed of chocolate, figs, and dates with
high-protein cereals; and the Nestl&eacute; Company had provided some "bonbons,"
composed of orange peel with almonds, high-protein cereals with almonds, and
cereals with raisins. These foods were processed into particles about
three-fourths of an inch square. Coated with an edible glaze, each piece was
packaged separately and stored in an opaque plastic bag. As he passed over
Canton he reported that he had eaten one bite of the inflight food, which was
crumbling badly. Weightless crumbs drifting around in the cabin were not only
bothersome but also potentially dangerous to his breathing. Though he had been
able to eat one piece, his gloved hands made it awkward to get the food to his
mouth around the helmet microphones.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.86"><SUP>86</SUP></A>
Once in his mouth, however, the food was tasty enough and easy enough to eat.
<P>[450] During the second orbit, as he had on the first, Carpenter made
frequent capsule maneuvers with the fly-by-wire and manual-proportional modes of
attitude control. He slewed his ship around to make photographs; he pitched the
capsule down 80 degrees in case the ground flares were fired over Woomera; he
yawed around to observe and photograph the airglow phenomenon; and he rolled the
capsule until Earth was "up" for the inverted flight experiment. Carpenter even
stood the capsule on its antenna canister and found that the view was
exhilarating. Although the manual control system worked well, the MA-7 pilot had
some difficulty caging the attitude gyros to zero before inverting the
spacecraft. On two occasions he had to recycle the caging operation after the
gyros tumbled beyond their responsive limits.
<P>Working under his crowded experiment schedule and the heavy manual maneuver
program, on six occasions Carpenter accidentally actuated the
sensitive-to-the-touch, high-thrust attitude control jets, which brought about
"double authority control," or the redundant operation of both the automatic and
the manual systems. So by the end of the first two orbits Carpenter's control
fuel supply had dipped to about 42 percent in the manual tanks and 45 percent in
the automatic tanks. During his second orbit, ground capsule communicators at
various tracking sites repeatedly reminded him to conserve his fuel.
<P>Although his fuel usage was high during the second circumnavigation,
Carpenter still managed to continue the experiments. Just as he passed over the
Cape, for example, an hour and 38 minutes from launch, Carpenter deployed the
multicolored balloon. For a few seconds he saw the confetti spray, signaling
deployment. Then, as the line lazily played out, he realized that the balloon
had not inflated properly; only two of the five colors - orange and dull
aluminum - were visible, the orange clearly the more brilliant. Two small,
earlike appendages about six to eight inches each, described as "sausages,"
emerged on the sides of the partially inflated sphere. The movement of the
half-inflated balloon was erratic and unpredictable, but Carpenter managed to
obtain a few drag resistance measurements. A little more than a half hour after
the balloon was launched, Carpenter began some spacecraft maneuvers and the
tether line twined to some extent about the capsule's antenna canister.
Carpenter wanted to get rid of the balloon and attempted to release it going
into the third orbit over the Cape, but the partially successful experimental
device stayed doggedly near the spacecraft.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.87"><SUP>87</SUP></A>
<P>As Carpenter entered the last orbit, both his automatic and manual control
fuel tanks were less than half full. So <I>Aurora 7</I> began a long period of
drifting flight. Short recess periods to conserve fuel had occurred earlier in
the flight, but now Carpenter and his ship were to drift in orbit almost around
the world. Although his rapidly depleting fuel supply had made the drift a
necessity, this vehicle control relaxation maneuver, if successful, would be a
valuable engineering experiment. The results would be most useful in planning
the rest and sleep periods for an astronaut on a longer Mercury mission.
Carpenter enjoyed his floating orbit, observing that it was a simple matter to
start a roll rate of [452] perhaps one degree per second and let the capsule
slowly revolve as long as desired. <I>Aurora 7</I> drifted gracefully through
space for more than an hour, or almost until retrofire time.

<P>While in his drifting flight, Carpenter used the Moon to check his capsule's
attitude. John Glenn had reported some difficulty in obtaining and holding an
absolute zero-degree heading. Carpenter, noting that the Moon appeared almost in
the center of his window, oriented the spacecraft so that it held the Moon on
the exact center mark and maintained the position with ease.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.88"><SUP>88</SUP></A>
<P>During the third orbital pass, Carpenter caught on film the phenomenon of the
flattened Sun at sunset. John O'Keefe and his fellow scientists at Goddard had
taught Carpenter that the color layers at sunset might provide information on
light transfusion characteristics of the upper atmosphere. Carpenter furnished a
vivid description of the sunset to the capsule communicator on the Indian Ocean
ship:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The sunsets are most spectacular. The earth is black after the sun
  has set. . . . The first band close to the earth is red, the next is yellow,
  the next is blue, the next is green, and the next is sort of a - sort of a
  purple. It's almost like a very brilliant rainbow. These layers extend from at
  least 90 degrees either side of the sun at sunset. This bright horizon band
  extended at least 90 degrees north and south of the position at
sunset.</BLOCKQUOTE>He took some 19 pictures of the flattened Sun.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.89"><SUP>89</SUP></A>
<P>As Carpenter drifted over oceans and land masses, he observed and reported on
the haze layer, or airglow phenomenon, about which Glenn had marveled.
Carpenter's brief moments of airglow study during the second orbit failed to
match the expectations he had derived from Glenn's reports and the Goddard
scientists' predictions on the phenomenon. Having more leisure on his third
circuit, Carpenter described the airglow layer in detail to Slayton at the
Muchea tracking site:
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . . the haze layer is very bright. I would say about 8 to 10
  degrees above the real horizon. And I would say that the haze layer is about
  twice as high above the horizon as the bright blue band at sunset is; it's
  twice as thick. A star - stars are occluded as we pass through this haze
  layer. I have a good set of stars to watch going through at this time. I'll
  try to get some photometer readings. . . . It is not twice as thick. It's
  thinner, but it is located at a distance about twice as far away as the top of
  the band at sunset. It's very narrow, and as bright as the horizon of the
  earth itself.</BLOCKQUOTE>The single star, not stars, that Carpenter tracked was
Phecda Ursae Majoris, in the Big Dipper or Great Bear constellation, with a
magnitude of 2.5.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.90"><SUP>90</SUP></A>
<P>With each sunrise, Carpenter also saw the "fireflies," or "Glenn effect," as
the Russians were calling it. To him the particles looked more like snowflakes
than fireflies, and they did not seem to be truly luminous, as Glenn had said.
The particles varied in size, brightness, and color. Some were gray, some were
white, and one in particular, said Carpenter, looked like a helical shaving from
a lathe. Although they seemed to travel at different speeds, they did not move
out and away [453] from the spacecraft as the confetti had in the balloon
experiment.
<P>At dawn on the third pass Carpenter reached for a device known as a
densitometer, that measured light intensity. Accidentally his gloved hand bumped
against the capsule hatch, and suddenly a cloud of particles flew past the
window. He yawed right to investigate, noting that the particles traveled across
the front of the window from right to left. Another tap of the hand on the hatch
sent off a second shower; a tap on the wall produced another. Since the exterior
of the spacecraft evidently was covered with frost, Glenn's "fireflies" became
Carpenter's "frostflies."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.91"><SUP>91</SUP></A>
<P>Until <I>Aurora 7</I> reached the communication range of the Hawaiian station
on the third pass, Christopher Kraft, directing the flight from the Florida
control center, considered this mission the most successful to date; everything
had gone perfectly except for some overexpenditure of hydrogen peroxide fuel.
Carpenter had exercised his manual controls with ease in a number of spacecraft
maneuvers and had made numerous and valuable observations in the interest of
space science. Even though the control fuel usage had been excessive in the
first two orbits, by the time he drifted near Hawaii on the third pass Carpenter
had successfully maintained more than 40 percent of his fuel in both the
automatic and the manual tanks. According to the mission rules, this ought to be
quite enough hydrogen peroxide, reckoned Kraft, to thrust the capsule into the
retrofire attitude, hold it, and then to reenter the atmosphere using either the
automatic or the manual control system.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.92"><SUP>92</SUP></A>
<P>The tracking site at Hawaii instructed Carpenter to start his preretrofire
countdown and to shift from manual control to the automatic stabilization and
control system. He explained to the ground station over which he was passing at
five miles per second that he had gotten somewhat behind on the preretro
checkoff list while verifying his hypothesis about the snowflake-like particles
outside his window. Then as Carpenter began aligning the spacecraft and shifting
control to the automatic mode, he suddenly found himself to be in trouble. The
automatic stabilization system would not hold the 34-degree pitch and
zero-degree yaw attitude. As he tried to determine what was wrong, he fell
behind in his check of other items. When he hurriedly switched to the
fly-by-wire control mode, he forgot to switch off the manual system. For about
10 minutes fuel from both systems was being used redundantly.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.93"><SUP>93</SUP></A>
<P>Finally, Carpenter felt that he had managed to align the spacecraft for the
retrofire sequence. The Hawaiian communicator urged him to complete as much of
the checklist as possible before he passed out of that site's communications
range. Now Alan Shepard's voice from the Arguello, California, station came in
loud and clear, asking whether the <I>Aurora 7</I> pilot had bypassed the
automatic retroattitude switch. Carpenter quickly acted on this timely reminder.
Then the countdown for retrofire began. Because the automatic system was
misbehaving, Carpenter was to push the button to ignite the solid-fuel
retrorockets strapped to the heatshield. About three seconds after Shepard's
call of "Mark! Fire One," the first [454] rocket ignited and blew. Then the
second and the third followed in reassuring succession. Carpenter saw wisps of
smoke inside his cabin as the rockets braked him out of orbit.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.94"><SUP>94</SUP></A>
<P>Carpenter's attitude error was more than he estimated when he reported his
attitude nearly correct. Actually <I>Aurora 7</I> was canted at retrofire about
25 degrees to the right, and thus the reverse thrust vector was not in line with
the flight path vector. This misalignment alone would have caused the spacecraft
to overshoot the planned impact point by about 175 miles. But the retrorockets
began firing three seconds late, adding another 15 miles or so to the trajectory
error. Later analyses also revealed a thrust decrement in the retrorockets that
was about three percent below nominal, contributing 60 more miles to the
overshoot. If Carpenter had not bypassed the automatic retroattitude switch and
manually ignited the retrorockets he could have overshot his pickup point in the
Atlantic by an even greater distance.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.95"><SUP>95</SUP></A>
<P>Unlike Glenn, Carpenter had no illusion that he was being driven back to
Hawaii at retrofire. Instead he had the feeling that <I>Aurora 7</I> had simply
stopped and that if he looked toward Earth he would see it coming straight up.
One glance out the window, however, and the "impression was washed away."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.96"><SUP>96</SUP></A>
The completion of retrofire produced no changes the pilot could feel until his
reentry began in earnest about 10 minutes later.
<P>After the retrorockets had fired, Carpenter realized that the manual control
system was still on. Quickly he turned off the fly-by-wire system, intending to
check the manual controls. Although the manual fuel gauge read six percent left,
there was, in fact, no fuel and consequently no manual control. So Carpenter
switched back to fly-by-wire. At that time the automatic system supply read 15
percent, but the astronaut wondered how much really remained. Could it be only
about 10 percent? With this gnawing doubt and realizing that it was still 10
minutes before .05-g time, Carpenter kept hands strictly off for most of his
drifting glide. Whatever fuel there was left must be saved for the critical
tumble. This 10-minute interval seemed like eternity to the pilot. The attitude
indicators appeared to be useless, and there was little fuel to control attitude
anyway. The only thing he trusted for reference was the view out of the window;
using fly-by-wire sparingly he tried to keep the horizon in view. Although
concerned about the fuel conservation problem, Carpenter gained some momentary
relief from the fascinating vistas below: "I can make out very, very small -
farm land, pasture land below. I see individual fields, rivers, lakes, roads, I
think. I'll get back to reentry attitude."<A
href="notes.htm#n13.97"><SUP>97</SUP></A>
<P>Finally, <I>Aurora 7</I> reached the .05-g acceleration point about 500 miles
off the coast of Florida. As he began to feel his weight once again, Carpenter
noted that the automatic fuel needle still read 15 percent. Within seconds the
capsule began to oscillate badly. A quick switch to the auxiliary damping mode
steadied the spacecraft. Grissom, the Cape communicator, reminded him to close
his faceplate.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.98"><SUP>98</SUP></A>
<P>[455] <I>Aurora 7</I> was now in the midst of its blazing return to Earth.
Carpenter heard the hissing sounds reported by Glenn, the cues that his ship was
running into aerodynamic resistance. Immediately the capsule began to roll
slowly, as programmed, to minimize the landing point dispersion. Carpenter
looked out the window for the bright orange glow, the "fireball," as Glenn had
described it, but there was only a moderate increase in light intensity. Rather
than an orange glow, Carpenter saw a light-green glow apparently surrounding the
cylindrical section. Was this radiant portion of the spacecraft ablating? Was
the trim angle correct? The evenness of the oscillations argued to Carpenter
that the trim angle was good. All the way through this zone Carpenter kept
talking. Gradually it became difficult to squeeze the words out; the heaviest
deceleration load was coming. The peak g period lasted longer than he had
expected, and it took forceful breath control to utter anything.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.99"><SUP>99</SUP></A>
<P>The automatic fuel tank on <I>Aurora 7</I> was emptied between 80,000 and
70,000 feet. As the plasma sheath of ionized air enveloped his spacecraft,
communication efforts with Carpenter became useless, but the telemetered signals
received by the radar stations at the Cape and on San Salvador predicted a
successful reentry. The oscillations were increasing as the capsule approached
the 50,000-foot level. <I>Aurora 7</I> was swinging beyond the 10-degree
"tolerable" limits. Carpenter strained upward to arm the drogue at 45,000 feet,
but he forced himself to ride out still more severe oscillations before he fired
the drogue parachute mortar at 25,000 feet. The chute pulsed out and vibrated
like thin, quivering sheets of metal. At 15,000 feet Carpenter armed the main
parachute switch, and at 9500 feet he deployed the chute manually. The fabric
quivered, but the giant umbrella streamed, reefed, and unfurled as it should.
The rate of descent was 30 feet per second, the exact design specification. The
spacecraft landing bag deploy was on automatic. Carpenter listened for the
"clunk," heard the heatshield fall into position, and waited to hit the water.
<I>Aurora 7</I> seemed to be ready for the landing, and the recovery forces knew
within a few miles the location of the spacecraft as radar tracking after
retrofire had given and confirmed the landing point.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.100"><SUP>100</SUP></A>
<P>Splashdown was noisy but less of a jolt than the spaceman had expected. The
capsule, however, did not right itself within a minute as it was supposed to do.
Carpenter, noticing some drops of water on his tape recorder, wondered if
<I>Aurora 7</I> was about to meet the fate of <I>Liberty Bell 7</I>, and then
sighed in relief when he could find no evidence of a leak. He waited a little
longer for the spacecraft to straighten up, but it continued to list to his
left. Grissom's last transmission from Mercury Control had told Carpenter that
it would take the pararescue men about an hour to reach him, and the astronaut
realized that he had evidently overshot the planned landing zone. When he failed
to raise a response on his radio, he decided to get out of the cramped capsule.
Then he saw that the capsule was floating rather deeply, which meant that it
might be dangerous to remove the hatch. Sweating profusely in the 101-degree
temperature of the cabin, he pulled off his helmet and began the job of egress
as it had been originally planned. [456] Carpenter wormed his way upward through
the throat of the spacecraft, a hard, hot job made bearable by his leaving the
suit circuit hose attached and not unrolling the neck dam. He struggled with the
camera, packaged life raft, survival kit, and kinky hose before he finally got
his head outside.
<P>Half out of the top hatch, Carpenter rested on his elbows momentarily,
released the suit hose but failed to deploy the neck dam and lock the hose
inlet, and surveyed the sea. Lazy swells, some as high as six feet, did not look
too forbidding. So he carefully laid his hand camera on top of the recovery
compartment, squeezed out of the top, and carefully lowered himself into the
water, tipping the listing spacecraft slightly in the process. Holding onto the
capsule, he was able to easily inflate the life raft - upside down. By this
time, feeling some water in his boots, he secured the hose inlet to the suit. He
then held on to the spacecraft's side and managed to flip the raft upright.
After crawling onto the yellow raft, he retrieved the camera, unrolled the suit
neck dam, and prepared to wait for as long as it took the recovery searchers to
find him. The recovery beacon was operating and the green dye pervaded the sea
all around him.<A

<P>The status of Carpenter and <I>Aurora 7</I> was unknown to the public.
Everyone following the flight by radio or television knew that the spacecraft
must be down. But was the pilot safe? What the public did not know was that one
P2V airplane had received the spacecraft's beacon signal from a distance of only
50 miles, while another plane had picked up the signal from 250 miles. <I>Aurora
7</I>'s position was well known to the recovery forces in the area. About eight
minutes before the spacecraft landed, an SA-16 seaplane of the Air Force Air
Rescue Service had taken off from Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, for the
radar-predicted landing point. Three ships - a Coast Guard cutter at St. Thomas
Island, a merchantman 31 miles from the plotted point, and the destroyer
<I>Farragut</I> about 75 miles away to the southwest - were in the vicinity of
the impact point. But it would certainly take longer than an hour for any
recovery unit to reach the site. Since Carpenter's raft had no radio, the drama
was heightened. What exactly had happened to Carpenter after his landing was
known only to the astronaut and perhaps to a few sea gulls and sea bass.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.102"><SUP>102</SUP></A>
<P>Carpenter settled down on his raft and waited patiently for his rescuers. He
mused over some seaweed floating nearby and "a black fish that was just as
friendly as he could be - right down by the raft." In time, 36 minutes after
splashdown, he saw two aircraft, a P2V and, unexpectedly, a Piper Apache. The
astronaut watched the planes circle, saw that the Apache pilot was photographing
the area, and knew that he had been found. Twenty minutes later several SC-54
aircraft arrived, and one dropped two frogmen, but Carpenter, watching other
planes, did not see them bail out.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.103"><SUP>103</SUP></A>
<P>Airman First Class John F. Heitsch, dropping from the SC-54 transport about
an hour and seven minutes after Carpenter had first hit the water, missed the
life raft by a considerable distance. Releasing his chute harness, he dove under
[457] the waves and swam the distance to the side of Carpenter's raft. "Hey!"
called the frogman to the spaceman. Carpenter turned and with complete surprise
asked, "How did you get here?" Shortly thereafter a second pararescue man,
Sergeant Ray McClure, swam alongside and clutched the astronaut's raft. The two
frogmen quickly inflated two other rafts and locked them to the spacecraft.
McClure and Heitsch later described the astronaut as smiling, happy, and not at
all tired. The pilot broke out his survival rations and offered some to the two
Air Force swimmers, who declined the space food but drank some space water.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.104"><SUP>104</SUP></A>
<P>The three men, still without radio contact, perched on the three rafts and
watched the planes circling above. One plane dropped the spacecraft flotation
collar, which hit the water with a loud bang, breaking one of its compressed-air
bottles. The swimmers retrieved and attached the flotation collar with only its
top loop inflated and then crawled back onto their rafts. Shortly a parachute
with a box at the end came floating lazily down some distance from the
spacecraft. The men on the rafts supposed this was the needed radio, and one of
the frogmen swam a considerable distance to get it. He returned with the
container, opened it, and found that there was no radio inside, only a battery.
Later Carpenter laughingly declined to repeat the swimmer's heated remarks.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.105"><SUP>105</SUP></A>
<P>The Air Force SA-16 seaplane from Roosevelt Roads arrived at the scene about
an hour and a half after the spacecraft landed in the Atlantic. To the SA-16
pilot the sea seemed calm enough to set his craft down upon and pick up the
astronaut, but the Mercury Control Center directed the seaplane not to land. As
later depicted by the news media and thoroughly discussed in Congress, this
delay grew out of traditional rivalry between the Air Force and the Navy.
Brigadier General Thomas J. Dubose, a former commander of the Air Rescue
Service, wrote to Florida's United States Senator Spessard L. Holland, charging
that Carpenter floated in the raft an hour and 20 minutes longer than was
necessary. D. Brainerd Holmes, a NASA official, testified at the hearings that
Admiral John L. Chew, commander of the Project Mercury recovery forces, feared
the seaplane might break apart if it landed on the choppy waters. Because of
this, according to Holmes, the decision had been made to proceed with helicopter
and ship pickup as originally planned.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.106"><SUP>106</SUP></A>
<P>After three hours of sitting on the sea in his raft, Carpenter was picked up
by an HSS-2 helicopter, but either the rotorcraft settled as a swell arose or
the winch operator accidentally lowered away, and the astronaut was dunked. Up
went his arm and the hand holding the camera to keep the precious film dry. With
nothing else amiss, Carpenter was hoisted aboard the helicopter, a drenched but
happy astronaut. Richard A. Rink, a physician aboard, described Carpenter as
exhilarated. The astronaut draped one leg out of the helicopter and, by cutting
a hole in his sock, drained most of the water from his pressure suit. He then
stood up and proceeded to pace around, sometimes settling in a seat, and
intermittently talking about his flight. Carpenter arrived aboard the carrier
<I>Intrepid</I> some four hours and 15 minutes after his return to Earth.
The medical [458] examinations began immediately but were interrupted when the
astronaut was called to the phone to receive what was by now President Kennedy's
traditional congratulatory call. The President expressed his relief that
Carpenter was safe and well, while Carpenter gave his "apologies for not having
aimed a little better on reentry." From the <I>Intrepid</I> the astronaut was
flown to Grand Turk Island, where, as Howard A. Minners, an Air Force physician
assigned to Mercury, described it, Carpenter wanted to stay up late and talk.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.107"><SUP>107</SUP></A>
<P><I>Aurora 7</I>, picked up by the destroyer <I>Pierce</I>, was returned to
Cape Canaveral the next day. When retrieved, the spacecraft was listing about 45
degrees compared to the normal 15 to 20 degrees, and it contained about 65
gallons of sea water, which would hamper the inspection and postflight analyses.
Carpenter recalled two occasions on which the spacecraft had shipped small
amounts of water, but he was unable to explain the larger amount found by the
pickup crew. The exterior of the spacecraft showed the usual bluish and orange
tinges on the shingles, several of which were slightly dented and scratched as
after previous missions. Since there was no evidence of inflight damage, these
slight scars presumably were the result of postflight handling. The spacecraft
heatshield and main pressure bulkhead were in good condition except for a
missing shield center plug, which had definitely been in place during reentry.
Some of the honeycomb was crushed, resulting in minor deformation of the small
tubing in that area. [459] Heitsch and McClure, the pararescue men, had reported
the landing bag in good condition, but when it was hauled out of the water most
of the straps were broken, probably by wave action. All in all, <I>Aurora 7</I>
was in good shape and had performed well for Project Mercury's second manned
orbital flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.108"><SUP>108</SUP></A>
<P>The postflight celebrations and honors followed the precedents and patterns
established by Glenn's flight. Administrator Webb presented to Carpenter and
Williams NASA Distinguished Service Medals in a ceremony at the Cape. Carpenter
also learned of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's cabled congratulations. Then
the astronaut's hometown, Boulder, Colorado, gave him a hero's welcome. After
being awarded a degree by the University of Colorado, where he had lacked a
credit in a heat-transfer course, the astronaut facetiously commented that the
blazing MA-7 reentry surely qualified him as a master in the field of
thermodynamics. Memorial Day found the pilot in Denver, where a crowd of 300,000
people cheered and honored him. The next day he returned to work at Langley,
where exhaustive technical debriefings were held to glean all the knowledge
possible from MA-7.<A

<P>In these postflight sessions the astronaut insisted that he knew what he
wanted to do at all times, but that every task took a little longer than the
time allotted by the flight plan. Some of the equipment, he said, was not easy
to handle, particularly the special films that he had to load into a camera. As
a consequence he had been unable to get all the pictures the Weather Bureau had
requested for its satellite photography program. Moreover, the flight plan that
had been available during training was only a tentative one, and the final plan
had been completed only a short while before he suited up for the launch.
Carpenter felt that the completed plan should be in the astronaut's hands at
least two months before a scheduled flight and that the flight agenda should
allow more time for the pilot to observe, evaluate, and record. When asked about
fuel consumption by the high thrusters, Carpenter replied that the 24-pounders
were unnecessary for the orbital phase of a flight.
<P>The astronaut recommended that some method be devised for closing off the
high thrusters while the automatic control system was in operation. He granted
that on the fly-by-wire, low-thruster operation, the spacecraft changed its
attitude slowly, as was shown by the needle movement, and that the pilot would
have to wait momentarily to pick up the desired attitude change rate. For
tracking tasks, however, the manual-proportional mode served well; attitude
changes could be made with only a gentle touch of the handcontroller. Talking
with newsmen after the flight, Carpenter assumed full responsibility for his
high fuel consumption. He pointed out, however, that what he had learned would
be valuable for longer Mercury missions.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.110"><SUP>110</SUP></A>
<P>As mid-year 1962 approached, Project Mercury faced yet another crossroad. Had
enough been learned during the two three-orbit flights to justify going on to
longer missions? Joe W. Dodson, a Manned Spacecraft Center engineer, speaking
before the Exchange Club of Hampton, Virginia, indicated that the MSC designers
[460] and planners and the operations team were well pleased with the lessons
derived from Glenn, from Carpenter, and from their spacecraft. They were pleased
especially at how well the combination of man and machine had worked.
<P>Shortly thereafter, the press began to speculate that NASA might try a
one-day orbital flight before 1963. Administrator Webb, however, sought to
scotch any premature guesswork until Gilruth and his MSC team could made a firm
decision. He stated that there might well be another three-orbit mission, but
added that consideration was being given to a flight of as many as six orbits
with recovery in the Pacific. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA's "general manager,"
told congressional leaders that if a decision had to be made on the day on which
he was speaking, it would probably be for another flight such as Glenn and
Carpenter had made. But many members of Congress wanted to drop a third
triple-orbit mission in favor of a flight that would come closer to or even
surpass Gherman Titov's 17-orbit experience.
<P>On June 27, 1962, NASA Headquarters ended the speculation by announcing that
Walter Schirra would pilot the next mission for as many as six orbits, possibly
by the coming September, with L. Gordon Cooper as alternate pilot.<A
href="notes.htm#n13.111"><SUP>111</SUP></A>
The original Mercury objectives had been met and passed; now it was time to
proceed to new objectives - longer missions, different in quality as well as
quantity of orbits. Project Mercury had twice accomplished the mission for which
it was designed, but in so doing its end had become the means for further ends.
