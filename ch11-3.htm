<H1>Last-Minute Qualms</H1>While the entire NASA program was under review by the 
new Administration in Washington early in 1961, Project Mercury was nearing its 
manned space flight phase. During the first four months of the year the major 
discussion would center around a proposed acceleration of the entire United 
States' space program to include a lunar-landing mission. Conversely, the 
Mercury program in the same time frame came under direct scrutiny of the 
President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which was charged with reviewing 
the scientific contents of all major Federal projects. Some members of PSAC were 
not fully satisfied that Project Mercury was all it should be, particularly with 
regard to the reliability of the Redstone and Atlas boosters and to the novel 
life-science hazards.
<P>The Mercury-Atlas and Mercury-Redstone failures of the year before, as was 
made evident in the January 1961 report of the President-elect's Space Task 
Force under the leadership of Jerome B. Wiesner, had not helped build the 
confidence of physical and life scientists that Mercury was truly a man- rated 
program. An ad hoc Mercury panel was created by PSAC to delve into the 
scientific details and reliability of the overall Mercury system and advise the 
President if it appeared likely that the United States would be beset with 
another well-publicized but inexplicable failure. Basically, the PSAC panel 
sought to investigate the level of risk involved in Mercury before a man was to 
be committed to an actual space flight. This inquiry was penetrating. Panel 
members spent five days in March visiting McDonnell, Space Task Group, and Cape 
Canaveral, receiving a series of detailed briefings and interviews. Several 
medical uncertainties appeared [348] outstanding and worrisome, although the 
panel had found the NASA presentations to be frank, competent, and impressive.
<P>The scientific objective of Mercury in determining the effects of 
weightlessness upon man, some felt, might have been pursued in a more clinical 
manner. Before the first manned flight there might have been a greater number of 
animal flights progressing toward absolute physiological and psychological 
limits. Past Mercury flight tests appeared more systematic for hardware 
engineering than for medical problems. As a case in point, it was noted by the 
panel members that the MR-2 mission had demonstrated excessive vibration and 
overacceleration in the launch phase, so that an additional booster test flight 
(MR- BD) had been inserted to precede the first manned suborbital flight. Pilots 
in the X-15 rocket research airplane, as well as Ham, the "space chimp" aboard 
MR-2, had recorded surprisingly high pulse rates concurrently with low blood 
pressures, yet there were no plans to include a blood-pressure measuring device 
in the upcoming manned flight (efforts to develop such a device were as yet 
unsuccessful). In addition, the panel members learned that Ham had taken his 
turn on the centrifuge, but that the acceleration profiles had no precise 
correlation with stresses and forces of those predicted for the MR-2 mission.
<P>Despite these gnawing medical doubts, in general the PSAC panel members felt 
that the Mercury hardware and its reliability had been developed with great 
care. They were especially impressed with the redundant systems of the 
spacecraft, as well as the procedures and devices that had been integrated to 
assure pilot safety during launch. In fact, several panel members stated at STG 
that it seemed everything necessary to assure pilot survival had been 
considered.
<P>In their final analysis, the PSAC panel assessed all risks and agreed that 
Mercury was ready to fly a man. The scientific purpose indeed was to determine 
man's suitability for the stresses and weightlessness associated with space 
flight.<A

<P>The orbital flight of Yuri Gagarin on April 12 seems to have removed any 
lingering medical qualms about manned flight. Mercury Director Gilruth had full 
confidence in the Space Task Group physicians and their endorsement by the space 
medicine community long before <I>Vostok I</I>. W. Randolph Lovelace II, 
Brigadier General Don D. Flickinger, and others familiar with the medical 
stresses of flight likewise had been convinced that pilot safety was fully 
assured. Yet if the medical profession as a whole had voiced scientific 
opposition to manned flight in Mercury, or if <I>Vostok I</I> had not flown when 
it did, it would have been impossible to proceed with a man in MR-3 
immediately.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source15"><SUP>15</A></SUP>
<P>Centrifuge tests of the astronaut's couch continued to raise NASA confidence 
in the adequacy of Mercury systems to maintain an astronaut's safety under 
acceleration into and deceleration from the space environment. But the abrupt 
negative acceleration of the final impact on Earth remained a nagging worry, 
particularly in case of a land landing. The aluminum honeycomb shock-attenuation 
material under the couch had been bought as insurance, but was it enough? 
Continued experiments early in 1961 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, 
[349] were conducted to determine how rapidly one could stop, facing aft in the 
semisupine position, without exceeding human tolerance. These tests showed that 
forces up to 35 times a person's weight could be endured for a fraction of a 
second. But the volunteers so tested were momentarily stunned. In theory, this 
meant that a spacecraft could land without an impact bag, but the idea of having 
a "slightly stunned" astronaut in what should be made a routine operation was 
unacceptable. So STG had reassigned the development of a suitable impact bag 
system to Jack A. Kinzler's technical services team and to Rodney G. Rose and 
Peter J. Armitage. These men worked around the clock in March and April trying 
to perfect a seaworthy shock-absorber. All other pilot-safety systems were ready 
for a safe and successful flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source16"><SUP>16</A></SUP>
<P>Barely a month had passed after the three chosen astronauts began training 
for MR-3 when the press began speculating as to which one would make the flight. 
On March 25, John Glenn became the favorite contender, although one report added 
that there was plenty of betting on Grissom, since the Air Force had been 
designated by the Defense Department to manage and conduct military space 
missions. This intimation of service competition spread quickly. Some newspapers 
even implied that the Army and Navy strongly suspected the Air Force had leaked 
Glenn's name to embarrass NASA and reduce his chances.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source17"><SUP>17</A></SUP>
<P>The astronauts themselves watched all these conjectures with amusement, 
keeping tight the secret knowledge of their order of succession. According to 
Voas, their psychologist and training officer, there was only one thing that 
terrified all seven: the fear that something might prevent one of them from 
flying his own mission when the time came.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source18"><SUP>18</A></SUP>
<P>Speculation on the designated pilot abated shortly after Robert C. Seamans, 
Jr., third in command at NASA Headquarters, appeared before the House Science 
and Astronautics Committee and testified that each astronaut would have his 
flight training opportunity aboard a Mercury-Redstone at six-week intervals. 
Gilruth had, of course, long since decided on an order of preference among the 
three astronauts designated, and had informed them of it, but everyone kept the 
secret well because of the ever present likelihood of unforeseen changes.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source19"><SUP>19</A></SUP>
<P>Toward the end of April there was so much publicity that some Senators, among 
them Republican John J. Williams of Delaware and Democrat J. W. Fulbright of 
Arkansas, thought the flight should be postponed and then conducted in secret 
lest it become a well-publicized failure. This was not the general view in 
Congress, however. Most members, while aware of the danger of too much 
publicity, felt tradition required the press to have free access to events of 
such magnitude as the first American manned space flight. Besides, the Russians 
had received international criticism for conducting an ultra- secret space 
program.
<P>While many highly placed officials, several close to President Kennedy, were 
apprehensive about the possibility of an overly publicized fiasco, others 
pressed to get the manned space flight program moving. On March 22, at a White 
House meeting, Hugh L. Dryden had explained to the President that no [350] 
unwarranted risks would be involved in the first manned Mercury flight, and that 
the decision to "go" was that of the project management best qualified to assess 
the operational hazards. When the notion was raised in late April that MR-3 
should be postponed until all possible hazards had been removed, Edward C. 
Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, 
observed to the President, "Why postpone a success?"
<P>President Kennedy wanted to be assured of a much better than average chance 
for success and asked for these assurances almost until launch. On the day 
preceding the flight, the President's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, called 
NASA Headquarters Public Information Officer Paul P. Haney at the MR-3 News 
Center in Cocoa Beach, Florida. She said the President wanted to review 
television coverage plans. Live coverage was to begin two minutes before launch. 
After some delay, Mrs. Lincoln said the President had asked Press Secretary 
Pierre Salinger to handle the call. Salinger said the President was concerned 
over the reliability of the escape system in the event of a Redstone 
malfunction. Haney reviewed the history of the launch escape system for the 
President's office and Salinger said the information should satisfy the 
President's inquiry.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source20"><SUP>20</A></SUP>
<P>Cancellation of the flight on Tuesday, May 2, because of inclement weather, 
forced a recycle of the systems countdown for a 48- hour period. On Thursday 
unfavorable weather again prevented the launch. Countdown did begin, however, 
for a Friday launch.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source21"><SUP>21</A></SUP>
<P>As it happened, the press and public learned the MR-3 astronaut's identity 
only after the countdown had been canceled, 2 hours and 20 minutes before 
launch, on May 2. Shepard had been waiting in Hangar S in his pressure suit 
ready to go for more than 3 hours. Gilruth reaffirmed his prime pilot decision a 
day before the scheduled launch, basing Shepard's selection on advice from his 
medical, training, and technical assistants.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source22"><SUP>22</A></SUP> 
But he had withheld his announcement because of the chance for a last-minute 
change.
<P>The American public participated vicariously in the experiment. For the first 
time, the maiden flight of a revolutionary manned vehicle, climaxing years of 
research and development, was open wide to public view. Only a handful of 
spectators saw the Wright Brothers accomplish man's first powered flight in 
1903. In many parts of the country and the world, people accepted that event 
only years afterward. But for the American taxpayers' first manned space flight, 
NASA arranged procedures well in advance to enable all domestic news media and 
foreign news services to view and report the events surrounding MR-3. By April 
24, some 350 correspondents were registered. As a result of their activities, 
the dateline "Cape Canaveral" soon became familiar to all the world. Radio and 
television coverage was equally energetic; telecasts originating at the Cape, 
particularly on May 5, were enthralling.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source23"><SUP>23</A></SUP>
<P>Starting at 8:30 p.m. on May 4, the countdown proceeded without a hitch. 
Around midnight a built-in hold was called for the purpose of installing the 
pyrotechnics, servicing the hydrogen peroxide system, and allowing the 
operations [351] team some rest. The countdown was resumed in the early morning 
hours of May 5, and another intended hold occurred some two and a half hours 
before the 7 a.m. anticipated launch to assure that spacecraft checkout was 
complete before transporting the astronaut to the pad area.
<P>Shepard, awakened at 1:10 a.m., began an unhurried but precise routine 
involving a shower and a shave. With his physician, William K. Douglas, his 
understudy, John Glenn, and a few other members of the operational team, he sat 
down to a breakfast consisting of orange juice, a filet mignon wrapped in bacon, 
and some scrambled eggs. Shepard had begun a low- residue diet three days before 
the anticipated launch. At 2:40 a.m. he received a physical examination. This 
was followed by the placement of biosensors at points indicated by tattoo marks 
on his body. He was now ready for Joe W. Schmitt, an STG suit technician, to 
assist him in donning the pressure suit.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source24"><SUP>24</A></SUP>
<P>Shepard entered the transfer van at 3:55 a.m. In the van, on the way to the 
pad, he lay on a couch while technicians purged his suit with oxygen. When the 
van arrived at the pad, Schmitt began to attach the astronaut's gloves while 
Gordon Cooper briefed him on the launch status.
<P>At 5:15 a.m. Shepard, carrying his portable air conditioner, ascended the 
gantry, and five minutes later he entered the spacecraft. If everything went 
well, he had two hours and five minutes to wait before liftoff. While Shepard 
was preparing to lower himself into the couch, his right foot slipped off the 
right elbow support. But he eased himself into position without further 
difficulty.
<P>Schmitt fastened the harness and helped with the hose connections. Then he 
solemnly shook the spaceman's gloved hand. "Happy landings, Commander!" chorused 
the gantry crew.
<P>For Alan Shepard, this was the most dramatic moment of his 37 years, a moment 
he would recall with the most acute poignancy for the rest of his life. 
Afterward he told how his heart quickened as the hatch was closed.
<P>The sensation was brief; his heartbeat soon returned to normal. At 6:25 a.m. 
he began a denitrogenation procedure by breathing pure oxygen. This was to 
prevent aeroembolism, or decompression sickness, the airman's equivalent of the 
deep- sea diver's bends.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source25"><SUP>25</A></SUP>
<P>Now the countdown resumed.
<P>At 15 minutes before launch the sky became slightly overcast, so photographic 
conditions were below par. Weathermen said the conditions would clear in 35 to 
40 minutes, and a hold was called. Shepard became resigned to this hold and 
relaxed by peering through the periscope. He was not uncomfortable, because he 
was able to shift his body in the couch. Telemetered biomedical data confirmed 
that his condition was good. While waiting for the clouds to clear away, a hold 
was called to replace a 115-volt, 400-cycle inverter in the electrical system of 
the launch vehicle. This hold lasted for 52 minutes, after which the count was 
recycled to 35 minutes before launch. [352] At the 15-minute point, one of the 
Goddard IBM 7090 computers in Maryland was found to be in error. Making this 
correction required a complete computer recheck-run. After a total hold time of 
two hours and 34 minutes, the count continued and progressed without more 
trouble. Shepard had been in the capsule four hours and 14 minutes when the 
final seconds ticked off to liftoff.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-3.htm#source26"><SUP>26</A></SUP>
<P>Two minutes before the launch, voice communications between the astronaut and 
the operations team switched from Cooper in the blockhouse to Donald K. Slayton 
in the Mercury Control Center. From that point until launch, the "talk" was 
continuous as each panel monitor advised Slayton of his system's status for 
relay to Shepard. To the astronaut the monitors seemed slow in reporting the go 
condition, and this he attributed to his own eagerness to be off. Schirra was 
now circling above in his F- 106 chase plane, waiting to follow the Redstone and 
Shepard as high as he could. Because of his excitement, Shepard said he failed 
to hear much of the closing countdown, with the exception of the firing command. 
During this period his pulse rate rose from 80 per minute to 126 at the liftoff 
signal. This rise caused no medical concern, for it was about the same as that 
of an automobile driver moving out from a service road to a freeway crowded with 
heavy traffic. Shepard was not alone in his excitement; he was joined by the 
operations team, the press corps at the Cape, and millions of people viewing the 
liftoff on television.<A
