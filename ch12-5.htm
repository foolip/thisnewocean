<H1>Man or Chimpanzee for MA-5?</H1>From its unseemly beginning embodied in the 
Mercury-Scout failure on the first day of its formal existence, the newly titled 
Manned Spacecraft Center would go on in November to direct and record a 
resounding success, Mercury-Atlas 5. A curious atmosphere surrounded the 
approaching animal orbital mission, a sense of impatience, as though the Nation 
wanted to see it done quickly so the program could hurry forward to a manned 
orbital shot. The press clearly deplored any slip in MA-5 that would delay the 
manned flight. Putting an American into orbit before the end of 1961 was 
popularly regarded as something sorely needed for national prestige. NASA 
officials obviously were influenced by these pressures, and rank-and-filers in 
the space program were like members of a football team committed to a warm up 
game before a conference classic.<A

<P>Some NASA leaders flatly opposed the chimpanzee flight. Administrator Webb's 
office questioned MSC on the need for another unmanned Mercury mission in view 
of the successful orbital flights of Cosmonauts Gagarin and Titov. A Washington 
newsman suggested that the President's advisers feared another American animal 
flight would only invite Soviet ridicule. Paul P. Haney, a public-affairs 
spokesman at NASA Headquarters, finally cleared the air when he announced to the 
public, "The men in charge of Project Mercury have insisted on orbiting the 
chimpanzee as a necessary preliminary checkout of the entire Mercury program 
before risking a human astronaut."<A

<P>Other space-related events soon distracted public attention from the [398] 
impending primate voyage on MA-5. One was the perfect launching of the mammoth 
Saturn I on its maiden flight. On the morning of October 27, the 163-foot-tall 
vehicle, with its 1.3 million pounds of thrust, rocketed 215 miles into space. 
The flight immediately triggered public discussion of whether a super-Saturn 
might be selected for launching the lunar mission spacecraft.<A

In Houston, the Manned Spacecraft Center, site for the direction of manned space 
projects of the future, captured the imagination of local citizens. A space-age 
tradition was born when H. T. Christman, a procurement officer, became the first 
member of the organization to buy a home in the Houston area, which was located 
in the Timber Cove residential development that was to become the neighborhood 
of several Mercury astronauts, near the site of the to-be-constructed Spacecraft 
Center.
<P>Preparation for MA-5, initiated many months previously, continued without 
much fanfare. As early as January 1961, notes on the status of hardware for this 
mission had begun to appear in STG's quarterly progress reports to NASA 
Headquarters. Both booster and spacecraft then were being manufactured and 
tested. On February 24, spacecraft No. 9 had arrived at the Cape to begin a 
40-week preflight preparation. This lengthy period, longest in the Mercury 
project, derived from the various flight program changes that required 
corresponding configuration changes. No. 9 had been configured initially for a 
ballistic instrumented flight, then for a ballistic primate flight, next for a 
three-orbit instrumented mission, and finally for a three-orbit chimpanzee 
flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-5.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>Another factor contributing to the long preparatory period was that the data 
obtained from the MA-4 mission demanded a number of modifications. For the 
environmental control system, a locking device was added to the oxygen emergency 
rate handle, while the inverters, one of which had failed during MA-4, were put 
through a severe vibration-test program. Since some unbonding had occurred on 
the heatshield of the MA-4 spacecraft, x-rays twice were made of the ablative 
layer to determine the soundness of the glue line. For the explosive side egress 
hatch, as yet untried on an orbital mission, thermocouples were added and a 
limit switch was installed to signal any premature hatch firing, an experience 
that cost the loss of a flight-tested spacecraft in MR-4. And the horizon 
scanner sensor system was modified to avoid the erroneous signals transmitted 
during the orbit of the "mechanical man."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-5.htm#source39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>Thus the spacecraft mounted on Atlas No. 93-D for MA-5 differed considerably 
from that used on the September orbital flight. This was another reason Haney 
had said that "the men in charge of Project Mercury" wanted another qualifying 
round before a manned mission. Besides modifications already described, No. 9 
had a landing bag installed and a large viewing window. Although the window had 
been used on MR 4 and had proved useful to Astronaut Grissom, it had not been 
subjected to the much greater reentry heat the MA-5 capsule would encounter. 
Aside from these new components, No. 9 had about the same equipment as carried 
in MA-4 - tape recorders for [399] gathering data and exercising the 
communications network, cameras, and radiation film packs. Of course, "Enos," 
the chimpanzee eventually selected from the colony in training, would need no 
simulator to do his breathing or perspiring. He had his own metal-plastic 
pressure couch, which was connected to the suit circuit of the environmental 
control system.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-5.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>The spacecraft operated in a fashion similar to the first orbital Mercury 
vehicle. Once again, as during MA-4, the hydrogen peroxide fuel supplies for the 
automatic and manual control systems were linked to provide a common reservoir. 
The automatic stabilization and control and rate stabilization control systems 
would be operated separately, so that the performance of each could be 
evaluated. The automatic system was programmed to exercise capsule attitude 
control until one minute after the .05-g light signal; then the rate system 
would take over for reentry, providing a constant-roll rate of about 7.5 degrees 
per second as well as damping motions in the yaw and pitch axes. The rate system 
would switch off at main parachute deployment.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-5.htm#source41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
<P>Recovery aids and operations, too, were about the same as for MA-4, including 
radar chaff, sofar bombs, a flashing light, and dye marker. The probable launch 
abort recovery areas were spaced and designated as before, although there were 
more contingency recovery areas because the mission was longer. For each of the 
three planned orbits about five contingency locations were selected. During the 
second orbit, for example, the emergency landing areas included the Atlantic 
Ocean near the west coast of Africa, the Indian Ocean near the east coast of 
Africa, the Indian Ocean near the west coast of Australia, and the Pacific Ocean 
either 440 miles southeast of Hawaii or 165 miles southwest of San Diego. The 
primary recovery zone shifted following the completion of each full orbit.<A

<P>Space Task Group officials expected delivery of the MA-5 launch vehicle, 
Atlas No. 93-D, about mid-August 1961, but it was decided by STG and the Air 
Force to delay shipment until the flight of MA-4. Then, when faulty transistors 
had delayed the MA-4 launch, intensive quality assurance inspections of the 
transistors had to be initiated. The electronic gear of the rocket was also 
modified, its 100-watt telemetry system was replaced by a 3-watt transistorized 
unit, and the autopilot circuitry was altered to alleviate the high vibrations 
experienced during the first orbital Mercury flight. These changes dragged the 
delivery date back to October 9, 1961. In Washington, George Low warned Seamans 
that the time needed to secure several components necessary for these 
modifications might affect the delivery date of Atlas No. 109-D, the booster 
scheduled to launch the first astronaut into orbit. No. 93-D was the third 
"thick skin" Atlas booster, employing a heavier gauge of metal in its forward 
tank.<A

<P>According to plans, which now were to approximate those for the manned 
orbital mission as nearly as possible, MA-5 would rise from complex 14 at Cape 
Canaveral on a heading 72.51 degrees east of north. Orbital insertion of the 
[400] spacecraft should occur about 480 miles from the Cape at an altitude of 
100 miles and at a speed of about 25,695 feet per second. Retrofire to initiate 
entry into the atmosphere was planned for 4 hours, 32 minutes, and 26 seconds 
after launch. Twenty-one minutes and 49 seconds later the spacecraft should hit 
the water in the Atlantic. Estimated temperatures during reentry should be about 
3,000 degrees F on the heatshield, 2,000 degrees on the antenna housing, 1,080 
degrees on the cylindrical section, and 1,260 degrees on the conical section. 
The STG operation planners estimated that the spent Atlas sustainer engine would 
reenter the atmosphere after 9 1/3 orbits, a considerable change from their 
estimates for the descent of the MA4 rocket.<A
