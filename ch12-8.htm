<P><CITE>A humorous view of the implications of the "monkey flights" to the 
space race was offered by cartoonist John Fischetti of the Newspaper Enterprise 
Association.</CITE>

<P>The press corps at the usual postflight press conference listened courteously 
to this technical postmortem, but their main concern was whether another test 
mission would be flown before a manned orbital flight. Williams and Gilruth 
cautiously replied that first the MA-5 data would have to be thoroughly 
evaluated. Then the reporters wanted to know who had been selected to make 
Mercury's first manned orbital flight. Gilruth was ready for that one; he 
announced the team members for the next two missions. John H. Glenn was the 
selected prime pilot for the first mission, with M. Scott Carpenter as his 
backup. Donald K. Slayton and Walter M. Schirra were pilot and backup, 
respectively, for the second mission.<A

This announcement represented a considerable change from the tighter news policy 
regarding crew selection that had prevailed in suborbital days.
<P>Meanwhile Enos had his moment. After the urbane anthropoid came [408] aboard 
the <I>Stormes</I>, he ate two oranges and two apples, his first fresh food 
since he had gone on a low-residue pellet diet. The destroyer dropped Enos at 
the Kindley Air Force Base hospital in Bermuda, where Jerry Fineg took over. The 
chimp was walked in the corridors and appeared to be in good shape. His body 
temperature was 97.6 degrees; his respiratory rate was 16; and his pulse was 
100. Apparently reentry, reaching a peak of 7.8 g, had not hurt him. His 
composure at his "press conference" surprised the correspondents. One reporter 
remarked that Enos, unlike Ham, did not become "unhinged" with the popping of 
the flash bulbs. On December 1, Enos reached the Cape for another round of 
physicals, and a week later he departed for his home station at Holloman, and 
well-deserved retirement.<A

<P>Enos' fame was short-lived. Public attention now turned to the supposedly 
imminent American manned orbital flight, although there still was no assurance 
that a spacecraft would next carry a man. Speculation mounted when Atlas 109-D 
was hauled into the Cape on the night of November 30. Newsmen immediately 
gathered around B. G. MacNabb, the Convair preparation chief, to ask when the 
checkout would start. "Tomorrow," he replied. When asked if there would be a 
crash effort in order to make the flight in 1961, [409] Williams said that three 
shifts were working a 168-hour week (all the hours possible), and that no 
special pressure would be applied. None of these statements dampened speculation 
by the press early in December. Signs, rumors, and portents cropped up daily. 
One correspondent, for example, noted that John Glenn had moved into special 
quarters at the Cape, adding that NASA had requested Atlantic Missile Range 
support beginning on December 20 and continuing to year's end.<A

<P>If NASA had ever been involved in a drive to put an American in orbit in the 
year of the Vostoks, that effort halted on December 7, the 20th anniversary of 
the Pearl Harbor attack. Almost casually Gilruth and Williams announced that the 
flight was now scheduled for early 1962. The decision, said MSC officials, had 
been influenced by "minor problems dealing with the cooling system and 
positioning devices in the Mercury capsule." The official press release did 
state that NASA considered the spacecraft, its systems, and the tracking network 
qualified for manned flight. It had been apparent to many NASA officials for 
some time that the manned orbital launch might have to be postponed until 1962. 
George Low, at NASA Headquarters, had recognized the probability soon after 
mid-October, when he wrote, "The pad conversion time between MA-5 and MA-6 is 
exceedingly short if MA-6 is to remain on schedule." On schedule meant December 
19.
<P>Hugh L. Dryden summed up his philosophy regarding adherence to schedules for 
manned flight when he said, "You like to have a man go with everything just as 
near perfect as possible. This business is risky. You can't avoid this, but you 
can take all the precautions you know about."<A

<P>Although there was regret that this country did not get a man into orbit 
before the Soviets, or at least in the same year, 1961 had recorded substantial 
progress toward making the United States a spacefaring nation. In contrast with 
the atmosphere of uneasiness marking the end of 1960, the Manned Spacecraft 
Center engineers now knew that they were on the brink on fulfilling Project 
Mercury's basic objectives. The rehearsals were over.

year later, on Nov. 4, 1962, Enos died of dysentery caused by shigellosis, which 
resists antibiotics. He had been under night-and-day observation for two months 
before his death. Pathologists at Holloman reported that they found no symptom 
that could be attributed or related to his space flight a year before.

absence for thousands of naval personnel in the recovery forces might have to be 
canceled without assurance that the flight schedule would be kept also entered 
into the decision to postpone MA-6, Williams said in interview.
