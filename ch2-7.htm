<H1>Space Radiation</H1>In addition to weightlessness, g loads, air, water, and 
food supply, isolation, and meteoroids, the problems of space flight included 
protecting the passenger from different kinds of electromagnetic radiation found 
above the atmosphere. Of the varieties of radiations in space the most 
mysterious is cosmic radiation, the source of which presents one of the grandest 
puzzles in nuclear astrophysics. Some of this radiation possibly comes from the 
Sun, but the preponderance of the cosmic rays bombarding Earth's atmosphere 
evidently originates outside the solar system - thus the term "cosmic" 
radiation. High-energy cosmic ray primaries - subatomic particles, of which 
about 90 percent are protons of hydrogen and helium - slam into the atmosphere 
at velocities approaching the speed of light. Fifteen to 25 miles above Earth, 
the cosmic ray primaries collide with atoms and molecules in the thickening 
atmosphere, are broken up, and are converted into lower-energy rays called 
secondaries. Above 25 miles the atmosphere becomes too thin to absorb the cosmic 
ray primaries; since they are capable of penetrating a thick lead wall, it was 
futile to try to shield a spacecraft pilot completely. So in the early 1950s 
medical researchers, assuming that a space pilot would be exposed to some cosmic 
radiation, approached the problem primarily from the angle of establishing how 
large a dose a human being could tolerate.<A

<P>As with weightlessness and g-load research, the best postwar device for 
studying cosmic radiation was the instrumented sounding rocket. But the last of 
the rocket experiments with primates occurred in May 1952. From that time until 
animal rocket shots resumed in 1958, the only upper-atmospheric research rockets 
fired in the country were occasional Aerobees, launched by the Air Force to 
altitudes of about 150 miles.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source55"><SUP>55</A></SUP> 
These shots, carrying only instruments, brought back a modicum of data on cosmic 
rays. The prime instrument for cosmic ray [50] research from 1952 to 1958 was 
the oldest vehicle for human flight, the balloon. The postwar development of 
sturdier, larger, polyethylene balloons to replace rubber aerostats made 
possible higher and higher ascents with increasingly heavier loads. At the same 
time the expansion of balloon technology, leading to an increasing number of 
giant, shiny spheres floating over the United States, multiplied reports of and 
popular interest in "Unidentified Flying Objects."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source56"><SUP>56</A></SUP>
<P>In the balloon-borne space radiation experiments of the fifties, the Navy 
carried out some notable manned ascents into the stratosphere. On November 8, 
1956, for example, Lieutenant Commanders Malcolm D. Ross and M. L. Lewis, as 
part of the Navy's Strato-Lab program of manned ascents from northern latitudes, 
reached 76,000 feet, then an altitude record. Less than a year later Ross and 
Lewis sat in their cramped sealed gondola as their huge polyethylene balloon 
ascended to nearly 86,000 feet. And in late June 1958 the same two Navy 
aerostation veterans remained in the 70,000-80,000-foot region for almost 35 
hours.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source57"><SUP>57</A></SUP>
<P>The Navy also pioneered in the use of balloon-launched rockets (rockoons). 
The first successful rockoon launch occurred in August 1952 when, from a ship 
off the coast of Greenland, a University of Iowa team headed by physicist James 
A. Van Allen sent up a balloon from which a rocket ignited at 70,000 feet and 
climbed to an altitude of nearly 40 miles. The Navy did most of its 
upper-atmospheric research, however, with instrumented balloon flights carrying 
small organisms and insects. In May 1954, for example, General Mills, 
Incorporated, under contract to the Office of Naval Research, launched a 
polyethylene balloon, with a capacity of 3 million cubic feet, that carried 
cosmic ray emulsions - plates designed for recording the tracks of ionizing 
particles - to an altitude of 115,000 feet. Five years later, from Sioux Falls, 
South Dakota, Raven Industries launched an Office of Naval Research balloon 
biological package to a record altitude of 148,000 feet.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source58"><SUP>58</A></SUP>
<P>The center of Air Force balloon research in the early 1950s was the 
Aeromedical Field Laboratory in New Mexico. From July 21, 1950, when Air Force 
personnel launched the first polyethylene balloon at Holloman Air Force Base, to 
December 18, 1958, the scientists at the field laboratory sent up 1000 research 
balloons, although only a small number of these ascents were designed expressly 
for cosmic ray study. In 1953 the Holloman researchers moved most of their 
balloon experiments to the northern United States, in the higher geomagnetic 
latitudes, where they could obtain increased exposure to cosmic ray primaries. 
During the next year they sent aloft a collection of radish seeds on a series of 
flights, compiling some 251 hours of exposure of the seeds above 80,000 feet. 
Monkeys, mice, rats, hamsters, and rabbits also drifted upward in balloons 
launched by Winzen Research, Incorporated, as a Holloman contractor, from Sault 
Ste. Marie, Michigan. The most interesting effect observed among the various 
test subjects was a striking increase in the number of gray hairs on black mice 
exposed to the high altitudes.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source59"><SUP>59</A></SUP>
<P>The first solo manned ascent into the stratosphere was also principally an 
undertaking [51] of the field laboratory at Holloman. In 1956 field laboratory 
experimenters inaugurated Project Manhigh, a series of flights from northern 
sites using Winzen balloons, to test man's ability to live for prolonged periods 
in a sealed-cabin environment like that inside a spacecraft and to gather new 
data on cosmic radiation. David Simons, head of the Space Biology Branch at 
Holloman, was project officer for the Manhigh ascents. The initial flight, from 
Fleming Field, Minnesota, took place on June 2, 1957. Captain Joseph W. 
Kittinger stayed aloft inside his sealed gondola for nearly seven hours, 
breathing pure oxygen, making visual observations, and talking frequently with 
John P. Stapp, the flight surgeon, and other physicians on the ground. Kittinger 
spent two hours above 92,000 feet; his maximum altitude during the flight was 
96,000 feet.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source60"><SUP>60</A></SUP>
<P>About nine weeks later Simons himself entered the space equivalent region, 
suspended in a sealed capsule below a 3-million-cubic-foot polyethylene balloon 
launched from an open-face mine near Crosby, Minnesota. Simons exceeded 
Kittinger's mark for both duration and altitude, staying aloft 32 hours and 
remaining at 101,000 feet for about 5 hours. Simons was the first man in history 
to see the Sun set and then rise again from the edge of space. In the <I>Manhigh 
I </I>gondola he spent more time than anyone before him looking upward at the 
blackness of space and outward at the white and blue layers of the atmosphere. 
"The capsule seemed like a welcome window permitting a fabulous view and 
precious opportunities, not a prison or an enclosure," he related after the 
flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source61"><SUP>61</A></SUP>
<P>In October 1958 an excessive temperature rise in the capsule forced a 
premature termination of the third Manhigh flight, carrying Lieutenant Clifton 
M. McClure.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source62"><SUP>62</A></SUP> 
Yet McClure's ascent, together with those of Kittinger and Simons, proved the 
workability of the sealed cabin for sustaining human life where "the environment 
is as hostile and very nearly as different in appearance as one would expect to 
observe from a satellite."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source63"><SUP>63</A></SUP> 
The environmental control system of the Manhigh capsule and the instrumentation 
for physiological telemetering were strikingly similar to those later used in 
the Mercury spacecraft.
<P>With regard to cosmic radiation, however, the Manhigh flights, like numerous 
rocket, balloon, and laboratory experiments of previous and succeeding years, 
returned data that were either negative or inconclusive. During the <I>Manhigh 
II </I>ascent two containers of bread mold were attached to the underside of the 
capsule, and Simons wore emulsion plates on his arms and chest to measure cosmic 
ray penetration. The plates did show indications of several hits by so-called 
"heavy" primaries - cosmic ray particles made up of nuclear particles heavier 
than are found in hydrogen or helium - but years later the skin in the area of 
the plates revealed no effects of radiation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source64"><SUP>64</A></SUP>
<P>All these experiments left most scientists as reluctant to speculate about 
the hazards from cosmic rays in flight as they had been in the early fifties. 
Simons felt that in manned orbital flights following roughly equatorial orbits, 
where the spacecraft remained within the protective shielding of Earth's 
magnetic fields, the spacecraft pilot would be in no danger from cosmic 
radiation. Yet he remained [52] troubled by the possibility that a solar flare, 
a sudden burst of energy from the Sun, might precipitate a great increase in 
cosmic ray intensity during a space mission. About a twentyfold multiplication 
of cosmic radiation accompanied a solar flare of February 1956. Simons' concern 
with solar flares led him to the conclusion that continuous voice contact 
between ground stations and the space pilot would be essential, as well as 
stepped-up efforts to predict the flares.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source65"><SUP>65</A></SUP>
<P>All proponents of manned space flight were alarmed when information 
transmitted from the first three Explorer satellites, launched during the first 
half of 1958, disclosed the existence of a huge envelope of radiation beyond the 
ionosphere. Evidently consisting of protons and electrons trapped in Earth's 
magnetic field, the radiation layer begins about 400 miles out in space and 
doubles in intensity about every 60 miles before tapering away about 1200 miles 
from Earth. This discovery was the first "Van Allen belt," named after James A. 
Van Allen, United States director of the International Geophysical Year 
radiation experiments. The <I>Pioneer III </I>probe, launched in December 1958, 
failed to reach escape velocity, but it did reveal that the radiation zone 
consisted not of one belt but of two at least - an inner belt of high-energy 
particles and an outer belt of less energetic particles. Two earlier Pioneer 
shots, in October and November, had shown that while the radiation zone was 
several thousand miles deep, it did not extend into space indefinitely.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source66"><SUP>66</A></SUP> 
Quite obviously, the doughnut-shaped Van Allen belts would pose a serious threat 
for manned travel in high orbits or interplanetary voyages. In the early manned 
ventures into space, however, a spacecraft could be placed in an orbit 100 to 
150 miles from Earth, high enough to be free of atmospheric frictional drag, yet 
low enough to stay under the Van Allen radiation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-7.htm#source67"><SUP>67</A></SUP>
<P>The radiation hazards of space flight also include solar radiation. Solar 
heat, ultraviolet rays, and x-rays all become much more intense beyond the 
diffusive atmosphere of Earth, but they can be adequately counteracted by space 
cabin insulation, shielding, refractive paint, and other techniques. Advanced 
space missions may subject astronauts to dangers from other kinds of radiation, 
such as the radiation belts surrounding other planets or the radioactivity 
produced by a spacecraft with a nuclear powerplant.<A
