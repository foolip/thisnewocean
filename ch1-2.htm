<H1>Conquest of the Air</H1>
<P>Man first ventured aloft in balloons in the 1780s, and in the next century 
gliders also bore human passengers on the air. By 1900 a host of theoreticians 
and inventors in Europe and the United States were steadily expanding their 
knowledge and capability beyond the flying of balloons and gliders and into the 
complexities of machineborne flight. The essentials of the airplane - wings, 
rudders, engine, and propeller - already were well known, but what had not been 
done was to balance and steer a heavier-than-air flying machine.
<P>On December 8, 1903, Samuel Pierpont Langley, a renowned astrophysicist and 
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, tried for the second time to fly his 
manned "aerodrome," a glider fitted with a small internal combustion engine, by 
catapulting it from a houseboat on the Potomac River. The much-publicized 
experiment, financed largely by the United States War Department, ended in 
failure when the machine plunged, with pilot-engineer Charles M. Manley, into 
the cold water.<A

The undeserved wave of ridicule and charges of waste that followed Langley's 
failure obscured what happened nine days later at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. 
There two erstwhile bicycle mechanics from Dayton, [6] Ohio, Wilbur and Orville 
Wright, carried out "the first [flight] in the history of the world in which a 
machine carrying a man had raised itself by its own power into the air in full 
flight, had sailed forward without reduction of speed, and had finally landed at 
a point as high as that from which it started."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source6"><SUP>6</A></SUP> 
Although few people realized it at the time, practicable heavier-than-air flight 
had become a reality.
<P>The United States Army purchased the first military airplane, a Wright Flyer, 
in 1908. But when Europe plunged into general war in 1914, competitive 
nationalism - drawing on the talents of scientists like Ernst Mach in Vienna, 
Ludwig Prandtl in Germany, and Osborne Reynolds in Great Britain, and of 
inventors like the Frenchmen Louis Bleriot and Gabriel Voisin - had accelerated 
European flight technology well beyond that of the United States.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source7"><SUP>7</A></SUP> 
In 1915, after several years of agitation for a Government-financed "national 
aeronautical laboratory" like those already set up in the major European 
countries, Congress took the first step to regain the leadership in aeronautics 
that the United States had lost after 1908. By an amendment attached to a naval 
appropriation bill, Congress established an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 
"to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight, with a 
view to their practical solution." President Woodrow Wilson, who at first had 
feared that the creation of such an organization might reflect on official 
American neutrality, appointed the stipulated 12 unsalaried members to the "Main 
Committee," as the policymaking body of the new organization came to be called. 
At its first meeting, the Main Committee changed the name of the organization to 
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and shortly "NACA" began making 
surveys of the state of aeronautical research and facilities in the country. 
During the First World War it aided significantly in the formulation of national 
policy on such critical problems as the cross-licensing of patents and aircraft 
production. NACA did not have its own research facilities, however, until 1920, 
when it opened the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, named after the 
"aerodrome" pioneer, at Langley Field, Virginia.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source8"><SUP>8</A></SUP>
<P>In the 1920s and 1930s aeronautical science and aviation technology continued 
to advance, as the various cross-country flights, around-the-world flights, and 
the most celebrated of all aerial voyages, Charles A. Lindbergh's nonstop flight 
in 1927 from New York to Paris, demonstrated. During these decades NACA brought 
the United States worldwide leadership in aeronautical science. Concentrating 
its research in aerodynamics and aerodynamic loads, with lesser attention to 
structural materials and powerplants, NACA worked closely with the Army and Navy 
laboratories, with the National Bureau of Standards, and with the young and 
struggling aircraft industry to enlarge the theory and technology of flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source9"><SUP>9</A></SUP> 
The reputation for originality and thorough research that NACA quietly built in 
the interwar period would continue to grow until 1958, when the organization 
would metamorphose into a glamorous new space agency, the likes of which might 
have frightened the early NACA stalwarts.
<P>[8] Over the years NACA acquired a highly competent staff of "research 
engineers" and technicians at its Langley laboratory.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source10"><SUP>10</A></SUP> 
Young aeronautical and mechanical engineers just leaving college were drawn to 
NACA by the intellectual independence characterizing the agency, by the 
opportunity to do important work and see their names on regularly published 
technical papers, and by the superior wind tunnels and other research equipment 
increasingly available at the Virginia site. NACA experimenters made discoveries 
leading to such major innovations in aircraft design as the smooth cowling for 
radial engines, wing fillets to cut down on wing-fuselage interference, engine 
nacelles mounted in the wings of multiengine craft, and retractable landing 
gear. This and other research led to the continual reduction of aerodynamic drag 
on aircraft shapes and consequent increases in speed and overall performance.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source11"><SUP>11</A></SUP>
<P>The steady improvement of aircraft design and performance benefited 
commercial as well as military aviation. Airlines for passenger, mail, and 
freight transport, established in the previous decade both in the United States 
and Europe, expanded rapidly in the depression years of the thirties. In the 
year 1937 more than a million passengers flew on airlines in the United States 
alone.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source12"><SUP>12</A> 
</SUP>At the same time, advances in speed, altitude, and distance, together with 
numerous innovations in flight engineering and instrumentation, presaged the 
arrival of the airplane as a decisive military weapon.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source13"><SUP>13</A></SUP>
<P>Yet NACA remained small and inconspicuous; as late as the summer of 1939 its 
total complement was 523 people, of whom only 278 were engaged in research 
activities. Its budget for that fiscal year was $4,600,000.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source14"><SUP>14</A></SUP> 
The prevailing mood of the American public throughout the thirties was reflected 
in the neutrality legislation passed in the last half of the decade, in 
niggardly defense appropriations, and in the preoccupation of the Roosevelt 
administration with the domestic aspects of the Great Depression. Without 
greatly increased appropriations from Congress, the military was held back in 
its efforts to acquire more and better aerial weapons. Without a military market 
for its products, the American aircraft industry proceeded cautiously and slowly 
in the design and manufacture of airframes and powerplants. And in the face of 
the restricted needs of industry and the armed services and severely limited 
appropriations, NACA kept its efforts focused where it could acquire the 
greatest quantity of knowledge for the smallest expenditure of funds and 
manpower - in aerodynamics.
<P>As Europe moved nearer to war, however, the Roosevelt administration, 
Congress, and the public at large showed more interest in an expanded military 
establishment, including military aviation. Leading figures like Lindbergh and 
Vannevar Bush, president of the Carnegie Institution and chairman of the Main 
Committee, warned of the remarkable gains in aviation being made in other 
countries, especially in Nazi Germany.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source15"><SUP>15</A></SUP> 
While the United States may have retained its aerodynamics research lead, the 
Germans, drawing, in part from the published findings of NACA, by 1939 had 
temporarily outstripped this country in aeronautical development.
<P>[9] After the outbreak of war in Europe, NACA eventually secured 
authorization and funding to increase its program across the board, including a 
much enlarged effort in propulsion and structural materials research. A new 
aeronautical laboratory, named after physicist Joseph S. Ames of Johns Hopkins 
University, former chairman of the Main Committee, was constructed beginning in 
1940 on land adjacent to the Navy installation at Moffett Field, California, 40 
miles south of San Francisco. The next year, on a site next to the municipal 
airport at Cleveland, NACA broke ground for still another laboratory, to be 
devoted primarily to engine research. In later years the Cleveland facility 
would be named the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, after George W. Lewis, 
for 28 years NACA's Director of Research.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source16"><SUP>16</A></SUP>
<P>Some nine months before Pearl Harbor, Chairman Bush of NACA appointed a 
Special Committee on Jet Propulsion, headed by former Main Committeeman William 
F. Durand of Stanford University, and including such leaders in aeronautical 
science as Theodore von Kármán of the California Institute of Technology and 
Hugh L. Dryden of the National Bureau of Standards.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source17"><SUP>17</A></SUP> 
Until then NACA, the military services, and the aircraft industry had given 
little attention to jet propulsion. There had been little active disagreement 
with the conclusion reached in 1923 by Edgar Buckingham of the Bureau of 
Standards: "Propulsion by the reaction of a simple jet cannot complete, in any 
respect, with air screw propulsion at such flying speeds as are now in 
prospect."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source18"><SUP>18</A></SUP> 
By 1941, however, Germany had flown turbojets, and her researchers were working 
intensively on the development of an operational jet-propelled interceptor. In 
Britain the propulsion scientist Frank Whittle had designed and built a 
gas-turbine engine and had flown a turbojet-powered aircraft.
<P>Faced with the prospect of European-developed aircraft that could reach 
flight regimes in excess of 400 miles per hour and operational altitudes of 
about 40,000 feet, NACA gradually authorized more and more research on jet 
powerplants for the Army Air Forces and the Navy. Most of the NACA research 
effort during the war, however, went to "quick fixes," improving or "cleaning 
up" military aircraft already produced by aircraft companies, rather than to the 
more fundamental problems of aircraft design, construction, and propulsion.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source19"><SUP>19</A></SUP> 
So, understandably and predictably, during the Second World War, Germany was 
first to put into operation military aircraft driven by jet powerplants, as well 
as rocket-powered interceptors that could fly at 590 miles per hour and climb to 
40,000 feet in two and a half minutes.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source20"><SUP>20</A></SUP> 
The German jets and rocket planes came into the war too late to have any effect 
on its outcome, but the new aircraft caused consternation among American 
aeronautical scientists and military planners.
<P>The Second World War saw, in the words of NACA Chairman Jerome C. Hunsaker, 
"the end to the development of the airplane as conceived by Wilbur and Orville 
Wright."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source21"><SUP>21</A></SUP> 
Propeller-driven aircraft advanced far beyond their original reconnaissance and 
tactical uses and became integral instruments of strategic warfare. The 
development of the atomic bomb meant a multifold [10] increase in the firepower 
of aircraft, but well before the single B-29 dropped the single five-ton bomb on 
Hiroshima, long-range bomber fleets carrying conventional TNT explosives and 
incendiaries had radically altered the nature of war.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>The frantic race in military technology developing in the postwar years 
between the United States and the Soviet Union produced a remarkable 
acceleration in the evolution of the airplane. Jet-propelled interceptors, 
increasingly rakish in appearance by comparison with their staid 
propeller-driven ancestors, flew ever faster, higher, and farther.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source23"><SUP>23</A></SUP> 
Following the recommendations of a series of blue-ribbon scientific advisory 
groups, the Defense Department and the newly independent Air Force made the 
Strategic Air Command, with its thousands of huge manned bombers, the first line 
of American defense in the late forties and early fifties.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source24"><SUP>24</A></SUP> 
To many people the intercontinental bomber, carrying fission and (after 1954) 
hydrogen-fusion weapons, capable of circumnavigating the globe nonstop with 
mid-air refueling, looked like the "ultimate weapon" men had sought since the 
beginning of human conflict.
<P>Working under the incessant demands of the cold-war years, NACA continued to 
pioneer in applied aeronautical research. By 1946 the NACA staff had grown to 
about 6,800, its annual budget was in the vicinity of $40 million, and its 
facilities were valued at more than $200 million. Although Chairman Hunsaker and 
others on the Main Committee felt that NACA's principal mission should be 
inquiry into the fundamentals of aeronautics, the military services and the 
aircraft industry continued to rely on NACA as a problem-solving agency. The 
pressure for "quick fixes" persisted as the Korean War intensified requirements 
for work on specific aircraft problems.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source25"><SUP>25</A></SUP>
<P>The outstanding general impediment to aeronautical progress, however, 
continued to be the so-called "sonic barrier", a region near the speed of sound 
(approximately 750 miles per hour at sea level, 660 miles per hour above 40,000 
feet) wherein an aircraft encounters compressibility phenomena in fluid 
dynamics, or the "piling up" of air molecules. A serious technical obstacle to 
high-speed research in the postwar years was the choking effect experienced in 
wind tunnels during attempts to simulate flight conditions in the transonic 
range (600-800 miles per hour). A wind tunnel constructed at Langley employing 
the slotted-throat principle to overcome the choking phenomenon did not begin 
operation until 1951, and a series of NACA and Air Force supersonic tunnels, 
authorized by Congress under the Unitary Plan Act of 1949, was not completed 
until the mid–fifties.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source26"><SUP>26</A></SUP> 
NACA investigators had to use other methods for extensive transsonic research. 
One was a falling-body technique, in which airplane models equipped with 
radio-telemetry apparatus were dropped from bombers at high altitudes. Another 
was the firing of small solid–propellant rockets to gather data on various 
aerodynamic shapes accelerated past mach 1, the speed of sound. Many of these 
tests supported military missile studies. The rocket firings were carried out at 
the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station, a facility set up by the Langley 
laboratory on Wallops Island, off the Virginia coast, in the spring of 1945. The 
Pilotless [11] Aircraft Research Division at Langley, until the early fifties 
headed by Robert R. Gilruth, conducted the NACA program of aerodynamic research 
with rocket-launched models.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source27"><SUP>27</A></SUP>
<P>The most celebrated part of the postwar aeronautical research effort in the 
United States, however, was the NACA-military work with rocket-propelled 
aircraft. In 1943, Langley aerodynamicist John Stack and Robert J. Woods of the 
Bell Aircraft Corporation, realizing that propeller-driven aircraft had about 
reached their performance limits, suggested the development of a special 
airplane for research in the problems of transonic and supersonic flight. The 
next year, the Army Air Forces, the Navy, and NACA inaugurated a program for the 
construction and operation of such an airplane, to be propelled by a 
liquid-fueled rocket engine. Built by Bell and eventually known as the X-1, the 
plane was powered by a 6,000-pound-thrust rocket burning liquid oxygen and a 
mixture of alcohol and distilled water. On October 14, 1947, above Edwards Air 
Force Base in southern California, the X-1 dropped from the underside of its 
B-29 carrier plane at 35,000 feet and began climbing. A few seconds later the 
pilot of the small, bullet-shaped craft, Air Force Captain Charles E. Yeager, 
became the first man officially to fly faster than the speed of sound in level 
or climbing flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source28"><SUP>28</A></SUP>
<P>The X-1 was the first of a line of generally successful rocket research 
airplanes. In November 1953 the Navy's D-558-II, built by the Douglas Aircraft 
Company and piloted by A. Scott Crossfield of NACA, broke mach 2, twice sonic 
speed; but this record stood only until the next month, when Yeager flew the new 
Bell X-1A to mach 2.5, or approximately 1,612 miles per hour. The following 
summer Major Arthur Murray of the Air Force pushed the X-1A to a new altitude 
record of 90,000 feet above the Mojave Desert test complex consisting of Edwards 
Air Force Base and NACA's High Speed Flight Station. These spectacular research 
flights, besides banishing the myth that aircraft could not fly past the "sonic 
barrier," affected the design and performance of tactical military aircraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source29"><SUP>29</A> 
</SUP>In the early fifties, the Air Force and the aircraft industry, profiting 
from the mountain of NACA research data, were preparing to inaugurate the new 
"century series" of supersonic jet interceptors.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-2.htm#source30"><SUP>30</A> 
</SUP>And representatives of NACA, the Air Force, and the Navy Bureau of 
Aeronautics already were planning a new experimental rocket plane, the X-15, to 
employ the most powerful rocket aircraft motor ever developed and to fly to an 
altitude of 50 miles, the very edge of space.
<P>Thus less than a decade after the end of the Second World War, airplanes - 
jet-powered and rocket-propelled had - virtually finished exploring the sensible 
atmosphere, the region below 80,000 or 90,000 feet. Much work remained for 
aeronautical scientists and engineers in such areas as airflow, turbulence, 
engines, and fuels, but researchers in NACA, the military, and the aircraft 
industry approached the thorniest problems in aeronautics with a confidence 
grounded in 50 years of progress. Man's facility in atmospheric flight and his 
adjustment to the airplane seemed complete. Pilots had mastered some of the most 
complex moving machines ever contrived, and passengers sat comfortably and 
safely in [13] pressurized cabins on high-altitude airliners featuring an 
unprecedented combination of speed and luxury. It appeared that man at last had 
accomplished what the ancients had dreamed of - conquest of the air.

was the so-called von Kármán Committee, established late in 1944 at the 
direction of Henry H. Arnold, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, and 
headed by Theodore von Kármán, of the California Institute of Technology. After 
surveying wartime achievements in aeronautical science and rocketry, the panel 
of scientists published its findings in August 1945 and its recommendations in 
December. While giving full credit to the German accomplishments in rocketry, 
the von Kármán committee concluded that jet propulsion offered the key to "air 
supremacy," and that progress toward long-range ballistic missiles should come 
through the development of air-breathing pilotless aircraft. The philosophy 
embodied in these 14 reports was to guide Air Force thinking for almost 10 years.

Horizons of Tomorrow: First Annual ARS von Kármán Lecture," <I>Astronautics</I>,

Kármán on the committee.

<P>The Langley engineers also pursued their transonic investigations with a 
method devised in 1944 by Gilruth, whereby small models of wings or complete 
aircraft were attached to the upper wing surface of an airplane, thus employing 
the accelerated airflow over the wing surface for studying the aerodynamic 
characteristics of the model at transonic speeds.

operating with an entirely new rocket powerplant, might not be ready as early as 
planned, the NACA-Air Force-Navy group concurrently developed a jet-propelled 
research airplane, the Douglas D-558-1. This was also in keeping with NACA's 
original conviction, shared by the Navy, that the first research aircraft would 
be turbojet-powered.

<P><A name=source30><SUP>30</A> </SUP>Probably the greatest NACA contribution to 
the century series (F-100, etc.) was a discovery made in 1951 by Richard T. 
Whitcomb, an aeronautical engineer working mainly in the recently opened 8-foot, 
slotted-throat tunnel at the Langley laboratory. Whitcomb collected data on the 
lengthwise distribution of fuselage and wing volume and suggested an airplane 
configuration that minimized drag at supersonic speeds. Whitcomb's findings, 
known as the "area rule," indicated that a coke-bottle, or wasp-waisted, shape 
would significantly increase the speed of jet-propelled airplanes. The 
importance of the area rule was reflected in the configuration of practically 
every jet interceptor designed and built for both the Air Force and the Navy in 
the mid-1950s. See Richard T. Whitcomb, "A Study of the Zero-Lift Drag-Rise 
Characteristics of Wing-Body Combinations Near the Speed of Sound," NACA Tech.
