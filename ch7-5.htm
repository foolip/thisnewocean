<H1>Critical Components of the Capsule</H1>Basic as the boosters were for 
successful manned space flight, they were not the only machines that had to be 
certified for safety before a man's life could be entrusted to them. The capsule 
with all its systems and subsystems, designed to operate automatically on 
unmanned test flights at first, would also have to have reliable provisions for 
operation with a normal, or even with an incapacitated or unconscious, man 
aboard. Man-rating the spacecraft, therefore, involved the paradoxical process 
of dehumanizing it first for rehumanizing later.
<P>When the seven Mercury astronauts first visited the McDonnell Aircraft 
Corporation laboratories and factory, for three days in May 1959, each was 
handed an indoctrination manual and given opportunities to inspect the mockup 
capsule and to review the requests for alterations made by the Mockup Review 
Board in March. Immediately they expressed some uneasiness about the poor 
visibility afforded by the two remotely placed portholes and about the 
difficulty of climbing out the bottleneck top of the capsule.<A

So, based on these and numerous other criticisms expressed by the men for whom 
these machines were being built, redesign studies were begun.
<P>Just as Maxime Faget was the chief NACA-NASA designer of the capsule 
configuration and mission concept, so John F. Yardley, his closest counterpart 
in the McDonnell organization, was the chief developer of the Mercury capsule. 
Neither Faget nor Yardley was the nominal leader of the vast team within which 
each worked, but both animated the technical talents of their colleagues, from 
design through the final development stages of the Mercury hardware. John 
Yardley held a master's degree in applied mechanics, had worked for McDonnell 
since 1946 as a stress analyst, strength engineer, and project leader, and he 
was exceptionally talented in his capacity for work and for synthesizing 
technical knowledge. By telephone, teletype, and face to face, Faget and Yardley 
consulted each other about the multitude of detailed design and development 
decisions involved in production throughout 1959. But their bilateral agreements 
were restricted to details. Larger decisions regarding the development of 
systems or interaction between subsystems were reserved for the 17 different 
working groups in STG and the 10 or so at McDonnell. James Chamberlin instigated 
this capsule coordination system and gradually replaced Faget in relations with 
Yardley during the next year.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>
<P>In 1959 the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation became the 100th-largest 
industrial company in the United States, employing approximately 24,000 people 
to produce goods (primarily the F4H-1 Phantom twin-jet fighter for the Navy) and 
services (mainly computer time, electronic equipment, and systems engineering) 
[191] valued at $436 million. Within this corporate context, the contract with 
NASA for about $20 million to manufacture 12 or more spacecraft, requiring only 
300 or 400 workers and representing less than five percent of McDonnell's annual 
sales volume, appeared rather minuscule. The president of the corporation, J. S. 
McDonnell, in September 1959 wrote for his twentieth annual report to 
stockholders that "there is no need to stampede away from the <I>air</I>craft 
business."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
<P>When the prime contract for Mercury was awarded to McDonnell, the 
Corporation's vice-president for project management, David S. Lewis, assigned 
Logan T. MacMillan, a tall, tactful test pilot and mechanical engineer with a 
winning manner, to be companywide project manager with authority to mobilize the 
resources of the Corporation for the new venture. MacMillan, of the same age and 
rank as Faget, soon found it difficult to reconcile McDonnell's development and 
production phases with NASA's concurrent research and test phases. Time, cost, 
and quality control were interdependent, and now the astronauts and STG had 
called for major design changes in the window size and placement, the side 
entrance-exit hatch, the instrument panel, and switch accessibility. To his top 
management, MacMillan reported on July 18, 1959: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Space Task Group is a rather loosely knit organization of 
  former Research Engineers. The Coordination Office is an attempt to channel 
  and control information and requirements against MAC more closely and is a 
  good move. It is clear, however, regardless of whether or not it succeeds, the 
  NASA philosophy of investigation and approval of the smallest technical 
  details will continue, and request for changes will also continue. We will 
  continue to handle this by being responsive to requests for studies and 
  recommendations and to be as flexible as we possibly can to incorporate 
  changes. It is imperative that we continue to improve our capability to make 
  these studies promptly, submit change proposals to cover the increased work as 
  soon as possible, and evaluate the effect of changes on delivery schedules 
  rapidly.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source51"><SUP>51</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>A 
month later MacMillan complained by teletype message directly to Paul E. Purser 
that coordination meetings were being held too frequently for effective action 
on items from preceding meetings. He suggested that later meetings be scheduled 
"for one month from time minutes are received at MAC." But the pace did not slow 
significantly; the finish line simply moved farther away.
<P>MacMillan and Yardley, together with Edward M. Flesh and William Dubusker, 
two older, more experienced production engineers, supervised the bulk of the 
load for McDonnell in tooling up, making jigs and fixtures, and organizing their 
craftsmen and procedures for production. Kendall Perkins, McDonnell's 
vice-president for engineering, had deliberately assigned Yardley and Flesh, 
combining youthful enthusiasm and experienced caution, to start the manufacture 
- literally the handmaking - of the first spaceframe. The subsequent design and 
technical development at McDonnell was carried out under their direction.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>By July 1959, Dubusker, the tooling superintendent, had completed McDonnell's 
first surgically clean "white room" for the later manufacturing phases, had 
taken on the job of manufacturing manager for Mercury, [193] and had moved some 
200 workmen onto the new production lines. Learning to fusion-weld titanium 
.010-inch thin in an encapsulated argon atmosphere was his first challenge and 
proudest accomplishment. But before the year was over, Dubusker had to contend 
with retooling for other unusual materials, with rising requirements for 
cleanliness, with stricter demands for machined tolerances, and with higher 
standards for quality control.
<P>Flesh, the engineering manager, and Dubusker drew on all of McDonnell's 
experience with shingled-skin structures around jet afterburners for heat 
protection. Their machinists had previously worked with the patented metal, Ren&eacute; 
41, a nickel-base steel alloy purchasable only from General Electric, but 
arc-jet tests of the afterbody shingles on the outer shell of the capsule showed 
a need for some ingenious new fabricating techniques.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>While Yardley and Flesh concentrated on developing the most critical 
components for the Mercury capsule, two other McDonnell employees began to play 
significant roles in man-rating this machinery. The company was fortunate to 
have its own so-called "astronaut" in the person of Gilbert B. North, another 
test-pilot engineer but one with a unique relationship for the NASA contract. He 
was always being confused with his identical twin brother, Warren J. North, who 
served Silverstein and George M. Low in Washington as NASA Headquarters 
participant and monitor in astronaut training. Gilbert North served McDonnell as 
chief human guinea pig in the St. Louis ground tests. Warren and "Bert" North 
actively promoted the incorporation of test-pilot concerns in the Mercury 
program from two standpoints outside STG.
<P>Most of the astronauts and test pilots, including the North twins, 
instinctively resented the "interference" of psychologists and psychiatrists in 
Project Mercury. Willing to wager their careers and perhaps their necks on the 
automatic systems of the capsule and booster, the pilots preferred to study the 
reliability of the machines and to assume themselves adaptable and self-reliant 
in any situation. They were thus unprepared to discover that psychologists would 
be among their strongest allies in gaining a more active role for man during 
Mercury missions. Throughout 1959, arguments over the necessity for the 
three-axis handcontroller, as opposed to the more traditional two-axis stick and 
one-axis pedal control system, demonstrated these pilots' confidence in 
themselves. Distrusting what they regarded as tender-minded psychology and 
psychiatry, the astronauts-in-training studied hard to become more tough-minded 
electromechanical engineers. And indeed their first complaints regarding 
spacecraft design resulted in changes adopted formally during September for 
later models of the capsule.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
<P>John Yardley fortunately was not quite so tough-minded and recognized early 
an imbalance in detail design considerations. He insisted on having the 
cross-fertilization of parallel human engineering studies. McDonnell hired in 
February a "human engineering" expert, Edward R. Jones, to conduct studies of 
pilot tasks and to analyze the various ways in which the man might fail his 
machines. Proposing straightaway a thorough training regimen for the astronauts 
in procedures [194] simulators, Jones went on to program a statistical 
computation of the human-factors implications of failures in the automatic 
systems in the Mercury capsule. By November 1959, Yardley and Jones together had 
convinced a majority of McDonnell engineers that man should more often be in the 
automatic loop than out of it.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
<P>Part of the problem faced by Jones, Yardley, and the astronauts in regard to 
human factors and the "inhuman" automatic control systems was the initial 
position taken by seven members of a study group at the Minneapolis-Honeywell 
Regulator Company in March 1959. Assigned to recommend approaches to mission 
analysis and cockpit layout, this group, led by John W. Senders, James Bailey, 
and Leif Arneson, had reported to McDonnell that since "this vehicle does not 
behave like an airplane . . . . There is no apparent need for a complex, highly 
integrated display configuration at a sacrifice of reliability."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source56"><SUP>56</SUP></A> 
Jones studied the Minneapolis-Honeywell reports carefully and said they 
expressed a "wooden man" approach. Assuming pilot safety would be provided for, 
Jones believed more provisions should be made for the pilot to assure mission 
success. In August, Jones and a colleague, David T. Grober, wrote for Yardley a 
description of the quantifiable differences between flying this spacecraft and 
flying aircraft. They admitted: "Primary control is automatic. <I>For vehicle 
operation, man has been added to the system as a redundant component who can 
assume a number of functions at his discretion dependent upon his diagnosis of 
the state of the system</I>. Thus, manual control is secondary."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source57"><SUP>57</SUP></A> 
But Jones and Grober pointed to at least eight ways in which automation for 
reliability could interact with the autonomy of the astronaut to vary the 
chances both for pilot safety and for mission success. They warned McDonnell's 
reliability engineers against assuming, as they had in their latest formal 
reliability program given STG, that the reliability of the astronaut is unity: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has been assumed naively by those who are not familiar with the 
  capsule that the operation of the systems will not be difficult because of the 
  automatic programming of the normal mission and because of an assumed 
  simplicity of the systems. However, preliminary analysis indicates that the 
  operation of the capsule, considering the stringent mission requirements and 
  the physiological environment, will be as difficult or probably more difficult 
  than high performance aircraft. A vast number of different potential 
  malfunctions may occur in the capsule's systems, and the isolation of these 
  malfunctions can be extremely difficult. <EM>Mission reliability 
  determinations assume the astronaut can detect and operate these systems 
  without error.</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>Only three months later Jones read a paper 
before the American Rocket Society that, while not a reversal of primary and 
secondary control modes for the manned satellite, marked a symbolic shift from 
automation to monitored automatic flight. Man's function in space flight, argued 
Jones, should now be recognized as something more than secondary, if still less 
than primary: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>[195] Serious discussions have advocated that man should be 
  anesthetized or tranquillized or rendered passive in some other manner in 
  order that he would not interfere with the operation of the vehicle . . . . As 
  equipment becomes available, a more realistic approach evolves. It is now 
  apparent with the Mercury capsule that man, beyond his scientific role, is an 
  essential component who can add considerably to systems effectiveness when he 
  is given adequate instruments, controls, and is trained. Thus an evolution has 
  occurred . . . with increased emphasis now on the positive contribution the 
  astronaut can make.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source58"><SUP>58</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Jones 
spoke, presumably, of the general attitudes prevailing around McDonnell. His 
fellow psychologist in STG, Robert B. Voas, supported his evaluation.
<P>Nevertheless, until some Mercury missions were flown automatically to qualify 
the integration of all systems, man would not be allowed to fly one. Of all the 
critical systems in Mercury, therefore, the automatic controls, a part of which 
was the "autopilot," were most crucial for man-rating the capsule.
<P>Guidance and control engineers in Project Mercury were often plagued by 
semantic confusions between the different electromechanical systems they 
designed and developed to stabilize, guide, control, or adjust relative motion. 
Their nomenclature helped confound confusion by the similarity of initials in 
official use to denote their orientation systems: ACS, ASCS, RCS, and RSCS all 
looked similar to men with other concerns, but some evolutionary reasons help 
explain the technical differences behind the initials. ACS, for Attitude Control 
System, applied specifically only to the Big Joe capsule, becoming a generic 
term in Mercury nomenclature after that launch in September 1959. In its place 
the redundant designation ASCS, for Attitude (or Automatic) Stabilization and 
Control System, grew up as a name for the autopilot, an airborne electronic 
computer that compared inputs of electronic sensory information with any 
deviation from preset reference points on gyroscopes or with the horizon. 
Outputs from the autopilot could then command small jets called thrusters to 
spew out small quantities of hot gas in order to maintain balance in space. 
These hydrogen peroxide jets, their fuel tanks, plumbing, and valves were called 
simply the RCS, or Reaction Control System.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source59"><SUP>59</SUP></A> 
The last of this quartet of initials, RSCS, requires a more thorough 
explanation.
<P>In August and September 1959, the stabilization controls and drag-braking 
drogue chute were proving troublesome, and everyone in STG knew this. Provisions 
for the astronaut, or "human black box," in the control loop complicated every 
facet of the system, and yet the pilot had little choice over its operation. 
Robert G. Chilton, Thomas V. Chambers, and other STG controls engineers 
reconsidered the several different ways in which the Mercury capsule was being 
designed to act by chemical reflexes with complete self-control.
<P>From the very beginning of controls design for a manned ballistic satellite, 
Honeywell had suggested using the same digital electronic system, for 
simplicity's sake, to control all Mercury flights. But this "simple" equipment 
was unnecessarily [196] complicated for the first flight tests and could cause 
some unnecessary problems. Also, a direct mechanical linkage to a completely 
independent, completely redundant reaction control system had been provided to 
ensure that the pilot could adjust manually and proportionally his capsule's 
attitude in orbit. But this overweight and oversize manual redundancy, 
fundamental to the Mercury objective of testing man's capability as a pilot in 
space, was an exceedingly uneconomical part of the original design.
<P>McDonnell and Honeywell controls engineers moved ahead with their development 
of the digital system while Chilton wrestled with the problem of raising the 
efficiency of the thirsty manual proportional thrusters. A wired jumper from the 
handcontroller to the jets for the ASCS should enable the astronaut to tilt or 
rotate his craft in its trajectory by electrically switching on and off the tiny 
solenoid valves that supplied hydrogen peroxide gas to the automatic thruster 
combustion chambers. Because this "fly-by-wire" system completely circumvented 
the autopilot, inserting the astronaut's senses and brain in its stead, it was 
not automatic. Rather, it operated semi-automatically; it would allow the pilot 
to aid or interfere with the automatic adjustment of rotation around his pitch, 
roll, and yaw axes. Thus in the autumn of 1959 the automatic attitude control 
system was already compromised by the addition of the semi-automatic fly-by-wire 
feature.
<P>But this redundancy still seemed inadequate for mission success. Both 
McDonnell and STG controls engineers proposed various approaches to other 
attitude control systems for the Mercury capsule in the spring and summer, but 
Logan MacMillan resisted all such suggestions, awaiting NASA's formulation of a 
definite policy for judging the urgency of contract change proposals. Every 
change would invite inevitable delays, and the long lead time for a new 
alternate control system (an AASCS!) made MacMillan, Yardley, and Flesh very 
skeptical of that approach.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
<P>The fresh insight of one of the Canadians in STG's flight controls section, 
Richard R. Carley, helped Chilton to see the need for a second completely 
independent rate-command orientation system. Together they wrote a compromise 
proposal early in July that served as the midwife for a "rate damping" system 
for stabilization control: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is a natural reluctance to relinquish the mechanical linkage 
  to the solenoid valves but the redundant fly-by-wire systems offer mechanical 
  simplification with regard to plumbing and valving hydrogen peroxide so the 
  overall reliability may not change appreciably. In fact, considering the 
  controlability of the capsule as a factor in mission reliability, a net gain 
  should result. Simulation tests indicate that manual control of the capsule 
  attitude during retrograde firing will be a difficult task requiring much 
  practice on the part of the pilot. By changing the command function from 
  acceleration to rate, the task complexity will be greatly reduced and the 
  developmental effort on display and controller characteristics can be reduced 
  accordingly.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source61"><SUP>61</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>[197] 
Out of interminable meetings and proliferating technical committees, a 
compromise did finally emerge. Chilton's group, together with J. W. Twombly of 
McDonnell, worked out the design for a semi-automatic rate augmentation system. 
By connecting three more wires from the handcontroller to the three pairs of 
solenoid valves guarding the fuel flow to the manual reaction jets, the 
designers built a bench version of a rate-command control system that utilized 
the small rate gyros formerly supplying the references only for cockpit 
instruments. For the production model, rate command fuel would be taken only 
from the manual supply tank. By the end of October, Chilton's group and 
Minneapolis-Honeywell had completed preliminary designs of this rate orientation 
system, now officially sanctioned as contract change No. 61 and called the 
"RSCS." But the difficult electrical circuit for its independent rate logic 
system was only in the breadboard stage: wires had been stretched over the 
two-dimensional drawings as a preliminary test of the circuit designs.
<P>The manual proportional method of slewing the capsule around required an 
extravagant use of fuel, but the rate mode relegated the manual to a last-ditch 
method of attitude control. Now with "rate command," essentially another 
fly-by-wire system superimposed on the manual reaction controls, the astronaut 
might control precisely his movements in pitch, yaw, and roll by small spurts of 
gas that would tip him up or down, right or left, and over on one side or the 
other. The exact attitude of the capsule at the critical time of retrograde 
firing could be held by this method, and the slow-roll stabilization of the 
capsule during reentry also could be accomplished by this system. Thus the quest 
for reliability led to four different methods of orienting the capsule by the 
end of 1959. Making both the automatic mode (through fly-by-wire provisions) and 
the manual mode (through the rate command, or RSCS) redundantly operable gave 
the astronaut three out of four options.
<P>McDonnell and STG already were working with nine major subcontractors and 667 
third-tier vendors, and the effort to man-rate all their products and all these 
subsystems - indeed each part from tiny diodes to the pressure vessel - required 
thawing out and refreezing the specification control drawings several times. 
When at the beginning of October NASA approved the funds for installation of an 
explosive side-egress hatch, a trapezoidal observation window, and another 
stabilization and control system, McDonnell engineers had already undertaken 
these and consequent redesign requirements. This independent advance action was 
evidence of a more advanced approach to the need for concurrent development and 
production.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
<P>To save weight without sacrificing reliability, the electronic specialists - 
like all other Mercury design engineers - looked for microminiaturized, 
solid-state components. But they found less than they hoped. Miniature parts 
were evolving rapidly into microminiaturized parts, but the latter did not have 
good reliability records yet. Collins Radio Company, for example, holding the 
subcontract for [198] capsule communications equipment,emphasized the 
conservative use of miniaturized but not superminiaturized components to achieve 
greater reliability.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source63"><SUP>63</SUP></A> 
Since the beginning of the development program the target of an effective 
capsule launch weight of 2,700 pounds had been overshot continuously, primarily 
because of slight but cumulative increments in electrical circuitry weights. 
Vendors consistently seemed to underestimate the weights of the parts they 
supplied. At the beginning of October the effective capsule weight was estimated 
at 2859 pounds. This seemed likely to grow to 3,000 pounds unless firm action 
was taken. A special coordination meeting in St. Louis at the beginning of 
October established a weight-reduction diet for the capsule development program 
and admonished NASA "all along the line to decide how much weight reduction 
should be sought and what items of capsule equipment should be sacrificed in 
order to achieve the desired reduction."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>
<P>At the time STG was considering the RSCS, it was also thinking of eliminating 
the 17.5-pound drogue parachute in the interest of weightsaving. The 
"fist-ribbon" drogue stabilizer, six feet in diameter and composed of concentric 
and radial strips of nylon, was being tested at Edwards Air Force Base and at 
the El Centro Naval Parachute Test Facility, at subsonic and transonic speeds 
and at altitudes down from 70,000 feet over the Salton Sea. One of the first 
canopies, released at a speed of mach 1.08 from an F-104 jet fighter at an 
altitude above 10 miles, plummeted into denser air whipping, fluttering, and 
spinning so badly that it disintegrated after a minute of this punishment. This 
test had put a special premium on development of the rate stabilization control 
system.
<P>The recent decision to substitute a ring-sail for the extended-skirt main 
landing parachute made Gilruth fear that there might not be enough experience 
with big parachutes to determine whether they had similar bad characteristics. 
Gilruth and Donlan were so unsettled by the chute tests in general that they 
appealed to Washington for an expansion of applied research programs aimed at 
the development of more reliable parachute systems: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is apparent that the large load cargo type of parachute is far 
  from as reliable as the personnel parachute that most people are familiar 
  with. Part of this lack of reliability is due to unknown scale effects, 
  perhaps. However, it is known that a great deal of this loss of reliability is 
  due to the various fixes that are employed on large parachutes to attenuate 
  the opening shock. Such fixes as extended skirts, slots, reefing, and other 
  devices are designed to cause a parachute to open more slowly. Therefore, it 
  is not surprising that this tendency to open slower is also accompanied by a 
  tendency not to open at all.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source65"><SUP>65</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Continued 
tests of the main parachute revealed few additional problems, but the drogue 
chute tests were getting worse. By the end of September the problem of drogue 
behavior at relatively high altitudes and barely supersonic speeds was so 
critical that the director of Langley thought it might be "easier to avoid than 
to solve."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source66"><SUP>66</SUP></A> 
All sorts of alternatives, including a flexible inflatable-wing glider proposed 
by Francis M. Rogallo of Langley,a string of discs trailing like a Chinese [199] 
kite, and simple spherical balloons, were proposed as possible means of avoiding 
the instability of porous parachute canopies at high altitudes, where the air to 
inflate them is so rare.
<P>Toward the end of 1959 still another lesson learned from studies of the 
aerodynamic stability of the capsule in the rarefied upper atmosphere added a 
slight refinement to the Mercury configuration. To break a possible "freeze" if 
the stable capsule should reenter the atmosphere small end forward, a 
spring-loaded destabilizing flap was installed under the escape pylon. Donlan 
and Purser asked George Low to explain around Washington why this "mousetrap" 
destabilizing flap was added to the antenna canister and why this innovation 
would require further wind tunnel tests:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Mercury exit configuration ( antenna canister forward without 
  escape tower) has been shown to be statically stable at mach numbers greater 
  than four. This stability is undesirable because of the possibility of the 
  capsule reentering the atmosphere antenna canister forward. Tunnel tests at a 
  mach number of six have indicated that a destabilizing flap prevents this 
  undesirable stability region. It is therefore necessary to know the effect of 
  this destabilizing flap at subsonic and supersonic speeds.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source67"><SUP>67</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Continued poor performance of the fist-ribbon drogue convinced Faget, 
Chamberlin, and Yardley by the end of 1959 that the drogue chute should be 
eliminated altogether, but Gilruth and Purser, among others, saw as yet no 
cheaper insurance and no more workable alternative.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-5.htm#source68"><SUP>68</SUP></A> 
The mousetrap destabilization flap and the rate stabilization system would help 
to fill only the mid-portion of the gap in the reentry flight profile. It was 
still a long way down from 100,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level - roughly 17 
miles as a rock might drop. But by this time, the big questions concerning the 
first part of the reentry profile had been answered by the Big Joe flight.

<P>
<P><A name=source59><SUP>59</SUP></A> The input of sense data into the ASCS and 
its output of nervous commands suggests the classic cybernetic approach to 
understanding the Mercury attitude control system. Consider the machine as if it 
were an organism in which sensors (like small rate gyros, larger position gyros, 
and infrared sensitive horizon scanners) provide the brain (ASCS) with the data 
it needs to compute through its amplifier-calibrators and logic boards the 
actions required by the muscles (RCS motors) in order to maintain a certain 
position. Sense organs, a brain, and muscles are necessary black boxes to the 
performance of any self-regulating system, but Mercury design engineers seldom 
bothered at first to produce "glass boxes" for operating engineers to determine 
how to build, work, and improve them. For a helpful introduction to the 
intricacies of modern gyroscopes, accelerometers, and inertial guidance systems, 
see "Inertial Guidance Primer," pamphlet, Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator 
Company, 1963.
