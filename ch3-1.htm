<H1>Aeronautics to Astronautics: NACA Research</H1>
<H2>(1952 - 1957)</H2>LITTLE known outside the military services and the 
aircraft industry, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics by the early 
1950s had far outgrown its name and could look back on nearly four decades 
filled with landmark contributions to military and civilian aeronautics. NACA 
had matured much beyond its original "advisory" capacity, had established three 
national laboratories, and had become perhaps the world's foremost aeronautical 
research organization. Drag-reducing engine cowlings, wing fillets, retractable 
landing gear, thin swept wings, and new fuselage shapes for supersonic aircraft 
- these were only a few of the numerous innovations leading to improved airplane 
performance that were wholly or partially attributable to the agency. NACA had 
pioneered in institutionalized team research - "big science," as opposed to the 
"little science" of individual researchers working alone or in small academic 
groups - and over the years such activity had paid off handsomely for the 
Nation.<A

NACA's relative importance in the totality of American aeronautics had declined 
after the Second World with the enormous increase in military research and 
development programs, but NACA did not exaggerate when it asserted that 
practically every airplane aloft reflected some aspect of its research 
achievements.
<P>The contributions of NACA in aeronautics were spectacular, but regarding the 
inchoate discipline of astronautics, especially rocket propulsion research, the 
agency, like the rest of the country, was skeptical, conservative, reticent. The 
prevailing prewar attitude within NACA toward rocket technology was expressed in 
1940 by Jerome C. Hunsaker, then a member and later chairman of NACA's Main 
Committee. Discussing an Army Air Corps contract with the California Institute 
of Technology for rocket research in relation to current NACA work on the 
deicing of aircraft windshields, Hunsaker said to Theodore von Kármán of 
CalTech, "You can have the Buck Rogers job."<A

<P>In the early postwar years the leaders of NACA viewed rocket experimentation, 
such as the program beginning in 1945 at the Pilotless Aircraft Research 
Station, [56] on Wallops Island, Virginia, as essentially a tool for 
aerodynamics research furthering the progress of supersonic flight within the 
atmosphere. NACA's annual report for 1948, for example, mentioned the heating 
rates generated on the noses of the V-2s then being fired at White Sands, but 
discussed the problem of structural heating only in the context of aircraft.<A

<P>At the request of the military services, the Langley, Lewis, and Ames 
laboratories did study the theoretical performance of missiles, the operation of 
rocket engines, the composition of rocket fuels, and automatic control 
arrangements for supersonic guided missiles and aircraft. But such research 
accounted for only a small percentage of the total NACA workload and budgetary 
allotments. The annual budget cuts suffered by NACA, beginning in 1949 and 
reaching a high point in 1954 when the agency received only a little more than 
half its request, perhaps intensified the scientific conservatism of the NACA 
leaders, while the Korean War once again shifted most NACA laboratory work to 
the "cleaning up" of military aircraft.<A

It was in this climate of declining support for flight research in 1953 that 
NACA Director Hugh L. Dryden, who less than ten years later would be helping 
manage a manned lunar-landing program, wrote, "I am reasonably sure that travel 
to the moon will not occur in my lifetime ...."<A

Dryden's words were prophetic for himself if not for his generation. He died in 
December 1965, two months before the first major launch in the Apollo program.
