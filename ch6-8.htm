<H1>Astronaut Selection</H1>Now that the men had been chosen to serve as the 
focal points for all this effort, new spirits animated the Space Task Group. 
Indeed, the Nation as a whole [160] began to participate vicariously in Project 
Mercury when, on April 9, 1959, at a press conference in Washington, Glennan 
introduced to the public the seven men chosen to be this Nation's nominees for 
the first human voyagers into space.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source70"><SUP>70</SUP></A>
<P>They were to be called "astronauts," as the pioneers of ballooning had been 
called "aeronauts," and the legendary Greeks in search of the Golden Fleece were 
called "Argonauts," for they were to sail into a new, uncharted ocean. These 
personable pilots were introduced in civilian dress; many people in their 
audience forgot that they were volunteer test subjects and military officers. 
Their public comments did not class them with any elite intelligentsia. Rather 
they were a contingent of mature Americans, average in build and visage, family 
men all, college-educated as engineers, possessing excellent health, and 
professionally committed to flying advanced aircraft.
<P>Compared with the average, white, middle-class American male, they enjoyed 
better health, both physically and psychologically, and they had far more 
experience among and above the clouds. Slightly short of average in stature, 
they were above average in seriousness of purpose. Otherwise these seven seemed 
almost random samples of average American manhood. Yet the names of Carpenter, 
Cooper, Glenn, Grissom, Schirra, Shepard, and Slayton were perhaps to become as 
familiar in American history as those of any actor, soldier, or athlete.
<P>Despite the wishes of NASA Headquarters, and particularly of Dryden, 
Silverstein, and Gilruth, the fame of the astronauts quickly grew beyond all 
proportion to their current activities and their preflight mission assignments. 
Perhaps it was inevitable that the "crew-pool" members of STG were destined for 
premature adulation, what with the enormous public curiosity about them, the 
risk they would take in space flight, and their exotic training activities. But 
the power of commercial competition for publicity and the pressure for political 
prestige in the space race also whetted an insatiable public appetite for this 
new kind of celebrity. Walter T. Bonney, long a public information officer for 
NACA and now Glennan's adviser on these matters, foresaw the public and press 
attention, asked for an enlarged staff, and laid the guidelines for public 
affairs policy in close accord with that of other Government agencies.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source71"><SUP>71</SUP></A>
<P>The astronauts were first and foremost test pilots, men accustomed to flying 
alone in the newest, most advanced, and most powerful vehicles this civilization 
had produced. They were talented specialists who loved to fly high-performance 
aircraft and who had survived the natural selection process in their profession. 
The demand for excellence in piloting skills, in physical health, and 
psychological adaptability becomes ever more stringent as one ascends the ladder 
toward the elite among military aviators, those senior test pilots with upwards 
of 1,500 hours' total flying time.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source72"><SUP>72</SUP></A>
<P>Eisenhower's decision that the military services could provide the pilots 
greatly simplified the astronaut selection procedure. From a total of 508 
service records screened in January 1959 by Stanley C. White, Robert B. Voas, 
and William S. Augerson at the military personnel bureaus in Washington, 110 men 
were found to [161] meet the minimum standards specified earlier. This list of 
names included five Marines, 47 Navy men, and 58 Air Force pilots. Several Army 
pilots' records had been screened earlier, but none was a graduate of a test 
pilot school. The selection process began while the possibility of manned 
Redstone flights late in 1959 still existed on paper.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source73"><SUP>73</SUP></A>
<P>The evaluation committee at Headquarters, headed by the Assistant Director of 
STG, Charles J. Donlan, decided to divide the list of 110 arbitrarily into three 
groups and to issue invitations for the first group of 35 to come to Washington 
at the beginning of February for briefings and interviews. Donlan was pleased to 
learn from his staff, White, Voas, and Augerson, that 24 of the first group 
interviewed were happy with the prospects of participating in the Mercury 
program. Every one of the first 10 men interrogated on February 2 agreed to 
continue through the elimination process. The next week another group of 
possible pilot-candidates arrived in Washington. The high rate of volunteering 
made it unnecessary to extend the invitations to the third group. Justifying 
this action, George Low reported: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the briefings and interviews it became apparent that the 
  final number of pilots should be smaller than the twelve originally planned 
  for. The high rate of interest in the project indicates that few, if any, of 
  the men will drop out during the training program. It would, therefore, not be 
  fair to the men to carry along some who would not be able to participate in 
  the flight program. Consequently, a recommendation has been made to name only 
  six finalists.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source74"><SUP>74</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Sixty-nine 
men had reported to Washington in two groups by the middle of February. Of 
these, six were found to have grown too tall. Fifty-six test pilots took the 
initial battery of written tests, technical interviews, psychiatric interviews, 
and medical history reviews. Those who declined or were eliminated reduced the 
total at the beginning of March to 36 men. They were invited to undergo the 
extraordinary physical examinations planned for them at the Lovelace Clinic in 
Albuquerque. Thirty-two accepted and became candidates, knowing also that they 
were scheduled to pass through extreme mental and physical environmental tests 
at the Wright Air Development Center, in Dayton, Ohio, after being certified as 
physically qualified by the Lovelace Clinic. The 32 candidates were assured that 
the data derived from these special examinations in New Mexico and Ohio would 
not jeopardize their military careers, since none of the findings was to go into 
their service records.
<P>Although the psychophysiological criteria for the selection of the best 
possible pilots for manned space flight had been under discussion for several 
years, the actual arrangement of the selection procedures for Mercury was 
directed by a NASA selection committee consisting of a senior management 
engineer, Donlan; a test pilot engineer, North; two flight surgeons, White and 
Augerson; two psychologists, Allen O. Gamble and Voas; and two psychiatrists, 
George E. Ruff and Edwin Z. Levy. These seven men had done the screening of 
records and the interviews and testing in Washington, constituting phases one 
and two of the [162] selection program, before remanding their pool of 32 
candidates to the medical examiners at the Lovelace Foundation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source75"><SUP>75</SUP></A>
<P>Individually each candidate arrived at Albuquerque to undergo approximately a 
week of medical evaluations under each of five different schedules. In this 
third phase of the program, over 30 different laboratory tests collected 
chemical, encephalographic, and cardiographic data. X-ray examinations 
thoroughly mapped each man's body. The ophthalmology section and the 
otolaryngology sections likewise learned almost everything about each 
candidate's eyes, and his ears, nose, and throat. Special physiological 
examinations included bicycle ergometer tests, a total-body radiation count, 
total-body water determination, and the specific gravity of the whole body. 
Heart specialists made complete cardiological examinations, and other clinicians 
worked out more complete medical histories on these men than probably had ever 
before been attempted on human beings. Nevertheless the selectees were so 
healthy that only one of the 32 was found to have a medical problem potentially 
serious enough to eliminate him from the subsequent tests at the Wright 
Aeromedical Laboratory.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source76"><SUP>76</SUP></A>
<P>Phase four of the selection program was an amazingly elaborate set of 
environmental studies, physical endurance tests, anthropometric measurements, 
and psychiatric studies conducted at the Aeromedical Laboratory of the Wright 
Air Development Center. During March each of the 31 subjects spent another week 
experiencing a wide range of stressful conditions. Voas explained phases three 
and four: "While the purpose of the medical examinations at Lovelace Clinic had 
been to determine the general health status of the candidates, the purpose of 
the testing program at Wright Field was to determine the physical and 
psychological capability of the individual to respond effectively and 
appropriately to the various types of stresses associated with space 
missions."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source77"><SUP>77</SUP></A> 
In addition to pressure suit tests, acceleration tests, vibration tests, heat 
tests, and loud noise tests, each candidate had to prove his physical endurance 
on treadmills, tilt tables, with his feet in ice water, and by blowing up 
balloons until exhausted. Continuous psychiatric interviews, the necessity of 
living with two psychologists throughout the week, an extensive self-examination 
through a battery of 13 psychological tests for personality and motivation, and 
another dozen different tests on intellectual functions and special aptitudes - 
these were all part of the week of truth at Dayton.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source78"><SUP>78</SUP></A>
<P>Two of the more interesting personality and motivation studies seemed like 
parlor games at first, until it became evident how profound an exercise in 
Socratic introspection was implied by conscientious answers to the test 
questions "Who am I?" and "Whom would you assign to the mission if you could not 
go yourself?" In the first case, by requiring the subject to write down 20 
definitional identifications of himself, ranked in order of significance, and 
interpreted projectively, the psychologists elicited information on identity and 
perception of social roles. In the peer ratings, each candidate was asked which 
of the other members of the group of five accompanying him through this phase of 
the program he liked best, [163] which one he would like to accompany him on a 
two-man mission, and whom he would substitute for himself. Candidates who had 
proceeded this far in the selection process all agreed with one who complained, 
"Nothing is sacred any more."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source79"><SUP>79</SUP></A>
<P>Back at STG headquarters at Langley, late in March 1959, phase five began. 
The final evaluation of data was made by correlating clinical and statistical 
information from New Mexico and Ohio. Eighteen of the 31 candidates came 
recommended without medical reservations for final consideration by Donlan and 
North. According to Donlan, although the physicians, psychiatrists, 
psychologists, and physiologists had done their best to establish gradations, 
the attrition rate was too low. So the final criteria for selecting the 
candidates reverted to the technical qualifications of the men and the technical 
requirements of the program, as judged by Donlan, North, White, and finally 
Gilruth. "We looked for real men and valuable experience," said Donlan. The 
selection tests, as it turned out, were largely tests of tests, "conducted as 
much for the research value in trying to formulate the characteristics of 
astronauts as for determining any deficiencies of the group being examined." The 
verbal responses at the interviews, before and after the psychophysiological 
testing, therefore, seem to have been as important final determinants as the 
candidates' test scores.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source80"><SUP>80</SUP></A>
<P>Sitting in judgment over 18 finalists, Donlan, White, and North pared down 
the final pool of selectees, choosing each to complement the rest of the group. 
The going was so difficult that they could not reach the magic number six, so 
Gilruth decided to recommend seven. Donlan then telephoned each of the seven 
individually to ask whether he was still willing to accept a position as a 
Mercury astronaut. Each one gladly volunteered again. The 24 who were passed 
over were notified and asked to reapply for reconsideration in some future 
program. Gilruth's endorsement of the final list was passed upward to 
Silverstein and Glennan for final review, and by mid-April the faces of 
America's original seven spacemen were shown to the world.
<P>As the astronauts lost their private lives, Project Mercury found its first 
great public notice. An eighth military officer and pilot came aboard STG about 
the same time to manage the public information and press relations that were 
already threatening to intrude on the time and talent of STG. The eighth 
personality was an experienced Air Force pilot who had flown extensively in 
World War II, on the Berlin Airlift, and in Korea, and who also had proven 
himself as a public information officer after 1954, when he was charged with 
ameliorating public fears and complaints over jet noises, sonic booms, and the 
ballistic missile programs.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source81"><SUP>81</SUP></A> 
Lieutenant Colonel John A. Powers, USAF, came on board the STG staff in early 
April 1959. Thereafter the mellifluous voice and impish grin of "Shorty" Powers 
made his reputation as the primary buffer for STG in its relations with the 
press and the public. Throughout the Mercury program, he stood before the news 
media and the people of the world as the one living symbol of all the anonymous 
human effort behind the astronaut of the moment.
<P>Powers propagated some oversimplified images in many instances, as it was 
[164] his job to do, but no one man then or now could completely understand or 
communicate the complexity of the myriad research, development, and operations 
activities that lay behind a launch. Then, too, the caliber of the questions 
determined the quality of his answers, and all too often the questions asked 
were simple. What was an astronaut really like? What did he eat for breakfast? 
Which ones had been Boy Scouts? How did their wives take their commitment? Such 
questions provoked many to abandon asking how these seven came to be chosen and 
for what purpose they were entering training.
<P>From the United States Marine Corps, Lieutenant Colonel John Herschel Glenn, 
Jr., received orders to report to the Space Task Group at Langley Field, on the 
first of May. He then found himself the senior astropilot in age and date of 
rank. From the Navy, Walter Marty Schirra, Jr., and Alan Bartlett Shepard, Jr., 
both lieutenant commanders, and Lieutenant Malcolm Scott Carpenter reported 
aboard STG. And the Air Force assigned three captains, Donald Kent Slayton, 
Leroy Gordon Cooper, Jr., and Virgil I. Grissom, to duty with NASA as test 
pilots, alias Mercury astronauts.
<P>On May 28, 1959, the astronauts were brought before the House Committee on 
Science and Astronautics in executive session. They were asked to reassure the 
Congressmen that they were content with the orderliness, safety, and seriousness 
of Project Mercury. This they did vigorously, together and separately, before 
Schirra mentioned the "seven-sided coin" of competition over which one should 
get the first flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source82"><SUP>82</SUP></A>
<P>The first seven American astronauts were an admirable group of individuals 
chosen to sit at the apex of a pyramid of human effort. In training to transcend 
[165] gravity they became a team of personalities as well as a crew of pilots. 
They were lionized by laymen and adored by youth as heroes before their courage 
was truly tested. In volunteering to entrust their lives to Mercury's spirit and 
Atlas' strength to blaze a trail for man into the empyrean, they chose to lead 
by following the opportunity that chance, circumstance, technology, and history 
had prepared for them. Influential 20th-century philosophers as diverse as 
Bertrand Russell, Teilhard de Chardin, and Walter Kaufmann tell us that man's 
profoundest aspiration is to know himself and his universe and that life's 
deepest passion is a desire to become godlike. All men must balance their hubris 
with their humility, but, as one of those aspiring astronauts said, "How could 
anyone turn down a chance to be a part of something like this?"<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-8.htm#source83"><SUP>83</SUP></A>
<P>Shortly after the astronauts were introduced to the public, a literate layman 
asked directions of Mercury for mankind in general:
<P>
<DL>
  <DT>Which way will heaven be then? 
  <DD>Up?
  <P>Down?
  <P>Across?
  <P>Or far within?<A
