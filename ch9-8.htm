<H1>MR-1A: Suborbital Quality Proven</H1>Early in the morning of December 19, 
winds of 150 knots aloft in the jet stream required a 40-minute hold. During the 
countdown another solenoid valve in the capsule's hydrogen peroxide system had 
to be replaced, necessitating a recycle of the count by one hour. So it was 45 
minutes before noon when the dramatic final 10 seconds of countdown for MR-1A 
occurred. This time there were no fouls. The 83-foot Mercury-Redstone assembly 
was cheered on - "Go! Fly, bird! Go!" - as it lifted off, burning brightly for 
143 seconds to a velocity (slightly high) of 7,120 feet per second at cutoff. 
With this impetus, MR-1A coasted on up to 131 miles, its maximum altitude, then 
nosed over while the bolts in the mating-ring exploded as planned and the 
booster and its payload parted company. The capsule behaved perfectly in its 
attitude control and came down along its predestined trajectory to impact 235 
miles from Cape Canaveral, 18 miles beyond the desired target impact point.
<P>A P2V aircraft pilot saw the capsule descending on its parachute at 4,000 
feet, and about 35 minutes after launch a Marine helicopter from the aircraft 
carrier <I>Valley Forge</I> retrieved the capsule, and returned it secure to the 
flight deck of the carrier within 48 minutes from launch. This time Low elatedly 
reported to Glennan that "the launching was an unqualified success."<A

<P>The Goddard Space Flight Center computers, both men and machines, performed 
admirably in making their first "real-time" impact prediction. On the <I>Valley 
Forge</I> sailors crowded everywhere topside. Visual inspections of the capsule 
by a NASA recovery inspection team revealed no damage except a crack in one 
outer layer of glass in one capsule porthole.
<P>Exuberance was obvious in the postlaunch reports of the various participants. 
Howard C. Kyle, the capsule communicator, said, "Except for a few minor 
discrepancies during the countdown, all equipment appeared to operate normally. 
Technical support was universally superb." Tecwyn Roberts, the flight dynamics 
officer, wrote, "All communications checked A. OK. Data selection loop had some 
noise, but intelligible communication was possible at all times." Henry E. 
Clements, a captain in the Air Force and network status monitor, reported all 
[299] instrumentation "A. OK," with few discrepancies. One note of caution was 
entered by Stanley C. White, the Mercury Control Center flight surgeon: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The acceleration associated with the reentry exceeded by at least 
  1 g the calculated value. If a similar overshoot occurs with the new profile 
  being proposed on future MR flights, we are reaching the point where the 
  astronaut has demonstrated inability to stay alert and to keep up with the 
  events. The consequence of this aberration from predicted should be discussed 
  before the new profile is accepted.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-8.htm#source79"><SUP>79</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Later, 
when the movies from the onboard camera were developed and shown, clean-room 
engineers and workers saw the necessity for still higher standards of 
cleanliness. Washers, nuts, and wire clippings came out from hidden niches and 
floated freely around the cabin during the weightless period. But otherwise, the 
Mercury team felt the pendulum of luck beginning to swing back in their favor at 
the end of 1960. They were proud of the Christmas gift represented by the 
demonstration of suborbital capability of the hardware in MR-1A.
<P>Perhaps the most significant result of the Little Joe 5 and MR-1 failures was 
a profound reexamination among the managers of Project Mercury of their original 
design philosophy. Warren North reported to Silverstein at Headquarters on 
December 6 the results of a series of discussions among field hands on the 
subject of man- machine integration: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the week of November 27, Messrs. Gilruth, Williams, 
  Mathews, Preston, Bland, Ricker, Fields, Roberts and others conducted a major 
  review of the capsule and booster sequence logic in an effort to determine 
  what improvements could be made to prevent incidents such as occurred during 
  Little Joe 5 and MR-1. Also involved in the week long series of discussions at 
  Cape Canaveral were key personnel from McDonnell (including Burke), Convair, 
  Marshall, and Aerospace.
  <P>As a result of operational experience, it was apparent that some of the 
  original design philosophy should be changed, especially insofar as the role 
  of the pilot is concerned. It has become obvious that the complexity of the 
  capsule and booster automatic system is compounded during the integration of 
  the systems. The desirability of avoiding, for manned missions, a direct link 
  between capsule and booster systems, is therefore being studied. For example, 
  the Little Joe-type failure would be averted by the use of an open loop 
  manually controlled abort system. Similarly, the escape tower would not have 
  jettisoned during the MR-1 launch attempt if this had been a manned flight 
  with manual control over the escape rocket and capsule sequence system.<A

the Atlas, the basic vehicle to propel Mercury into orbit, also was undergoing 
its most critical examination. A special ad hoc technical investigating 
committee, established on December 19, 1960, composed of both NASA and Air Force 
personnel, and headed by Richard V. Rhode of NASA Headquarters and Colonel Paul 
E. Worthman of the Ballistic Missile Division, was ordered to investigate the 
reasons why the Atlas had failed so often on NASA launches. Called the 
Rhode-Worthman Committee informally, the dozen members, [300] representing all 
concerned organizations, looked carefully at three recent failures in the 
Atlas-Able series of lunar probes, at MA-1, and even at Big Joe, hoping to 
prevent another fiasco. Since the conferees at the last major coordination 
meeting, on November 16, had issued a test program summary reviewing MA-1 and 
subsequent action, the Rhode-Worthman group began with those inconclusive 
records and a set of 12 agreements on launch conditions for MA-2. Paul Purser 
and Robert E. Vale flew to Los Angeles the day after Christmas to defend STG's 
position on MA-1 and to expedite Convair's construction of a "quick-fix" 
solution for MA-2 and its fabrication of "thick-skin" Atlases for subsequent 
Mercury flights. Other members of the committee distrusted the original design 
for the "quick fix," which was in the form of a "belly band," or girdle, to 
strengthen the interface area around "station 502" on the Atlas booster, where 
the adapter ring for the capsule nested against the lox dome. Later the 
dissenting committee members supported a revised version of the fix after a 
number of their suggestions had been integrated. Both Chamberlin and Yardley had 
suggested the "belly band," but Hohmann disagreed. On December 31, 1960, Purser 
warned Charles Donlan, back at Langley Field, that STG and Convair might be 
overruled by Aerospace, STL, BMD, and NASA Headquarters representatives. As it 
turned out, on the second day of the new year Rhode sent a message to Seamans at 
NASA Headquarters that recommended great caution regarding the decision to 
incorporate the "quick fix," as many of the committee felt that it added 
uncertainty and possibly a new set of hazards. If so, MA-2 might have to wait 
three to six months more for a "thick-skin" Atlas from the factory.<A

<P>The year 1960 ended in suspense for the Mercury team. The Soviet attempt on 
December 1-2, 1960, to orbit and retrieve two more dogs from space had, as the 
Soviets admitted, ended in cremation for "Pchelka" and "Mushka" when their 
attitude control system failed at retrofire and their vehicle, <I>Korabl Sputnik 
III</I>, burned up on reentry from its rather too shallow orbit. To appraise the 
meaning of the flight of the Soviets' third man-sized spaceship from available 
information was exceedingly difficult. Obviously the Soviets were close to the 
day when they could put a man into orbit, but the similar failures of their 
first and third "cosmic ships," on May 19 and December 2, respectively, had made 
the question "How close?" highly debatable.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-8.htm#source82"><SUP>82</SUP></A>
<P>On December 5, a member of the Soviet Academy of Science, G. Pokrovsky, had 
extolled the "socialist system," in spite of its failure to recover Pchelka and 
Mushka, and boasted that "we are on the threshold of manned space flight, and 
the first man to be in space will undoubtedly be a Soviet citizen." That same 
day, <I>Time</I> magazine had bemoaned "Lead-Footed Mercury" and ridiculed 
Wernher von Braun's calling MR-1 "a little mishap": "Project Mercury's latest 
failure, third in a row, just about evaporated the last faint wisp of hope that 
the U.S. might put a man into space before Russia does." A <I>New York Times</I> 
editorial agreed with that evaluation and advised the new President-elect to 
persevere: "The first man in space will not be the last, and after the tributes 
have been paid to that first man and those who made his feat possible the more 
important question will arise of what man can do in space that is worth the 
immense cost of putting him there."<A

<P>Although there was some exultation in the United States after the success of 
MR-1A on December 19, the public seemed to sense, without any deep 
understanding, a difference of several orders of magnitude between Soviet space 
flight tests and American qualification flight difficulties. Within the Space 
Task Group, NASA, and the Mercury team, technical understanding, sometimes 
divorced from political intuition, appeared to buttress the hope that an 
American manned ballistic flight into space might still precede the 
substantially more difficult manned orbital flight around Earth. Manned space 
flight was a name for a series of field events in the space olympics. Although 
the odds were with the Soviets to win the marathon of the first orbital 
circumnavigation, perhaps Mercury might win the suborbital sprint.

<P><A name=source80><SUP>80</SUP></A> Memo, North to Dir., Space Flight 
Programs, "Mercury Capsule Changes and Flight Schedule," Dec. 6, 1960:
<P>"Open loop operation of the Abort Sensing and Implementation System (ASIS) is 
a change which does not detract from the effectivity of the system. This change, 
in fact, makes the system more reliable and effective because a pilot who is 
placed in the control loop has the ability to assess whether a true abort 
situation exists. In this concept, the pilot would get a red light indication 
that an abort is called for but would manually activate the escape sequence. The 
inherent aerodynamic stability and high structural strength of the Redstone 
should provide a sufficient time constant between capsule abort light indication 
and time for abort decision. The pilot, after observing the abort light, can 
either immediately abort, if he is in a critical flight regime, or he can rely 
on secondary cues such as changes in acceleration, changes in attitude, and 
radio voice transmissions from visual observers or telemeter monitors. Although 
it is reasonably clear that the Redstone should be flown with an open loop ASIS, 
the Atlas operational procedure is not yet resolved because allowable pilot 
reaction time will be somewhat less. I feel, however, that experience with the 
manned Redstone will convince us that the manned Atlas should also be flown open 
loop. Incidentally, three Atlas ASIS systems have been flown open loop to date; 
two would have caused inadvertent aborts."
