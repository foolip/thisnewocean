<H1>Mercury Orbits at Last</H1>On launch day, September 13, the cloud coverage 
was scattered; visibility was 9 miles; the wind velocity was about 11 miles per 
hour; and the temperature was 78 degrees. Ninety minutes before launch time a 
half-hour hold was called to replace a broken screw in one of the afterbody 
shingles. The liquid oxygen was loaded by 8:30 a.m., and 5 minutes later the 
operations crew determined that all systems were go. At 8:57, however, the 
low-speed data timing was momentarily lost at the Bermuda tracking site, and the 
countdown was recycled to T minus 3 minutes and 30 seconds.
<P>A little after 9:04 a.m. on September 13, 1961, MA-4 was launched on its 
one-orbit mission. During the first 20 seconds from liftoff, fairly severe 
booster vibrations were detected by the flight dynamics officer in the Control 
Center. The "thick-skin" Atlas passed its max-q test. At the 52-second point, a 
spacecraft inverter that was converting electrical power from direct to 
alternating current failed, but the standby inverter switched on automatically. 
Guidance data soon disclosed that the trajectory was .75-degree high; later, at 
engine cutoff, it was .14-degree low. Although booster engine cutoff occurred 
2.5 seconds early, booster velocity was about 100 feet per second too high. Then 
the sustainer engine cut off 10 seconds early, so the desired velocity was 
essentially achieved. [387] Despite these dispersions, which were within design 
limits, perigee and apogee of the orbit were only slightly more than a mile and 
12 miles, respectively, below plan. The Goddard computers instantly indicated a 
go for the mission. The powered phase, plus posigrade rocket increment, provided 
a peak velocity of 25,705 feet per second; g loads during the powered phase 
reached a peak of 7.6.<A

<P>Despite a slight disturbance in the roll, pitch, and yaw of the booster, 
separation occurred properly, and after a 5-second steadying or damping period 
the capsule began its turnaround maneuver. Soon, however, large attitude 
excursions were observed, and the spacecraft took 50 seconds to reverse its ends 
to heatshield forward, as opposed to a normal 20 seconds, using 9.5 pounds of 
hydrogen peroxide attitude control fuel against the 2.2 pounds supposedly 
required. Even with the abnormal turnaround, the spacecraft attitude gyros and 
scanners soon transmitted nominal readings, and there seemed no doubt that the 
mission would proceed to its orbital conclusion. The cause of these undue 
excursions later was found to be an open electrical connection in the pitch- 
rate gyro.<A

<P>A high oxygen usage rate like that on Grissom's suborbital mission cropped up 
early and continued throughout the flight. At the 27,000-foot point the system 
sealed off at 5.5 pounds per square inch; then an abrupt drop was indicated in 
the primary oxygen supply and a concurrent rise in cabin and suit pressure 
values to 6 pounds per square inch. "Primary oxygen going down fast," Paul E. 
Purser jotted in his notes as he listened to the communications circuit. 
"Zanzibar reported 30 percent of primary oxygen left," he later added. Toward 
the end of the mission, with the primary supply depleted, the system switched 
over to secondary. Usage from this source was so slight, however, that Walter 
Williams commenting on the high usage problem in a press conference following 
the mission, said that the secondary supply was virtually untouched. Throughout 
the flight the crewman simulator continued to use oxygen to produce moisture and 
carbon dioxide, and to monitor the operations while recording heat and suit 
pressure changes.<A

<P>Despite the abnormalities with the oxygen supply, once the automated Mercury 
spacecraft was on its orbital course, the computers indicated that the mission 
could go for more than seven orbits. In general, the control systems operated 
well, although on three occasions the spacecraft dropped out of its 34-degree, 
Earth-reference mode, once just before the ignition of the retrorockets and 
twice just before the .05-g light telemetry signal. These attitude variations 
came from the failure of a one-pound yaw-positive thruster and a one-pound 
roll-negative thruster.
<P>Communications between the capsule and the tracking stations were good, 
especially on high frequencies, which on the earlier suborbital flights had been 
virtually unsuccessful. In some cases radar tracking was not good, largely 
because a few of the operators lacked experience. Telemetry reception was 
excellent, with some 137 observations received by the various tracking stations 
during the flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-2.htm#source15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>[389] One hour, 28 minutes, and 59 seconds after MA-4's liftoff, the first 
retrorocket fired in the vicinity of Hawaii. Monitors at the Guaymas station in 
Mexico indicated that retrofire, triggered by the spacecraft clock, had gone off 
as planned. Within the range of the Cape Canaveral control center, telemetry 
data disclosed that MA-4 was in the proper reentry attitude. Over the Atlantic 
the drogue parachute opened at 41,750 feet, and the main chute deployed at 
10,050 feet. At 10:55 a.m. the capsule splashed down 176 miles east of Bermuda. 
After an hour and 22 minutes, the destroyer <I>Decatur</I>, which had been about 
34 miles from the impact point, pulled alongside the spacecraft and hoisted it 
aboard. From there the capsule and its robot "astronaut" rode to Bermuda, whence 
they were airlifted to the Cape for an exhaustive examination.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-2.htm#source16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
<P>The cause of the oxygen supply malfunction was immediately attacked by the 
STG and McDonnell engineers. Onboard film, they found, disclosed that the oxygen 
supply emergency light had blinked on, which would have signaled an astronaut to 
take corrective action. The inspectors also learned that vibration had dislodged 
the rate handle from its detent, allowing a valve to crack open. But the flow 
rate had not been sufficient to trip the microswitch that would have given the 
Mercury Control Center a telemetry indication of an emergency rate actuation 
while the mission was in progress. Normally a force of from three to eight 
pounds was needed to break the handle free from the detent, whereas in this case 
the inspectors moved the handle with very little force. A new emergency rate 
handle with a positive latching mechanism was to be devised for later 
missions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-2.htm#source17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>Other postflight analyses by the engineers found the MA-4 spacecraft and its 
systems in good condition. There was no afterbody shingle buckling or warping, 
and the structural materials were only mildly discolored. The horizon scanner 
window was partially coated with a film of oxidized material caused by 
aerodynamic heating. Some internal debris, including solder balls and washers, 
had apparently escaped preflight tumbling and vacuum cleaning. Six buckled skin 
panels between the base ring and the lower pressure bulkhead indicated that the 
capsule landed with the heatshield edge striking the water first. Still the 
inspectors concluded that the structural damage was not enough to have 
endangered an astronaut. The center section of the heatshield was partially 
delaminated and the center plug was loose, conditions apparently caused by water 
impact and cooling. Two cracks were found on the shield in the vicinity of the 
water-impact point. The depth of the char on the ablation shield was very 
shallow.<A

<P>NASA officials showed their pleasure at the success of MA—4 at the press 
conference held at the Cape immediately after the flight. Gilruth pointed out 
that this had been the hardest test flight in the whole NASA program. He added 
that the Atlas had demonstrated that it was capable of boosting a man into 
orbit, as he, Maxime A. Faget, Purser, and others from NACA-Langley days had 
long believed. Without hesitation Gilruth concluded that a man would have 
survived the flight.
<P>[390] At that point a reporter asked whether a man would fly the next Mercury 
orbital mission. Walter Williams answered that a three- orbit circuit, either 
unmanned or carrying a chimpanzee, was still necessary. Then why was the 
upcoming Mercury-Scout mission necessary, asked a newsman. Again Williams 
affirmed his confidence in the wisdom of the agreed-upon schedule of flights.<A

"Postlaunch Report on Test 1254," Sept. 15, 1961; Purser, penciled notes on MA—4 
countdown and flight, Sept. 13, 1961; memo, Walter J. Kapryan, Capsule Systems 
Monitor, to Flight Dir., "Report on Test 1254," Sept. 29, 1961; memo, Tecwyn 
Roberts to Flight Dir., "Report on Test 1254," Sept. 25, 1961. Countdown 
procedures for MA-4 resembled those of the Mercury-Redstone missions. They were 
conducted in a 500-minute split-count with a 12- to 14-hour hold at T minus 300 
for peroxide and pyrotechnics servicing. When the MA-4 count began Sept. 12 the 
operations crew feared that hurricane "Debbie" might adversely affect the 
recovery area, but the count proceeded to T minus 300. At 4 p.m. a weather 
review found conditions improving, so hydrogen peroxide servicing was begun. The 
count resumed at 2 a.m., Sept. 13. Weather reviews and a peroxide check, plus 
the problems described in the text, accounted for holds totaling 2 hours and 4 
minutes during countdown.

oxygen out of the environmental control system, emitted carbon dioxide, 
simulated minor suit leakage of oxygen, and initiated dumping. NASA News Release

Slayton to Bermuda. Glenn, Grissom, and Shepard were in the control center at 
Cape Canaveral, with Shepard serving as Capsule Communicator. (Message, STG to 
NASA Hq., Sept. 9, 1961.) This was the first time that the automatic 
stabilization and control system, the reaction control system, and the horizon 
scanner subsystem could be fully evaluated for orbital missions. The mission 
proved that the attitude control system was adequate for reentry.

M. Low to NASA Administrator, "Preliminary Results of MA-4 Flight," Sept. 15, 
1961. R/A John L. Chew, commanding Destroyer Flotilla Four, said at the Cape 
press conference following the flight that the seas were running only about a 
foot high in the recovery area - which meant that hurricane Debbie was 
ineffective in those waters. During the spacecraft's descent, a C-54 aircraft 
sighted its reentry contrails, shortly thereafter noted deployment of the main 
parachute, and finally observed water impact. Pickup by the destroyer 
<I>Decatur</I> was effected at 12:15 p.m. The main chute and the antenna fairing 
were retrieved about 1,000 yards from the spacecraft. All spacecraft recovery 
aids performed well with the exception of the radar chaff. "Postlaunch Report
