<H1>Multiple G</H1>Another problem perplexing aeromedical experts as the era of 
space flight neared was the effect on the human body of the heavy acceleration 
and deceleration forces, called "g loads," building up during rocket-propelled 
flights into space at speeds far greater than those yet experienced by man. Many 
fighter pilots in the Second World War had suffered momentary pain and blurred 
vision during "redout," when blood pooled in the head and eyes during an outside 
loop, or "blackout," when the heart suddenly could not pump enough blood to the 
head region as an airplane pulled out of a steep dive. Acceleration of a vehicle 
into space and the deceleration accompanying its return to the atmosphere would 
subject a man to g loads several times the normal accelerative force of gravity. 
In other words, for parts of a space mission a man would come to "weigh" several 
times what he normally did on Earth; a severe strain would be imposed on his 
body organs.
<P>At the Aeromedical Field Laboratory in New Mexico, Harald J. von Beckh, a 
physician who had immigrated from Germany by way of the Instituto Nacional de 
Medicina Aeronáutica in Buenos Aires, was especially concerned about the ability 
of a space traveler to tolerate the high deceleration forces of atmospheric 
entry after several hours of weightlessness. In the last few months before such 
[40] research ended at Holloman, von Beckh inquired into the relationship 
between zero g and the multiplication of g. He added a steep downward spiral to 
the level, weightless portion of the Keplerian trajectory in order to impose 
heavy g loads on a test subject immediately after a half minute or so of 
weightlessness. After a number of these parabolic-spiral flights, he reported 
pessimistically, "Alternation of weightlessness and acceleration results in a 
decrease of acceleration tolerance and of the efficiency of physiologic recovery 
mechanisms . . . Because there is a decreased acceleration tolerance," he 
warned, "every effort must be made to reduce G loads to a minimum."<A

<P>Throughout the 1950s a substantial number of aeromedical experts concerned 
themselves with acceleration-deceleration loads per se, not necessarily in 
connection with the gravity-free state. Research on g forces reached back for 
decades, to the primitive period of aviation medicine. The state of knowledge 
with regard to the physiology of acceleration-deceleration was still hazy and 
fluid in the early fifties, although for at least 25 years aviation physicians 
in Europe and the United States had been studying blackout, redout, impact 
forces, and other effects of high g in aircraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> 
The V-2 and Aerobee animal rocket shots also had added to research data on the 
problem. But until the X-15 was ready, researchers had about exhausted the 
airplane as a tool for studying g loads, and from 1952 to 1958 experimentation 
with animal-carrying rockets was suspended in the United States. Consequently 
American scientists had to turn to two devices on the ground - the 
rocket-powered impact sled, used for studying the immediate onset of g loads, 
and the centrifuge, where the slower buildup of g could be simulated - to 
enlarge what they knew about the limits of human endurance of heavy acceleration 
and deceleration.
<P>On December 10, 1954, Lieutenant Colonel John P. Stapp of the Aeromedical 
Field Laboratory gave an amazing demonstration of a man's ability to withstand 
immediate impact forces. Stapp rode a rocket-driven impact sled on the 
3,550-foot Holloman research track to a velocity of 937 feet per second and 
received an impact force of 35 to 40 g for a fraction of a second as the sled 
slammed to a halt in a water trough.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> 
In February 1957 a chimpanzee rocketed down the track, now 5,000 feet long, 
braked to a stop, and survived a load of some 247 g for a millisecond, with a 
rate of onset of 16,000 g per second. And 15 months later, on the 120-foot 
"daisy track" at Holloman, Captain Eli L. Beeding, seated upright and facing 
backward, experienced the highest deceleration peak yet recorded on a human 
being - 83 g for .04 of a second, with 3,826 g per second as the calculated rate 
of onset. Afterward Beeding, recovering from shock and various minor injuries, 
judged that 83 g represented about the limit of human tolerance for 
deceleration.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
<P>Such studies of deceleration were not directed primarily toward space 
missions but rather toward the problem of survival after ejection from or 
crashes in high-performance aircraft. The Holloman sled runs of the fifties, 
however, did broaden considerably the available data on the absolute limits of 
man's ability [41] to endure multiples of g. And, perhaps more important, the 
New Mexico experiments in biodynamics were directly applicable to the problem of 
high g forces resulting from the uncushioned impact of a spacecraft on water or 
land. Stapp reasoned that a properly restrained, aft-facing human being could 
withstand a land impact of some 80 knots (135 feet per second) in a spacecraft 
if the g forces were applied transversely, or through the body, and if the 
spacecraft did not collapse on him.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>The centrifuge, the other laboratory tool used by students of 
acceleration-deceleration patterns, became increasingly useful in the fifties. 
The basic feature of the centrifuge was a large mechanical arm with a 
man-carrying gondola or platform mounted on the end, within which a test subject 
would be rotated at high angular velocities. Centrifuge experiments had more 
immediate pertinence to space medicine than impact sled tests, because on the 
"wheel" investigators could duplicate the relatively gradual buildup of g forces 
encountered during the launch and reentry portions of ballistic, orbital, or 
interplanetary flight. In the fifties, centrifuges existed at several places in 
the United States. The best-known and most used were at the Navy's Aviation 
Medical Acceleration Laboratory, Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and at the 
Aeromedical Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. During the decade, 
researchers at Johnsville, Wright-Patterson, and elsewhere simulated a wide 
variety of acceleration and deceleration profiles, using an almost equally wide 
variety of body positions and support systems, to compile an impressive quantity 
of data on the reactions of potential space pilots to heavy g forces.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<P>Just after the Second World War, Otto Gauer and Heinz Haber, who had 
conducted centrifuge experiments for the German Air Force, proposed a series of 
acceleration patterns, ranging from 3 g for 9½ minutes to 10 g for 2 minutes, 
all of which would be tolerable for a space pilot.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> 
Then, in 1952, E. R. Ballinger, leader of the research program at 
Wright-Patterson, conducted one of the earliest series of centrifuge tests 
directed expressly toward the problem of g forces in space flight. Ballinger 
found that 3 g applied transversely would be the ideal takeoff pattern from the 
physiological standpoint, but he realized that the rocket burning time and 
velocity for such a pattern would be insufficient to propel a spacecraft out of 
the atmosphere. Consequently he and his associates subjected men to gradually 
increasing g loads, building to peaks of 10 g for something over two minutes. 
Chest pain, shortness of breath, and occasional loss of consciousness were the 
symptoms of those subjected to the higher g loads. The tests led Ballinger to 
the conclusion that 8 g represented the acceleration safety limit for a space 
passenger.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>Data gained from the first Soviet and American instrumented satellites of 
late 1957 and early 1958 showed that the atmosphere reached considerably farther 
out than scientists previously had realized. Until these disclosures aeromedical 
experts had assumed that the deceleration, or backward acceleration, forces of 
reentry, producing what was graphically described as an "eyeballs out" 
sensation, [42] would be much greater than the acceleration during the ascent, 
or "eyeballs in," phase of the mission. Proceeding on this assumption, a team of 
physiologists from the Army, Navy, and Air Force had used the 50-foot centrifuge 
at the Navy's Johnsville installation to study the anticipated high reentry g 
buildup, exposing five chimpanzees to a peak of 40 g for one minute. Post-run 
examinations of the primates showed internal injuries, including heart 
malfunctions. It appeared that prolonged subjection to high g might be severely 
injurious or perhaps even fatal to a man.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
<P>The tests conducted by Ballinger at Wright-Patterson and the interservice 
experiments with the chimpanzees on the Navy centrifuge featured frontward 
(eyeballs-in) application of g loads during the launch profile, backward 
application (eyeballs-out) during the reentry simulation, and the use of rather 
elaborate restraint straps and basic aircraft bucket seats as a support system. 
The problem of determining optimum body position and support was vigorously 
attacked by biodynamicists during 1957 and 1958. A series of especially careful 
studies on the Wright Air Development Center centrifuge indicated that when the 
subject was positioned so that the g forces were applied transversely and 
backward to the center of rotation, breathing became easier. 
Acceleration-deceleration patterns of 12 g for 4 seconds, 8 g for 41 seconds, 
and 5 g for 2 minutes were endured without great difficulty by practically all 
the volunteer subjects, some having even higher tolerance limits. Results of 
runs on the Johnsville centrifuge with the subjects in an aft-facing position 
for both acceleration and deceleration patterns also appeared favorable.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
<P>The students of g forces tried various support devices in the late fifties in 
their search for ways to increase human tolerance to acceleration and 
deceleration loads. One specialist in the Wright-Patterson centrifuge group came 
up with a suit of interwoven nylon and cotton material, reinforced by nylon 
belting, and attached to the pilot seat at six places to absorb the g loads and 
distribute them more evenly over the entire body. Later, Wright-Patterson 
scientists using a nylon netting arrangement in conjunction with a contour couch 
were able to expose several men to a peak of 16.5 g for several seconds without 
any discoverable adverse effects. Other Air Force specialists experimented with 
subjects partially enclosed in a "rigid envelope," actually a plaster cast, as 
protection against both g-load buildup and impact forces. And von Beckh, whose 
concern with the weightlessness-deceleration puzzle led him to experiment with 
anti-g techniques, developed a device called "multi-directional g protection," a 
compartment that turned automatically to ensure that the g forces were always 
applied transversely on its occupant. Von Beckh's invention was used to protect 
a rat that went along on Beeding's record sled run in 1958, and a modified 
compartment carried three mice on a Thor-Able rocket launch the same year. 
Results in both experiments were encouraging.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>Navy scientists were especially interested in water immersion as a means of 
minimizing g loads. Researchers in Germany, Canada, and the United States [43] 
had experimented with water-lined flying suits and submersion in water tanks, 
beginning in the 1930s. Specialists had carried out sporadic biodynamic tests 
with immersed rabbits and mice in the late forties at the Navy School of 
Aviation Medicine and, after the giant centrifuge began operation in 1952, in 
Johnsville.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>In 1956, R. Flanagan Gray, a physician at the Johnsville laboratory, designed 
an aluminum centrifuge capsule that could be filled with water and was large 
enough to hold a man. After some initial troubles installing the contraption on 
the centrifuge and perfecting an emergency automatic flushing mechanism, the 
"Iron Maiden," as it was rather inaccurately nicknamed, went into use. In March 
1958, Gray, immersed to his ribs in a bathtub-like device developed at the Mayo 
Clinic during the Second World War, had endured 16 g of headward (head to feet) 
acceleration. Then, the next year, Gray enclosed himself in the Iron Maiden and, 
positioned backward to the center of rotation and immersed in water above the 
top of his head, held his breath during the 25-second pattern to withstand a 
peak of 31 g transverse acceleration for five seconds. This performance with the 
water-filled aluminum capsule established a new record for tolerance of 
centrifuge g loads.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>Nylon netting, multidirectional positioning, and water immersion were all 
promising methods for combating g forces and expanding human endurance limits. 
But netting had a troublesome tendency to bounce the subject forward as the g 
forces diminished, while directional positioning and water-immersion apparatus 
required more space and weight than would be available in a small, relatively 
light spacecraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> 
And considering the thrust limitations of the Thor, the Atlas, or the somewhat 
larger Titan ICBM, a small spacecraft was the only feasible design for an 
American manned satellite in 1958.
<P>At the inception of the NASA manned satellite project, in the fall of 1958, 
the apparent solution to the problem of body support was an anti-g contrivance 
developed not by biodynamicists but by a group of practicing aerodynamicists in 
NACA's Pilotless Aircraft Research Division, part of the Langley Aeronautical 
Laboratory in Virginia. Maxime A. Faget, William M. Bland, Jr., Jack C. 
Heberlig, and a few other NACA engineers had designed an extremely strong and 
lightweight couch, made of fiber glass, which could be contoured to fit the body 
dimensions of a particular man. In the spring of 1958, technicians and shopmen 
at Langley molded the first of a series of test-model contour couches. The 
following July a group from Langley went to the Aviation Medical Acceleration 
Laboratory at Johnsville to try out their couch on the Navy's big centrifuge.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>The Navy biodynamicists and the NACA engineers experimented with the couch 
and various body positions in an effort to amplify a g-load tolerance. The couch 
made at Langley had been molded to fit the physical dimensions of Robert A. 
Champine, one of the foremost NACA test pilots. Champine rode the Johnsville 
centrifuge to a peak of 12 g on July 29, then departed for a conference on the 
Pacific Coast. The next day Navy Lieutenant Carter C. Collins volunteered to 
test the couch. Since his frame was smaller than Champine's, the Johnsville [46] 
experts had to pack foam-rubber padding into the recesses of the fiber-glass 
bed. Collins then climbed into the centrifuge gondola and seated himself in the 
couch, the back angle of which was set forward 10 degrees. The 4,000-horsepower 
centrifuge motor whirled the gondola progressively faster. On the first run the 
loads reached a peak of 12 g. Five more runs pushed the peak to 18 g. Then, on 
the sixth try, using a grunting technique to avoid blackout and chest pains, 
Collins withstood a peak of 20.7 g, applied transversely for a duration of six 
seconds. Later that day, Gray, inventor of the Iron Maiden, rode the centrifuge 
with the contour couch and also endured a 20-g peak. The acceleration patterns 
to which Collins and Gray were exposed corresponded to a reentry angle of 7.5 
degrees. At that time the optimum reentry angle being considered for a manned 
satellite, 1.5 degrees, theoretically would expose the spacecraft passenger to 
only 9 g.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>The NACA engineers, already working overtime on designs for a manned orbital 
capsule, were elated. It seemed that they finally had an effective anti-g device 
that was small enough and light enough to fit into a one-ton ballistic capsule 
they had in mind for the initial manned space venture.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-4.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> 
They had, in fact, made a major contribution to the protection of a space rider 
from sustained high g forces, although they did not fully realize as yet that 
body angles were more significant features of the couch than its contoured 
support.
<P>The procedure ultimately used for protecting the Mercury astronauts from the 
g loads of acceleration to orbital velocity and deceleration during reentry 
represented a combination of the advantages gained from many experiments by 
military and other specialists in flight physiology, as well as from the 
ingenuity of the aeronautical engineers in NACA and NASA. Although the idea of 
using a hammock either for the basic support or in combination with the contour 
couch was perennially attractive to the human-factors experts in Project 
Mercury, all Mercury astronauts sat in essentially the same couch designed by 
Faget and his coworkers in the spring of 1958. But added to this basic technique 
were restraining straps, a semi-supine posture, frontward application of 
acceleration loads, and the reversal of the spacecraft attitude during orbit to 
permit frontward imposition of reentry loads as well. The final elements in the 
NACA-NASA campaign to minimize the effects of insertion-reentry g buildups was 
the use as astronauts of experienced test pilots provided by the military 
services. During the centrifuge experiments of the fifties such men had 
consistently proved capable of withstanding higher g forces than nonpilots.
