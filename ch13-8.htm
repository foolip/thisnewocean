<H1>MA-7 Preparations</H1>[443] One would have expected, in keeping with the 
"backup" concept, that Schirra, the MA-7 alternate pilot, now would step in as 
prime astronaut. But in view of the numerous delays and consequent lengthy 
training preparations for MA-6, Williams, as the operations team leader, 
recommended to Gilruth that Carpenter, Glenn's backup pilot, was most primed for 
the upcoming mission. Carpenter had logged 79 1/2 hours of preflight checkout 
and training time in Glenn's <I>Friendship 7</I>, more than twice the 31½ hours 
he would spend in his own <I>Aurora 7</I> for the same purposes.<A

<P>Although Glenn's mission had been highly successful, the Mercury operations 
team was still in the learning process. Experience with a component in the 
Mercury capsule or a flight procedure during the MA-6 orbital flight served to 
guide MA-7 mission planning. Glenn had shown that man definitely could be more 
than just a passenger, so the MSC planners adjusted the MA-7 flight plan to 
allow more pilot control of the mission. Combined yaw-roll maneuvers were 
scheduled to permit observation of the sunrise, as well as maneuvers to 
determine the use of day and night horizons, landmarks, and stars as navigation 
references. One of the more interesting planned innovations for Carpenter's 
voyage involved a period of inverted flight (head toward Earth) to determine the 
effect of Earth-up and sky-down on pilot orientation. Flight planners recognized 
the need for perceptual reorientation in space flight as well as for the motor 
skills that had been demonstrated so well by Glenn. The next Mercury mission 
ought to be as much of a scientific experiment as possible, not only to 
corroborate MA-6 but also to explore new possibilities with the manned Mercury 
spacecraft.<A

<P>Since Glenn had been able to respond to many of the scientific astronomical 
observation requests, Homer Newell, who had been Director of NASA's Office of 
Space Sciences since November 1, 1961, decided that the direction of the 
scientific portion of the manned space flight program should now become the 
responsibility of a formal committee. Jocelyn Gill again was chosen to serve as 
chairman of a group called the Ad Hoc Committee on Scientific Tasks and Training 
for Man-in-Space. Two days after receiving the mandate, Dr. Gill called a 
meeting of members, consisting of representatives from the various scientific 
disciplines, on March 16, 1962, to outline objectives, review past activities in 
this respect, present a preliminary analysis of the scientific debriefing of 
Glenn, and outline tasks and goals for the next meeting. One of the aims of the 
new committee was to devise a curriculum that would provide the astronauts with 
the best informational sources available about the spatial phenomena they might 
see. In addition to this, they proceeded to suggest several experiments to the 
Manned Spacecraft Center.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-8.htm#source67"><SUP>67</A></SUP>
<P>So without jeopardizing either pilot safety or mission success, the MA-7 
flight would be designed to yield as much scientific, as opposed to engineering, 
information as possible. Kleinknecht, head of the MSC Mercury Project Office, 
[444] named Lewis R. Fisher chairman of the Mercury Scientific Experiments 
Panel, as a parallel to the NASA Headquarters unit, to manage and arrange for 
the experiments being suggested. Fisher and his associates were charged with 
reviewing all proposed experiments from an engineering feasibility standpoint in 
terms of their scientific value, relative priority, and suitability for orbital 
flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-8.htm#source68"><SUP>68</A></SUP>
<P>The Fisher panel first met at Cape Canaveral on April 24, 1962, and decided 
to emphasize five suggested experiments: releasing a multi-colored balloon that 
would remain tethered to the capsule, observing the behavior of liquid in a 
weightless state inside a closed glass bottle, using a special light meter to 
determine the visibility of a ground flare, making weather photographs with 
hand-held cameras, and studying the airglow layer - for which Carpenter would 
receive special training. The tethered balloon was a 30-inch mylar inflatable 
sphere, which was folded, packaged, and housed with its gas expansion bottle in 
the antenna canister. The whole balloon package weighed two pounds. Divided into 
five sections of different colors - uncolored aluminum, yellow, orange, white, 
and a phosphorescent coating that appeared white by day and blue by night - the 
balloon was to be cast off near perigee after the first orbital pass to float 
freely at the end of a 100-foot nylon line. The purposes of the balloon 
experiment were to study the effects of space on the reflection properties of 
colored surfaces through visual observation and photographic studies and to 
obtain aerodynamic drag measurements by use of a strain gauge.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-8.htm#source69"><SUP>69</A></SUP>
<P>Some experimentation on the effects of reduced gravity on liquids previously 
had been conducted at Holloman Air Force Base, at the Air Force School of 
Aviation Medicine in San Antonio, and at the Lewis Research Center. But the 
duration of these experiments, involving parabolic airplane flights and 
drop-tower tests, had been necessarily short. Results of an extended study would 
have both immediate and long-range implications in manned space flight 
operations. Already the problem of gas or fuel vapor ullage in space vehicles 
and in storage tanks was causing some difficulties, and later there would be 
related problems in orbital rendezvous fuel transfer. Before fuel tanks and 
pumps for extended use in space could be designed, the behavior of surface 
tension and capillary action of liquids in the weightless state had to be 
determined. For this experiment the Lewis Center provided a small glass sphere 
containing a capillary tube with tiny semicircular holes at the bottom of the 
open tube. The sphere, only 20 percent filled, contained 60 milliliters of a 
mixture of distilled water, green dye, aerosol solution, and silicone. The 
liquid had a surface tension of 32 dynes per centimeter on Earth.
<P>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology requested photographs of the 
daylight horizon through blue and red filters to define more precisely the 
Earth-horizon limb as seen from above the atmosphere. These findings would be 
particularly valuable for navigation studies in the Apollo program. The Weather 
Bureau wanted information on the best wavelengths for meteorological satellite 
photography. John A. O'Keefe and Jocelyn Gill at the Goddard Space Flight Center 
[445] and NASA Headquarters, respectively, wanted a distance measurement of the 
airglow layer above the horizon, its angular width, and a description of its 
characteristics, and for this experiment Carpenter was provided with a 
photometer and trained to use it. Paul D. Lowman, also of Goddard, requested 
special photography of the North American and African land masses. Lowman's 
interest was based on his studies of planetary surfaces, particularly regarding 
meteoroid impact features.<A

<P>A number of technical changes based on MA-6 mission results were made for 
MA-7, mostly involving deletions of certain equipment from the spacecraft to 
reduce weight. Kleinknecht's office eliminated the sofar bombs and radar chaff 
recovery aids, which seemed unnecessary in view of the effectiveness that had 
been demonstrated by the sarah beacon and dye markers. Other deletions included 
the knee and chest straps on the couch, which had bothered Grissom; the red 
filter in the window; the moderately heavy Earth-path indicator; and the 
instrument panel camera, which had already gathered sufficient data.
<P>Modifications made to improve spacecraft, network, and astronaut performance 
included a radio frequency change in the telemetry system to eradicate 
transmission interference like that experienced on Glenn's flight. The two 
landing-bag switches were rewired so that both had to be closed to activate the 
deploy signal. To correct temporarily the control problem experienced by Glenn, 
Karl F. Greil of the Mercury Project Office studied masses of data and concluded 
that the problem lay in the fuel line filters. So the dutch-weave filters in the 
fuel lines were replaced with platinum screens, and a stainless-steel fuel line 
was substituted. This was intended as an "interim fix," but it became permanent 
in the Mercury project for the later flights. Even the astronaut's attire 
underwent some modifications. Pockets were added on the upper sleeves and on the 
lower legs of the pressure suit for pencils, a handkerchief, and other small 
accessories. And the waterwing life vest, first carried by Glenn, was installed 
on the chest beneath the parabolic mirror. To add to Carpenter's comfort while 
he was waiting in his capsule on the launch pad, a new and more resilient liner 
was fitted in the couch.<A

<P>The three principal components of the MA-7 mission - spacecraft, launch 
rocket, and astronaut - were in preparation for several months. Spacecraft No. 
18 was the first of these to reach the Cape, arriving on November 15, 1961. 
During its long checkout period by G. Merritt Preston's crew, this vehicle was 
reworked twice to incorporate lessons learned during MA-5 and MA-6. Some 
equipment and systems in the capsule had to be exchanged because what it had 
carried to Florida simply did not work properly. The original periscope, for 
example, failed to latch in the retracted position. Glenn's drogue parachute 
mortar supposedly had fired before the pilot triggered its button; the McDonnell 
engineers decided that a barostat in the recovery arming circuit should prevent 
another premature action. Since there still were questions concerning the 
temperature at different places on the capsule while it was in orbit, a device 
known as a [446] "low-level commutator" was added, and temperature pickups were 
strategically located at 28 points on the spacecraft to record temperature data 
on a tape recorder carried on board.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-8.htm#source72"><SUP>72</A></SUP>
<P>When in March he learned that he would fly spacecraft No. 18, Scott Carpenter 
named his capsule <I>Aurora 7</I>. He chose this name deliberately, "Because I 
think of Project Mercury and the open manner in which we are conducting it for 
the benefit of all as a light in the sky. Aurora also means dawn - in this case 
the dawn of a new age. The 7, of course, stands for the original seven 
astronauts." Coincidentally, the astronaut as a boy had lived at the corner of 
Aurora and Seventh Avenues in Boulder, Colorado.
<P>The Atlas, the astronaut, and the ground support personnel entered into their 
final preparatory phase in March 1962. On March 8, six days after the Air Force 
accepted it at the rollout inspection at the Convair factory in San Diego, Atlas 
107-D arrived at the Cape and was erected on the pad. Since the previous Atlas 
had performed well in boosting Glenn into orbit and since the MA-7 launch 
requirements were to duplicate those of MA-6, few changes were necessary for 
107-D. One alteration was a slight reduction in the staging time, from 131.3 to 
130.1 seconds after liftoff, to improve the launch vehicle's ability to reach 
the precise center of the insertion "window."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-8.htm#source73"><SUP>73</A></SUP> 
Intensive training for the astronaut, his backup, and the tracking teams on the 
MA-7 mission began on March 16. Mission simulations, flight controller training, 
and an exercise of the Defense Department recovery forces proceeded much as they 
had for MA-6. The Atlantic tracking ship, however, was not on station for MA-7 
because she was at a Baltimore shipyard, being converted into a command ship to 
support the longer duration Mercury missions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-8.htm#source74"><SUP>74</A></SUP>
<P>At the time of Glenn's flight, the launch of MA-7 had been scheduled for the 
second week in April, but the installation of new components, such as the 
temperature survey instrumentation and the barostat in the drogue parachute 
circuit, as well as other work, delayed the launching until May. Also 
contributing to the postponement was an Atlantic Fleet tactical exercise that 
required participation by the recovery ships and aircraft for several weeks. The 
week beginning May 20 looked the most feasible for sending a second American 
into orbit.<A

light resulting from chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere. Various 
reactions produce light of different colors. In many cases, molecules of

comes, the gas molecules recombine, emitting light. The illumination of the sky 
at night usually comes from airglow instead of starlight. <I>New York Times</I>,
