<H1>Chapter 4</H1>
<H1>From NACA to NASA</H1>
<H2>(November 1957 - September 1958)</H2>[71] SPUTNIK II, carrying its canine 
passenger into orbit on November 3, 1957, made clear what the first Sputnik had 
only implied: the U.S.S.R. would eventually try to put a man in orbit. Americans 
read of this latest Soviet achievement and wondered how soon the West might be 
able to restore the technological and ideological balance. Throughout the United 
States, individuals and organizations were doing an uncommon amount of 
introspection. It was time for some rethinking and reexamination, for an inquiry 
into the nature, meaning, and direction of American government and society in 
the Space Age.
<P>One of the most introspective Government agencies in the post-Sputnik period 
was the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. To most people in NACA it 
was obvious that the organization had reached a crisis in its proud but rather 
obscure history; unless NACA moved rapidly and adroitly it might very well be 
overwhelmed in the national clamor for radical departures. New guidelines for 
its future clearly were in order. On November 18, 19, and 20, 1957, aboard the 
carrier <I>Forrestal</I> off the eastern coast of Florida, NACA's key Committee 
on Aerodynamics held another of its periodic meetings. Carried on in a mood of 
patriotic concern and challenge created by the Sputniks, these discussions 
reinforced the growing conviction that NACA should do more in astronautics. 
Among the 22 representatives of industry, the military, and academic aeronautics 
making up the committee, a consensus emerged that "NACA should act now to avoid 
being ruled out of the field of space flight research," and that "increased 
emphasis should be placed on research on the problems of true space flight over 
extended periods of time." The committee then adopted a resolution calling for 
"an aggressive program . . . for increased NACA participation in upper 
atmosphere and space flight research."<A

<P>Two days after the Committee on Aerodynamics adjourned, the Main Committee of 
NACA met and voted to establish a Special Committee on Space Technology. H. 
Guyford Stever, a physicist and dean of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, took charge of the heterogeneous group. The special committee was 
the first established by NACA to concern itself expressly and exclusively with 
space matters. It was "to survey the whole problem of space technology from the 
point of view of needed research and development and advise [76] the National 
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics with respect to actions which the NACA should 
take."<A

Appointed to the new committee were such diverse leaders in space science and 
technology as James A. Van Allen, Wernher von Braun, William H. Pickering, and 
W. Randolph Lovelace II.<A

<P>As apprehensive Americans watched the failure of the Vanguard test vehicle in 
December and the successful Jupiter-C launch of <I>Explorer I</I> in January, 
NACA continued to assess its potential role in the Space Age. Shortly after the 
Sputniks, NACA Director Hugh L. Dryden; Chairman James H. Doolittle; John F. 
Victory, the venerable executive secretary of NACA; and others at Headquarters 
in Washington had decided on the course NACA should follow in succeeding months. 
Assuming that now a unified space program would come into being, the NACA 
leaders wanted to ensure their organization a place in such a national 
enterprise. To Dryden, who largely guided the formulation of its strategy, NACA 
should proceed cautiously toward its minimum and yet most important objective - 
extension of its traditional preeminence as an aeronautical research 
organization into the higher realm of astronautics. This would involve a 
continuation of NACA's traditional function as planner, innovator, tester, and 
data-gatherer for the Defense Department and the missile and aircraft industry. 
While a larger role, entailing responsibilities for development, management, and 
flight operations in addition to research, very possibly could come to NACA in a 
national astronautics effort, publicly NACA should play down whatever ambitions 
for such a role individuals and groups within the agency might have.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-1.htm#source4"><SUP>4</A></SUP>
<P>In keeping with this "soft-sell" philosophy and plan of attack, the Main 
Committee, at its regular meeting of January 16, 1958, resolved that any 
national undertaking in astronautics should combine the talents and facilities 
of the Defense Department, NACA, the National Academy of Sciences, and the 
National Science Foundation. In other words, national space activities should 
follow roughly the pattern of Project Vanguard. NACA, while taking part in the 
launching of space vehicles and acquiring more authority to let research 
contracts, should continue to function primarily as a research institution.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-1.htm#source5"><SUP>5</A></SUP> 
Dryden essentially reiterated this viewpoint in a speech which Victory read for 
him nine days later before the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences in New 
York. The NACA Director proposed that the current division of labor among the 
military, industry, and NACA be perpetuated in a national space program, with 
NACA doing research and providing technical assistance and the military 
contracting with industry for hardware development.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-1.htm#source6"><SUP>6</A></SUP>
<P>Then, the next month, the Main Committee considered and circulated a 
prospectus inspired by Abe Silverstein, Associate Director of the Lewis 
Aeronautical Laboratory, and written mainly by his senior engineers. Entitled "A 
Program for Expansion of NACA Research in Space Flight Technology," it called 
for a "major expansion" of NACA activity to "provide basic research in support 
of the development of manned satellites and the travel of man to the moon and 
nearby planets." The Lewis group proposed an enlargement of NACA's existing 
laboratories and [77] a new, separate installation for nuclear powerplant 
research. The cost of the expansion of the program, including the expense of 
contracted research, was estimated at $200 million. Nothing was said about 
giving NACA added development, management, and operational tasks in manned space 
flight programs.<A

<P>So by early February 1958, as the Eisenhower administration began wrestling 
with the complexities of formulating a national program for space exploration, 
NACA had taken the official position that with regard to space it neither wanted 
nor expected more than its historic niche in Government-financed science and 
engineering. While NACA should become a substantially bigger instrument for 
research, it should remain essentially a producer of data for use by others.
