<H1>Training Primates and Men</H1>For the all-important task of checking out the 
environmental control system on a long-duration flight, a chimpanzee was chosen 
to "stand in" for man. As in the preparation for Ham's suborbital mission on 
MR-2, two colonies of chimps traveled to the Cape about three weeks before the 
flight date. Again the military handlers from Holloman Air Force Base separated 
the colonies to prevent cross-infection. Training involved restraining the 
animals in a pressurized flight couch, with biosensors attached to their bodies 
at various points. And psychomotor training that had been started in New Mexico 
was continued at the Cape so that the animals' proficiency would not 
deteriorate.<A

<P>On October 29, 1961, three chimps and 12 medical specialists moved into their 
Cape quarters to join two other simians and eight persons already in flight 
preparation status. The name given to "Enos," the animal selected as the flight 
test subject, in Greek or Hebrew means "man," and the training and flight 
performance recorded by this chimpanzee proved the sobriquet to be well chosen. 
Captain Jerry Fineg, chief veterinarian for the mission, described Enos as 
"quite a cool guy and not the performing type at all." This "immigrant" from the 
French Cameroons had none of the tendencies of his circus-trained counterparts. 
Enos' backup "pilots," listed in order of their flight readiness ability, were 
"Duane," named for Duane Mitch, a veterinarian; "Jim," named for Major James 
Cook, of the same profession; "Rocky," named for a well-known pugilist 
(Graziano) because of his cauliflowered ear and pugnacious spirit;and "Ham," the 
astrochimp veteran. The ratings were made by Fineg and another Air Force 
officer, Marvin Grunzke. Fineg later learned that when these same chimps had 
gone through their earlier launch and reentry training on the centrifuge at the 
University of Southern California, they had been rated in the same order.<A

<P>The psychomotor equipment used by Enos on the MA-5 mission was more 
complicated than that operated by Ham during the Mercury-Redstone 2 suborbital 
flight. Housed in the cover of his pressurized couch, Enos' package was rigged 
to present a four-problem cycle. The first would last for about 12 minutes, and 
the second followed six minutes of rest. The routine would proceed until the 
[401] cycle was completed, then the four problems would be repeated until the 
mission ended. Problem one would offer right- and left-hand levers that Enos 
could use to turn off lights, avoiding a mild shock in the left foot (the same 
as for Ham). The second problem planned was a delayed-response experiment. 
Twenty seconds after a green light would appear on the panel, Enos would have to 
press a lever to receive a drink of water. Although there would be no penalty 
for his failure to respond, if the chimpanzee should pull the lever too early 
the problem would simply recycle and he would receive nothing. The third, a 
fixed-ratio problem, would involve pulling a lever exactly 50 times to receive a 
banana pellet. This would also be voluntary and without penalty. Chimpanzee 
intelligence would be tested in the fourth. Three symbols - circles, triangles, 
and squares - would appear in various two-of-a-kind combinations, with the task 
being to pull a lever under the odd symbol to avoid a mild shock. Lack of 
response during rest periods would give the indication that the animal was well 
oriented to his spacecraft environment.<A

<P>Planning for this second trial of the Mercury worldwide tracking network was 
elaborate. Supporting the MA-5 mission were 18 stations, plus the Goddard Space 
Flight Center and the Mercury Control Center. Goddard and the Control Center 
furnished computer support and management of the overall operation, 
respectively.

undertaking of the Department of Defense, NASA, and industry.<A

<P>[402] Seventy-three key people assigned to the various stations received 
their final mission briefing on October 23. Once again the tracking teams 
included several Mercury astronauts. Shepard was assigned to Bermuda, Schirra to 
Australia, Slayton to Guaymas, and Cooper to Point Arguello, while at the Cape, 
Carpenter had a station in the blockhouse, Grissom was the capsule communicator 
in the Mercury Control Center, and Glenn served as backup capsule communicator 
in the center.<A

training tasks was to pull a lever exactly 50 times, and for his accuracy the 
animal received a reward of a banana pellet. More or less than 50 pulls caused 
the training unit to recycle without giving any reward. Stanley C. White of MSC 
medical operations told a reporter that the chimps would pull the lever 
"bangity-bangity-bang" about 45 times, then carefully pull Nos. 46, 47, 48, and 
49, and finally make pull No. 50 with one hand cupped under the dispenser to 
receive the reward. (Washington <I>Evening Star</I>, Nov. 28, 1961.) In a 
training test at Holloman a chimp working on a flashing-light problem pulled 
levers 7,000 times in 70 minutes, making only 28 errors. Kenneth F. Weaver,
