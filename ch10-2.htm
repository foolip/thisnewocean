<H1>Interregnum</H1>On January 16, 1961, President Eisenhower delivered his 
annual budget message to Congress, asking for amendments to the Space Act of 
1958 and referring to Project Mercury with far less confidence than he had shown 
five days earlier: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the program for manned space flight, the reliability of complex 
  booster, capsule, escape, and life-support components of the Mercury system is 
  now being tested to assure a safe manned ballistic flight into space, and 
  hopefully a manned orbital flight, in calendar year 1961. Further testing and 
  experimentation will be necessary to establish whether there are any valid 
  scientific reasons for extending manned spaceflight beyond the Mercury 
  program.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Members 
of the Space Task Group and of the Mercury team at large could take little 
comfort from the fact that this speaker was an outgoing President, for they also 
knew that the incoming President's scientific policy adviser had been quite 
critical of the "marginal" Mercury-Atlas program. Regarding "man-in-space," the 
Wiesner Committee had said: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>[305] We are rapidly approaching the time when the state of 
  technology will make it possible for man to go out into space. It is sure that 
  as soon as this possibility exists, man will be compelled to make use of it, 
  by the same motives that have compelled him to travel to the poles and to 
  climb the highest mountains of the earth. There are also dimly perceived 
  military and scientific missions in space which may prove to be very 
important.
  <P>By having placed highest national priority on the Mercury program, we have 
  strengthened the popular belief that man in space is the most important aim of 
  our non-military space effort. The manner in which this program has been 
  publicized in our press has further crystallized such belief. It exaggerates 
  the value of that aspect of space activity where we are less likely to achieve 
  success, and discounts those aspects in which we have already achieved great 
  success and will probably reap further successes in the future.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>When 
the managers of NASA and of STG, a few days later, became aware of the earlier, 
longer, confidential version of the Wiesner report, they were reminded of 
Mercury's tenuous standing as an urgent, but not an indispensable, "crash" 
program. If they should fail on their first attempt to place a man in space, or 
to put him in orbit, or to recover him from orbit, they not only would sacrifice 
a human life but create a national humiliation. Mercury managers had always been 
acutely aware of these portents, but the low status of Mercury in real and 
rumored policy papers made these days darker than ever. Wiesner's Committee 
recommended that Kennedy not allow "the present Mercury program to continue 
unchanged for more than a very few months," and that he not "effectively endorse 
this program and take the blame for its possible failures." Above all else the 
Wiesner Committee recommended that: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>We should stop advertising Mercury as our major objective in 
  space activities</I>. Indeed, we should make an effort to diminish the 
  significance of this program to its proper proportion before the public, both 
  at home and abroad. We should find effective means to make people appreciate 
  the cultural, public service, and military importance of space activities 
  other than space travel.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Next 
to Mercury, the Wiesner group was most critical of the Nation's booster program, 
particularly of the inability of United States rockets to lift heavy payloads 
into space. Measured by rocket thrust, Russian superiority continued 
unchallenged. Profound criticism was levelled at the Atlas, which was now truly 
operational as a weapon system, but which had failed signally in its five most 
recent tests as a launch vehicle for NASA payloads. Wiesner's committee 
recommended vigorous study of the Titan missile as an alternative Mercury 
launcher, but STG had already studied and rejected the Titan as a launch 
vehicle.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>Whereas there seemed to be threats of cancellation or modification of Project 
Mercury from all sides, the Mercury teammates knew from their MR-1A experience 
of December 19, 1960, that nothing succeeds like success. While some of them 
carefully but hurriedly made ready for MR-2, others just as desperately sought 
to ensure the success of MA-2.
<P>In moments of respite from its hectic pace, STG could see three essential 
tasks that had to be performed within a matter of weeks if the Task Group was to 
[306] be kept together and functioning. First was the necessity to send a 
chimpanzee on a successful Redstone flight. Second was the need to qualify the 
McDonnell capsule and all its systems by a Little Joe flight under max q 
conditions similar to the worst possible Atlas abort. Third, but perhaps most 
important, was the imperative need to test and prove as soon as possible the 
Mercury-Atlas combination, even if only on an elementary ballistic flight.<A

<P>The admittedly "hasty" Wiesner report was received by the press with mixed 
reactions. According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, the study was tacitly 
adopted by the President-elect when he named Wiesner, simultaneously with its 
release, Chairman of the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) for the 
new administration. <I>Aviation Week</I> said that Kennedy had rejected the 
committee's advice to revamp or scrap Mercury and that he had decided to risk 
receiving the blame if the first manned shot failed. To Roscoe Drummond, a 
syndicated columnist, the Wiesner report read like "a melange of observations 
based on superficial study." Drummond was highly critical of the entire 
political transition, noting that T. Keith Glennan had departed from Washington 
on Inauguration Day, January 20, 1961, leaving NASA headless, since no one had 
yet been named as his successor. Hugh L. Dryden, too, had resigned in accordance 
with protocol, but he remained on hand until he should be relieved. Drummond 
further charged that no Kennedy representative had consulted NASA to study the 
workings of the agency nor had any Kennedy official read or listened to 
briefings that had been prepared for the new leaders by outgoing Administrator 
Glennan and his staff.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
<P>In this time of transition NASA officials expected a stronger challenge to 
the civilian space agency's sphere of influence from the military, perhaps 
supported by some defense industry contractors. Part of the "military-industrial 
complex" against which Eisenhower had warned in his farewell address seemed to 
be lobbying to shrink NASA's function to that of the former NACA - applied 
research and development engineering.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> 
The retiring President also had warned against the domination of science by the 
needs of the Federal government and against the domination of public policy by a 
"scientific-technological elite." On the other hand, the editors of <I>Aviation 
Week</I> had expressed alarm several times over NASA's tendency toward 
enlargement of its own technical bureaucracy and assimilation of other space 
research organizations.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> 
Whether or not there was actually any "power struggle" among the Air Force, 
Army, and Navy over the spoils from a stripped NASA, any such fears of the 
Pentagon were premature while the Mercury-Redstone attempt to fly and recover an 
"astrochimp" was still pending.
<P>For some time, NASA had endured attacks from various eminent American men of 
science. The Wiesner report both reflected and encouraged such attitudes. 
Vannevar Bush, James R. Killian, and George B. Kistiakowsky were all long since 
on record as considering manned space flight a technological luxury that ought 
not to be allowed to eclipse more urgent scientific necessities. [307] Even 
within NASA, some scientists would have reallocated resources for manned space 
efforts beyond Mercury so as to give more funds and priority to instrumented, 
more purely scientific, research flights.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>Such political opinions of scientists to a large degree had been translated 
into official policy under the Eisenhower administration, whose last budget 
recommended a manned space flight research and development cut of $190.1 million 
from NASA's request for fiscal year 1962 of $1,109,600,000. The Bureau of the 
Budget in January allowed a total NASA request of $919.5 million, only $114 
million of which was earmarked for manned space flight, including Project 
Mercury. Some $584 million was requested for military astronautics within the 
total $41.2 billion request for the Defense Department's budget.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> 
Surely this contrast in funding carried significant meaning.
<P>The criticisms of NASA and its struggle for money in Washington were serious 
enough, but of far greater concern to the civil servants, contractors, and 
servicemen working with NASA and STG was the problem of "Mercury-rating" the 
Atlas. Since the unsolved MA-1 disaster at the end of July 1960 had been blamed 
on, but never isolated in, the interface area where the capsule and booster were 
mated, both the Air Force and NASA shared uneasily the responsibility for 
finding preventive medicine before MA-2 could be launched.
<P>The Wiesner Committee apparently had been unaware of the Rhode-Worthman 
Committee, established on December 19, 1960, four days after the explosion of 
the Atlas-Able 5-D Moon probe. NASA and the Air Force, acutely aware of 
Wiesner's activity, were pressuring the high-level investigating committee of 
seasoned engineers to find solutions to the interface problem. NASA Headquarters 
was very much concerned by the poor performance of the lighter-gauge Atlas 
modified for NASA launches and by the inability of STG and the Air Force complex 
to pinpoint the reason for the MA-1 failure. Richard V. Rhode, NASA 
Headquarters' senior structural engineer, was sent to California to press for a 
solution. The Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, under Major General O. J. 
Ritland and Brigadier General H. W. Powell, likewise had appointed a senior 
technical officer, Colonel Paul E. Worthman, to work with Rhode as co- chairman.
<P>During the last week of December 1960 and the first week of January 1961, the 
12 members of the Rhode-Worthman Committee met continuously at 
Convair/Astronautics in San Diego and at the Air Force Ballistic Missile 
Division in Los Angeles. One of the objectives of this meeting was to find a 
majority agreement on the diagnosis for MA-1 and the prognosis for MA-2. Paul E. 
Purser and Robert E. Vale, representing STG, with the aid of G. L. Armstrong of 
Convair, argued that a "quick-fix belly band" could be effectively used to 
reinforce the structural strength of the "thin-skinned" Atlas. Specifically they 
had in mind Atlas No. 67-D, which had been at the Cape since September, being 
prepared for mating with capsule No. 6 for the MA-2 launch. On the other hand, 
Bernhard A. Hohmann of Aerospace urged strengthening the adapter ring. James A. 
Chamberlin forthwith had redesigned the fillets and stringers in that casing 
also. [308] Because a "thick-skinned" Atlas - one whose upper conical sections 
would be made of stainless steel approximately .02 instead of .01 inch in 
thickness, costing thereby an extra 100 pounds in weight - could not be finished 
and shipped to the Cape before late March 1961, the Rhode-Worthman Committee 
finally, but not unanimously, agreed not to wait for a replacement booster. NASA 
assumed the risk of a messy technical and political situation in the event of 
failure, and the Air Force agreed to make every effort to push MA-2 through the 
region of maximum aerodynamic and political stress as soon as possible. But 
precisely how to do this still remained debatable.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>New band stiffeners in the adapter ring, some 20 extra accelerometers, strain 
gauges, pressure sensors, and mandatory operational restrictions for mild 
weather, winds, and complete photographic coverage, plus the use of the 
improvised truss or corset, called the "belly band," for MA- 2, were all 
included in the interim report of the Rhode-Worthman Committee, issued on 
January 19, 1961. The joint team effort required for these decisions, said 
Purser to Rhode, "admittedly has not always been easy, but we believe it has 
worked. 'Resolution of conflicts of technical judgment' has been achieved by 
mutual discussion and education rather than by manager edicts."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> 
The reluctance of Aerospace and STL representatives to accept the "belly band" 
truss was symbolized at first by their use of the invidious metaphor "horse 
collar" to describe it. So apt and fitting was the "horse collar" in 
distributing the load of max q over the Atlas airframe that all parties accepted 
the nickname and the hardware by mid-February. Meanwhile work proceeded 
frantically in laboratories and wind tunnels at Ames and at Tullahoma, 
Tennessee, to provide all the information possible through simulated conditions 
before subjecting this "quick-fix" to a flight test. But there was great drama 
and suspense in the technological preparations for the vitally important 
launching known as Mercury-Atlas 2.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>Now that Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson, an early advocate of a strong 
space program and slated to become the new chairman of the strengthened Space 
Council, promised energetic leadership among the countervailing powers in 
Washington, the aerospace community waited impatiently to hear who would be 
named the new NASA Administrator. Kennedy assigned Johnson this task of 
selection. Considering Johnson's long-standing interest in space matters, many 
observers had supposed that the selection would be made soon after the election 
and that the designee might be a member of the Wiesner Committee.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> 
But the case was not so simple. The problem seemed to be one of settling on 
qualifications and then finding a man who would agree to preside over an agency 
with an uncertain future. The risk of becoming a political scapegoat was great 
indeed. The Wiesner report stipulated that one of the prerequisites for a member 
of the Space Council was that he be technically well-informed, and this 
requirement would apply also to the NASA Administrator. But whereas a university 
scientist with engineering and executive experience might meet this 
qualification, Washington and management experience also was essential.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>[309] Kennedy remarked at a press conference, five days after his 
inauguration, that the NASA Administrator should be chosen by the end of the 
week, thereby deflecting newsmen's attention to the Vice-President for the name 
of the new Administrator. Johnson, in turn, received suggestions from his former 
Congressional colleagues on the space committees, and Wiesner called to 
Washington the man who accepted the post. On February 2, 1961, Senator Robert S. 
Kerr, Democrat from Oklahoma and Johnson‘s successor as chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, presided at the confirmation 
hearings on the nomination of James Edwin Webb.
<P>An experienced business head of numerous corporations, a lawyer, Director of 
the Bureau of the Budget from 1946 to 1949, and Under Secretary of the 
Department of State from 1949 to 1951, James E. Webb also had been a director of 
the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and a reserve officer and pilot in the Marine 
Corps. Although his background was not that of a scientist, he was widely known 
in governmental and industrial circles for having worked with scientists on 
committees and with engineers as a director of such organizations as Educational 
Services, Incorporated; the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies; Sperry 
Gyroscope Company; and as a trustee of George Washington University.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> 
Webb's appointment as NASA Administrator came as a surprise to those who 
expected one of the Wiesner Committee to be chosen. A few critics said that he 
lacked the technical background necessary to attract scientists and eminent 
engineers to NASA and that his nomination was a result of Senator Kerr's 
influence. But Wiesner supported and the Senate confirmed Webb's nomination 
after Webb severed all his business connections with McDonnell Aircraft. His 
active interest in science suggested that Webb would strive to keep a balance 
between science and technology in space activities. His governmental and 
executive experience promised that he could work well with the Bureau of the 
Budget and with the aerospace industries to promote NASA's interests. Webb's 
intellectual interests in public administration and international affairs 
indicated that he might become instrumental in achieving international 
agreements to prevent space from becoming a new theater for conflict in the cold 
war. Indeed, Webb's supporters felt certain that he actively would invite the 
Soviets to cooperate in American space exploration projects, a proposal that 
Kennedy had made notable in his inaugural address.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-2.htm#source21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>With a vigorous new Administrator as its spokesman, and with the 
reconfirmation of Dryden as second in command, NASA quickly regained confidence 
regarding the scientific, budgetary, and military-industrial obstacles to its 
manned space flight program. In facing the military, Webb had the support of 
Representative Overton Brooks, chairman of the House Committee on Science and 
Astronautics. Early in 1961, Brooks became the first highly placed government 
official to lambaste the presumed campaign to build, at the expense of NASA, a 
stronger military space program.<A

Robert R. Gilruth was asked about the possibility of using the Titan rather than 
the Atlas for orbital flight. Gilruth said he preferred the Atlas, pointing out 
that the technical problems connected with it were being solved, whereas those 
associated with the Titan were nowhere near solution. The fact that the second 
stage of the two-stage Titan ignited in flight presented additional problems to 
orbital flight, he said. In contrast all three Atlas engines ignited at liftoff. 
Gilruth actually drafted a letter intended for Maj. Gen. Osmond J. Ritland, 
commander of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, asking for a briefing on 
the possible application of the Titan to the Mercury program. The letter 
(Gilruth to Ritland, Jan. 18, 1961) was never mailed, primarily because the 
conceptual development of the follow-on program after Mercury was beginning to 
take shape. In May 1961 Robert C. Seamans was sold on the Titan II as a launch 
vehicle for Mercury Mark II, and thereafter NASA and DOD agreed to support each 
other's use of Titan II and III respectively; Seamans, interview, Washington,

being undercut and thereby weakening the structural strength even more. General 
Dynamics responded that they had a technician with capability to prevent 
undercutting. Rhode asked to be shown. After seeing the proof, he directed that
