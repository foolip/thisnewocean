<H1>Costs and Cancellations</H1>Trying to estimate what it should cost to 
develop hardware from their designs for a manned satellite, STG at first 
envisioned an expenditure of about $16 million to manufacture the program's 
spacecraft. But well before the contractor had been selected, Gilruth received a 
revised estimate based on new specifications, allowances for overtime, the fixed 
fee plus the estimated construction costs, and comparing capsule cost per pound 
with that of the X-15 and Dyna-Soar programs. George F. MacDougall, Jr., the 
aeronautical research scientist who signed this revised estimate, advised that 
the capsule costs should be raised to $22 million. Neither an economist nor a 
cost accountant, he did foresee the possibility "that the current estimated 
costs of $22,000,000 may be optimistically low."<A

<P>The contract negotiated with McDonnell had compromised between the company's 
bid of $17,583,717, which was far from the lowest, and the more liberal STG 
estimate, to settle on a price of $18,300,000 for manufacturing 12 capsules. In 
view of this compromise upward, NASA officials were unprepared for the sudden 
acceleration of costs that the contractor claimed was necessary for spare parts, 
ground support, and checkout equipment. Before the ink was dry on the prime 
contract, the scope of research and development work was found to have 
mushroomed. In March, when McDonnell advised NASA that spares and test equipment 
would more than double the total contract costs, Abe Silverstein applied 
counterpressure, saying indignantly, "I will not tolerate increases such as 
those above in the contract for any reasons - utterly unreasonable to increase 
an $18,000,000 contract to $41,000,000 by these devices."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile STG and McDonnell representatives held a meeting at the working 
level to consolidate and condense the requirements for spare parts and 
equipment. Savings effected here were eventually greatly overridden by costs 
arising elsewhere. No one could yet foresee that the basic contract for 12 
spacecraft would have an evolutionary history of its own.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source47"><SUP>47</SUP></A> 
Cost accounting for a development program was recognized as a hazardous 
occupation, but just how hazardous and where to look for particular pitfalls 
took time to learn.
<P>Whereas cynics might expect that the private-enterprise contractor for the 
capsule might have underbid to gain the contract, the civil servants in STG were 
[151] more surprised to learn that the public enterprise of furnishing the 
Nation's ballistic missile defense systems should also have underestimated costs 
by approximately one third. Informed by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division 
in January that each Atlas booster would cost $3.3 million instead of $2.5 
million, George Low tried for two months to get a satisfactory explanation of 
this sudden inflation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>When in May, however, the STG learned of an increase by $8 million in the 
amount the Army Ballistic Missile Agency proposed to charge for the Redstones 
and Jupiters, the time had come for a thoroughgoing review of cost effectiveness 
and program requirements. Gilruth and Purser learned by investigation that the 
Ballistic Missile Agency was billing NASA a "burden" surcharge for the benefit 
of laboratory overhead costs at Huntsville. Purser's considered reaction to this 
was to threaten cancellation of the Jupiter program. If NASA must pay for 
research and development at the Redstone Arsenal, he said, then NASA, and STG in 
particular, must be more frugal in the estimation of their needs.
<P>The Jupiter rocket had been selected to boost a full-scale capsule to about 
16,000 feet per second, a velocity midway between the capacities of Little Joe 
and Redstone (6000 feet per second), and of Atlas (25,000 feet per second). But 
rather than insist on this step, Purser argued that the Atlas should be 
harnessed to duplicate the mission of the Jupiter flights. Since "the cost now 
equals or exceeds the cost of an Atlas for the same mission" and the Jupiter 
system would not be a "true duplicate of the Mercury capsule system," Purser 
recommended that the two Jupiter shots be canceled.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>
<P>After further consideration and more negotiations, Purser's recommendation 
was adopted by NASA Headquarters; the Jupiter series was eliminated from the 
Mercury program. In the aftermath of this episode, Glennan made an official 
complaint to the Secretary of Defense about the necessity to curtail proposed 
launchings to control costs, describing the situation with some chagrin: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Members of the staff who have visited Redstone Arsenal report that 
  exceptionally high overhead rates apparently result from the necessity of 
  supporting a large technical staff with a limited approved work program. The 
  net result to us has been the increased costs of a Jupiter launching to more 
  than that of an Atlas, whereas a Redstone launching is about $200,000 less 
  than that of an Atlas. The prices being 2.7 and 2.9 million respectively.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source50"><SUP>50</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>At 
the same time Mercury engineers who were looking for an alternative to the 
balloon flight program discovered that the altitude wind tunnel, the biggest 
physical installation at Lewis Research Center, could be used to simulate 
environmental conditions up to 80,000 feet. Therefore the balloon flight test 
program, primarily designed to "soak" the capsule at comparable altitudes, was 
in effect canceled by May. DeMarquis D. Wyatt and other NASA Headquarters 
staffers preparing the budget requests for fiscal year 1960 now had evidence of 
STG's cost consciousness. The cancellations of the Jupiter series and the 
balloon program greatly simplified the program buildup toward manned space 
flight. STG engineers were pleased by the resulting concentration of effort.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>[152] One reason STG shed no tears over cancellation of Jupiter and the 
balloon tests was that the Little Joe program was making good progress. 
Blueprint work for the Little Joe airframe had begun early in 1959. North 
American had assigned A. L. Lawbaugh as project engineer; Langley Research 
Center had appointed Carl A. Sandahl as its representative for support of this 
test booster program; and William M. Bland, Jr., was managing Little Joe for the 
Space Task Group. Throughout the year 1959 these three men were primarily 
responsible for Little Joe.
<P>Two significant design changes for Little Joe early in 1959 undoubtedly 
delayed the program slightly but contributed greatly to its eventual success. 
The first change, decided upon by Gilruth and Faget in January, required a 
switch from straight to canted nozzles on all the forward-thrusting rocket 
motors. Little Joe had no guidance system, and such a redesign would minimize 
any upset from unsymmetrical thrust conditions. The other departure from the 
original design was the addition of a so-called "booster destruct system." In 
the interest of range safety there should be some provision to terminate by 
command the thrust of the main motor units. Therefore Charles H. McFall and 
Samuel Sokol of Langley devised a booster blowout system, which North American 
and Thiokol Chemical Corporation, the manufacturers of the rocket motor 
components, added to the forward end of each rocket combustion chamber.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>By mid-February it was apparent that a development program for rocket 
hardware, even of such limited scope and relative simplicity as the Little Joe 
booster, demanded a far more sophisticated management organization than either 
Langley or the Task Group had envisioned. Although informal arrangements had 
sufficed to get the program started, funding allocations, personnel expansion, 
and contract monitoring problems began to weigh heavily. Carl Sandahl lamented 
in one weekly progress report that the transfer of Caldwell C. Johnson from 
Langley to the Space Task Group could "just about break up the Little Joe 
Project." Langley's loss was STG's gain in this respect, however, and 
cooperation continued to be encouraging. Indeed, in May, Bland reported that the 
delivery of the first Little Joe booster airframe could be expected 
approximately two weeks earlier than scheduled.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>Parallel to the development of the Little Joe test booster, STG and Langley 
engineers continued work on what now was called the Scout, the multistage, 
solid-propellant research rocket being designed since the previous year for 
sounding, probe, or small satellite missions. Langley had maintained its 
responsibility for designing the Scout for the Air Force after NACA became NASA; 
and early in 1959, Robert O. Piland and Joseph G. Thibodeaux came to work with 
William E. Stoney on the staging principles for the long, slim rocket. Although 
the Scout, as a Langley project, was not an integral part of STG's activities in 
Project Mercury, the Task Group held open the possibility of using this simple 
and relatively inexpensive rocket to launch scale models of the Mercury 
configuration and to probe for further critical data on heat transfer and 
stability. Thus the [153] Scout's capability could fill research gaps that might 
arise in the manned satellite project.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
<P>Since January, when it had become apparent that the Army would not soon 
relinquish to NASA its rocket development team at Huntsville, NASA Headquarters 
had encouraged the Space Task Group to proceed full speed on personnel 
recruitment. The exact status of the organization and authority of STG was left 
unspecified, while Headquarters felt its way toward the establishment of the 
"space projects center" at Beltsville, just outside Washington. Although NASA 
had a "hunting license" as a result of its enabling legislation, STG's managers 
could not, without full support from President Eisenhower or Administrator 
Glennan, know how far or how hard to push the Space Task Group toward a 
permanent semi-autonomous establishment.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
<P>STG's need for acquiring competent people without raiding established NASA 
research centers was met in large degree by a fortuitous accident that 
dramatized Anglo-European complaints about the "brain drain" of their 
scientific-technological manpower to the United States. A group of over 100 
Canadian and British aeronautical engineers, who had been employed on a 
fighter-plane project for the British A. V. Roe (AVRO) Company near Toronto, 
Canada, were out of work. AVRO tried to find new jobs for them when the CF-105 
Arrow project was canceled as a result of the Commonwealth's decision that the 
Bomarc missile made the Arrow obsolescent. Twenty-five of these engineers, led 
by James A. Chamberlin, a Canadian, were recruited by STG and immigrated to work 
at NASA's Virginia colony in mid-April. They were assigned jobs as individuals 
with the existing teams wherever each could be most useful, and they quickly 
proved themselves invaluable additions to making Mercury move.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
<P>At the same time, the chief business administrator of the new NASA center at 
Beltsville, Michael J. Vaccaro, was planning to accommodate a complement of 425 
people for fiscal year 1960 should Gilruth and his manned satellite team move to 
Maryland. On the first day of May 1959 the "space projects center," growing out 
of Naval Research Laboratory's Vanguard team, was renamed the Goddard Space 
Flight Center, and Gilruth's second hat, as the Center's Assistant Director for 
Manned Satellites, was reaffirmed. The Mercury program was specified as one of 
the six divisional offices at Goddard.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
<P>While many questions of personnel, network management, and contract 
procedures for the capsule were still pending, Glennan made his first visit to 
the Space Task Group at Langley on May 18, 1959. He was impressed by the 
enormity of Project Mercury, by its working-level complexities, and by the 
extraordinarily fine morale in STG. Glennan returned to Washington resolved not 
to tamper with the esprit of STG. But he was also determined that NASA as a 
whole should not become a "space cadet" organization.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-6.htm#source58"><SUP>58</SUP></A> 
The Administrator's resolution that NASA must not be overwhelmed by the 
complexities of manned space flight led to a Headquarters policy of minimal 
interference with the Task Group. During the next year, however, the weight of 
pressure from [154] the public press and the scope of intragovernmental 
coordination related to Mercury was to strain this policy.
