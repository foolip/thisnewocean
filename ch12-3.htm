<H1>Space Task Group Gets a New Home and Name</H1>Between flight planning and 
scheduling launches in August 1961, a NASA site survey team headed by John F. 
Parsons, Associate Director of Ames Research Center, had inspected a number of 
sites competing for the permanent location of a center for manned space flight 
projects. The new center had been approved in principle by President Kennedy in 
accordance with his strategic decision, endorsed by the Congress, to accelerate 
the space program. The team appraised the sites on 10 points, briefly stated as 
follows: availability of educational institutions and other facilities for 
advanced scientific study, electric power and other utilities, water supply, 
climate, housing, acreage, proximity to varied industrial enterprises, water 
transportation, air transportation, and local cultural and recreational 
resources. On September 19, 1961, NASA Administrator James E. Webb announced 
that the new Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) would be established on a 1,000-acre 
tract to be transferred to the Government by Rice University, near Houston. The 
site was in Harris County, Texas, on the edge of Clear Lake, an inlet of 
Galveston Bay on the Gulf of Mexico.<A

<P>Webb maintained that selection of the Houston site had been influenced by 
[391] recent decisions to expand the launch complex at the Atlantic Missile 
Range and to establish a fabrication facility for large booster and space 
vehicle stages at the Michoud Plant, near New Orleans, where torpedo boats had 
been manufactured during World War II. The Manned Spacecraft Center, the Michoud 
Operations, and the Cape Canaveral complex would become a vast integrated 
enterprise coordinating the development, manufacture, and operation of the 
manned space flight program.
<P>Not unexpectedly, there was some criticism of the Texas site chosen for the 
new development center. Charges of inordinate political influence involved the 
names of Vice-President Johnson, a Texan and chairman of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Council, and Democratic Representative Albert Thomas of 
Houston, Chairman of the House of Representatives Independent Offices 
Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. NASA spokesmen categorically 
denied that there had been any improper influence. Particularly crestfallen were 
the citizens of the Virginia peninsula, who realized they were losing some of 
the activities at the Langley Research Center and the Wallops Station. All 
through August, September, and October, the dailies of Newport News echoed this 
disappointment. To Houston, of course, this was "wonderful news," as the Chamber 
of Commerce proclaimed, and local business leaders dispatched representatives to 
brief the transferring NASA employees in Virginia on the advantages of the Texas 
coast.<A

<P>Less than a month after Webb's announcement, a Houston journalist went on an 
inspection tour of the site planned for the spacecraft center. He found cowboys 
driving herds of cattle to new pasture, a crew of surveyors from the Army Corps 
of Engineers mapping the prairie near Clear Lake and fighting snakes, and a lone 
wolf hunter with the carcass of a freshly slain wolf. The hunter said he had 
just seen several wild turkeys, a fox, and many deer tracks.<A

<P>[392] Gilruth and other officials of the Space Task Group reacted quickly to 
the Webb announcement. The very next day they flew into Houston to begin a 
search for an estimated 100,000 square feet of temporary floor space. Moving 
began in October 1961, when Martin A. Byrnes, as the local manager, and a small 
cadre of center operations, procurement, and personnel employees opened offices 
in Houston's Gulfgate Shopping City. By mid-1962, when the move was completed, 
activities were scattered in 11 locations, occupying 295,996 square feet of 
leased office and laboratory space in the vicinity of Telephone Road and the 
Gulf Freeway. For both old and new employees, a street map was a necessity in 
the coordination of information among the various offices located in the 
dispersed buildings. Besides the leased quarters, NASA personnel liberally used 
surplus facilities available at nearby Ellington Air Force Base.<A

<P>By early October 1961, the Space Task Group had established an information 
relocation center in its Public Affairs Office to help personnel facing the 
move. Inquiries from the employees about schools and housing were numerous. 
Shortly thereafter, members of the Space Task Group received procedure 
directions for permanent change of duty station and then were advised on 
November 1, 1961, that "the Space Task Group is officially redesignated the 
Manned Spacecraft Center." The center was now a de facto NASA unit, a nerve 
center of the accelerated manned space flight program. It was several months, 
however, before the administration of projects was subdivided for management of 
the three major programs - Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. NASA outlined its 
building requirements for the center on October 13, 1961, at which time two 
plans were under consideration, one with 13 major buildings and the other with 
14, to accommodate 3,151 people. The estimated cost was $60 million for the 
first year's construction.<A
