<H1>Second Suborbital Trial</H1>Preparation for the second suborbital flight of 
man into space was essentially the same as that for Shepard and <I>Freedom 
7</I>. Much of the astronaut and ground support training, spacecraft checkout, 
and booster preparation had been accomplished concurrently with the grooming of 
MR-3, since the anticipated six-week interval was too short to begin anew. Thus 
Air Force Captain Virgil I. Grissom, told by Gilruth in January 1961 that he 
would probably be the pilot for Mercury-Redstone 4, and John H. Glenn, Jr., once 
again the suborbital backup pilot, returned to work quickly after Shepard's 
flight. In April all three had undergone refresher centrifuge training at 
Johnsville, and now they were well fortified to endure the actual Redstone 
acceleration profile.
<P>Most of their training period was spent at the Cape so that Grissom and Glenn 
could follow the technical progress of spacecraft and launch vehicle by 
participating in minute checkout operations. In Hangar S the astronauts 
exercised themselves and all their capsule systems in the simulated 
high-altitude chamber tests. Their physicians recorded metabolic data and 
refined physiological reactions. Communication checks, manual control system 
checks, sequence system verifications, and many simulated missions in the 
procedures trainer kept them busy. Twice Grissom and Glenn went back to Langley 
for sessions in the ALFA trainer. In all, each simulated about 100 
Mercury-Redstone flights before the upcoming MR-4 launch, scheduled for July.<A

<P>Spacecraft No. 11, designated since October for the second manned Mercury 
flight, had come off the production line at McDonnell in May 1960. As the first 
operational capsule with a centerline window, No. 11 more nearly approximated 
the orbital version of the Mercury capsule than Shepard's <I>Freedom 7</I>, or 
spacecraft No. 7.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source42"><SUP>42</A></SUP>
<P>Among other innovations in No. 11 for MR-4 was an explosive side hatch, whose 
evolution, encouraged by the astronaut corps, had begun early in the Mercury 
program. The original egress procedure had been to climb out through the antenna 
compartment,a difficult maneuver that required the removal of a small pressure 
bulkhead. Since all the astronauts had found it hard to snake out the top of the 
frustum and cylinder, the STG and McDonnell designers had concluded that removal 
of an injured astronaut would be even more precarious. Moreover, valuable time 
would be lost in such a rescue [367] operation; to open the hatch from the 
outside, someone had to remove several shingles and 70 bolts.
<P>McDonnell engineers set to work on the problem and came up with two egress 
hatch models - one with a latch, which was used on Ham's MR-2 and Shepard's MR-3 
missions, the other with an explosive hatch cover. The simple latch mechanism 
weighed 69 pounds, too much of a weight addition for incorporation in the 
orbital version of the spacecraft. The explosive hatch, on the other hand, 
utilized the 70 bolts of the original design; a .06-inch hole was bored into 
each of the quarter-inch titanium bolts to provide a weak point. When a mild 
detonating fuse, placed in a groove around each bolt, was energized, the bolts 
were sheared simultaneously and the hatch sprang open.
<P>There were two ways to activate the explosive egress hatch during recovery. 
About six to eight inches from the astronaut's right arm, as he lay in his 
couch, was a knobbed plunger. The pilot would remove a pin and press the plunger 
with a fist-force of five or six pounds, detonating the small explosive charge 
and blasting the hatch 25 feet away in a second. If the pin was in place, a 
fist-force of 40 pounds was required. A rescuer outside the capsule could blow 
open the hatch simply by removing a small panel from the fuselage side and 
pulling a lanyard. This complete explosive hatch weighed only 23 pounds.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source43"><SUP>43</A></SUP>
<P>The welcome new trapezoidal window assembly on spacecraft No. 11 replaced the 
two 10-inch side ports through which Shepard strained to see. The pilot now 
could look upward slightly and see directly outside. Visually the field covered 
30 degrees in the horizontal plane and 33 degrees in the vertical. The Corning 
Glass Works of Corning, New York, designed and developed the multilayered panes. 
The outer pane was made of Vycor glass, .35-inch thick, and could withstand 
temperatures on the order of 1500 to 1800 degrees F. Three panels were bonded to 
make the inner pane, one a .17-inch- thick sheet of Vycor, the two others made 
of tempered glass. This fenestration was as strong as any part of the capsule 
pressure vessel.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source44"><SUP>44</A></SUP>
<P>The manual controls for the second manned flight incorporated the new rate 
stabilization control system. With it the astronaut could control the rate of 
spacecraft attitude movements by small turns of his hand controller rather than 
by jockeying the device to attain the desired position. This rate damping or 
rate augmentation system, like power steering on an automobile, gave finer and 
easier handling qualities and another redundant means of driving the pitch, yaw, 
and roll thrusters.
<P>By the time of the MR-4 flight, Lewis Research Center and Space Task Group 
engineers had analyzed the thrust rating of the posigrade rockets and had made a 
valuable discovery. Fired into the booster-spacecraft adapter, the posigrade 
rockets developed 78 percent greater thrust than when fired openly. Accordingly 
the capsule separation rockets when ignited inside the adapter,producing what 
the NASA testers called a "popgun effect," afforded an initial [368] separation 
velocity of about 28.1 feet per second. This determination provided the 
engineers with the confidence that spacecraft-booster separation would occur 
with little likelihood of recontact.
<P>STG's calculations indicated that the Redstone booster and the Mercury 
spacecraft should be about 4,000 feet apart on their suborbital trajectory at 
retrofire. The unbraked booster would hit the water some 566.2 seconds after 
launch, while the longer and steeper trajectory of the spacecraft would keep it 
aloft 911.1 seconds. The booster would land about 16 1/2 miles beyond the 
spacecraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source45"><SUP>45</A></SUP> 
Because of the relatively short distance between the two impact points, STG was 
concerned enough to assign John P. Mayer and Ted H. Skopinski to study the 
problem, especially as related to possible recontact of the spacecraft and the 
booster after separation. As a result of the studies, Skopinski's 
recommendations for minor changes in the sequencing of retrofire were accepted 
as solutions to prevent recontact.
<P>Other hardware changes involved attaching a redesigned fairing for the 
capsule adapter clamp-ring, rearranging the capsule instrument panel, and adding 
more foam padding to the head area of the contour couch. The fairing and some 
more insulation should overcome the vibration and consequent blurred vision 
Shepard had complained about, while the rearrangement of the instruments sought 
to improve the eye-scan pattern, which Shepard had found poor. These changes 
cost several more weeks' time. On July 15, 1961, Gilruth affirmed that Grissom 
would be the prime pilot for Mercury-Redstone No. 4 and that Glenn would be his 
stand-in. Grissom in turn announced that he had chosen the name <I>Liberty Bell 
7</I> as the most appropriate call-sign for his bell-shaped capsule, because the 
name was to Americans almost synonymous with "freedom" and symbolic numerically 
of the continuous teamwork it represented.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source46"><SUP>46</A></SUP>
<P>Modifications made on Grissom's pressure suit reflected the experiences of 
Shepard's flight. Nylon-sealed ball-bearing rings were fitted at the glove 
connections to allow full rotation of the wrists while the suit was pressurized. 
A new personal parachute harness was designed to keep the chute out of the way. 
On the chest of Grissom's suit was a convex mirror, called a "hero's medal" by 
the astronaut corps, that served simply to allow the pilot-observer camera to 
photograph instrument readings. Another welcome addition to the suit was a urine 
reservoir, fabricated the day before the flight. Although during his flight 
Grissom would find the contraption somewhat binding, it did work. Lastly, 
Grissom's helmet was equipped with new microphones that promised to filter out 
more noise and make transmission quality even better.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source47"><SUP>47</A></SUP>
<P>Materials successfully used in other phases of the space program also became 
a part of the second manned flight. In the continuing quest for weight 
reduction, a lightweight, radar-reflective life raft was developed jointly by 
the Langley Research Center and the Space Task Group. Weighing three pounds and 
four ounces (45 percent lighter than the original version), this raft was 
constructed [369] of Mylar and nylon, the same materials used in <I>Echo I</I>, 
the passive communication satellite balloon that began circling the globe in 
August 1960. The survival pack, with the raft inside, was secured on a shelf in 
the spacecraft conveniently near the astronaut's left arm.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source48"><SUP>48</A></SUP>
<P>Grissom's flight plan was revised rapidly and altered substantially as a 
result of MR-3. Shepard had really been overloaded with activities during his 
five minutes of weightlessness. Now Grissom was given a chance to look through 
his new trapezoidal window to learn more about man's visual abilities in space. 
If he could recognize landmarks for flight reference, the pilot tasks for the 
Mercury orbital flights might be considerably simplified. Shepard had assumed 
manual control of only one axis of movement - yaw, pitch, or roll - at a time, 
whereas Grissom had instructions to assume complete manual control as soon as he 
could, to make three maneuvers in about one minute instead of Shepard's 12 
minutes, and then to spend as much time as possible making exterior 
observations.
<P>Mercury-Redstone booster No. 8 had arrived at Cape Canaveral on June 8. Kurt 
H. Debus' contingent of Wernher von Braun's team and G. Merritt Preston's 
capsule checkout team had proceeded with the mating of the launch vehicle and 
capsule and the checkout requirements. On July 13, the flight safety review was 
held and the spacecraft was pronounced ready for flight. Two days later Walter 
Williams heard the reports during the mission review; the Redstone and 
<I>Liberty Bell 7</I> were pronounced ready to go. The recovery ships, 
anticipating the launch date on Tuesday, July 18, moved into their assigned 
positions.
<P>Essentially a repeat of MR-3, Grissom's flight was to reach an apogee of 116 
miles, over a range of 299 miles, with the astronaut feeling a maximum 
acceleration load of 6.33 g and deceleration of 10.96 g. Only the launching 
azimuth, changed by three degrees to stay within range bounds, varied from 
Shepard's flight into space.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source49"><SUP>49</A></SUP>
<P>On July 16 the news media received a weather bulletin predicting that the 
cloud cover in the launch area for the next 48 hours would be below average, but 
that the impact area would be slightly cloudier than usual. The mission was 
postponed early Tuesday, the 18th, in hope of better weather. Fortunately the 
frosty liquid oxygen had not been loaded so the launch delay was only 24, rather 
than 48, hours.
<P>Early Wednesday, July 19, Grissom, asleep in his quarters on the balcony of 
Hangar S, was awakened by his physician, William Douglas, who told him that 
Walter Williams' operations team was pushing for a 7 a.m. launch to beat the 
weather. The launch day routine began again. By 5 a.m. Grissom was up in the 
gantry. He slid into his niche; the count resumed and continued unbroken until 
10 minutes and 30 seconds before launch, when a hold was called to wait for a 
rift in the cloud cover. When no break appeared, the mission was scrubbed again. 
This time the liquid oxygen had been tanked, so a dreary 48-hour delay would be 
necessary.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source50"><SUP>50</A></SUP>
<P>The weather conditions on July 21 were still not ideal. The view from an 
[370] altitude of a hundred miles would show that all the northern portion of 
Florida was completely obscured by high cirrus and lower patches of cumulus 
clouds. Southern Florida and Cuba would be splotched by scattered cumulus. The 
operations team nevertheless decided that since the view was not essential to 
the success of the mission, the launch should come off as scheduled.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source51"><SUP>51</A></SUP>
<P>Because Grissom had shaved and showered before going to bed rather than 
before his low-residue breakfast, and because Slayton, the blockhouse 
communicator, briefed the astronaut on the status of the capsule and booster 
during the van ride to the pad rather than just before gantry ascent, the 
routine was a bit less hurried. George E. Ruff, an Air Force psychiatrist, had 
time to interrogate Grissom about his feelings before he lay in his contour 
couch for MR-4's liftoff.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source52"><SUP>52</A></SUP>
<P>Grissom was unruffled, calm, and poised as he entered <I>Liberty Bell 7</I> 
again. The count resumed and proceeded smoothly until 45 minutes before launch 
time, when a gantry technician discovered that one of the 70 hatch bolts was 
misaligned. A 30-minute hold was called, during which the McDonnell and STG 
supervisory engineers decided that the remaining 69 bolts were sufficient to 
hold and blow the hatch, so the misaligned bolt was not replaced. The countdown 
was resumed, but two more holds for minor reasons cost another hour's wait.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-7.htm#source53"><SUP>53</A></SUP>
<P>Alone in his capsule awaiting liftoff, Grissom experienced a wide range of 
impressions. As the gantry, or service structure, moved back from the launch 
vehicle, he had the illusion that he was falling. His pulse rate ranged from 64 
to 162 beats per minute, depending upon his feelings. His heart beat rose during 
the oxygen purge, fell while the hatch bolt repair decision was being made, rose 
again when the go decision was made, and finally doubled at launch. His liftoff 
was at 7:20a.m.<A

the original Liberty Bell on spacecraft No. 11. Other astronaut assignments for 
the MR-4 mission put Shepard and Schirra in the Mercury Control Center, the 
former as "Cap Com," the latter as observer; Slayton and Carpenter in the

day of the flight, the suit inlet temperature (55 degrees F) was more

which in the past had caused telemetry interference.
<P>Next came a 41-minute hold because cloudy skies had reduced light conditions 
to below par for camera coverage. During this hold, the main inverter began to 
overheat, reaching 190 degrees F, and so Grissom switched to the standby unit to 
allow the main component to cool. When the count resumed at 15 minutes before 
launch, he switched back to the main inverter. Significantly, during the 80 
extra minutes from astronaut insertion to liftoff, not one of the holds was 
chargeable to the booster. Sjoberg undated memo; "Postlaunch Memorandum Report

<P>In an interview with Grissom on April 12, 1965, the pilot stated that the 
misaligned bolt had nothing to do with the premature explosion of the hatch. In 
fact, if a number of bolts were misaligned it would be unlikely that the hatch 
would blow off at all. Grissom now has the misaligned bolt as a souvenir.
