<H1>Vostok Wins the First Lap</H1>[332] The first unofficial rumors out of 
Moscow were confirmed by an Associated Press dispatch on April 12 that 
translated an official Soviet news agency Tass announcement: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The world's first space ship Vostok with a man on board, has been 
  launched on April 12 in the Soviet Union on a round-the-earth orbit.
  <P>The first space navigator is Soviet citizen pilot Maj. Yuri Alekseyevich 
  Gagarin. Bilateral radio communication has been established and is maintained 
  with Gagarin.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>Aside from this assertion, the news out of Moscow 
and Turkestan on April 12 was neither crisp nor very detailed. For a few days a 
great deal of speculation over conflicting reports, fuzzy photographs, and the 
lack of eyewitnesses encouraged those disappointed Westerners who wished to 
believe that Gagarin's flight in <I>Vostok I</I> (meaning East) had not 
occurred. The danger that history might be made to order in a closed society was 
compounded by the rumors in the <I>London</I> <I>Daily Worker</I> and elsewhere 
since April 7. The propagandistic exploitation of this magnificent deed was 
evident from the fact that no confirmed announcement was made during the 108 
minutes of flight - not until Yuri Gagarin landed intact near the Volga River, 
some 15 miles south of the city of Saratov. The present tense in the Tass 
dispatch above could easily have been doctored for control purposes, drama, or 
even for more serious reasons.<A

<P>Be that as it may, NASA officials from Webb and Dryden down to Gilruth and 
Powers, at least six months earlier, had planned their comments for this 
occasion, just in case. About 4 a.m., telephones began buzzing up and down the 
east coast of the United States as reporters demanded responses from NASA 
officials to the Tass dispatch. John A. "Shorty" Powers half-consciously replied 
to his first inquisitor, "We're all asleep down here." Some journalists ignored 
the fact that Gilruth had long since gone on record as saying he would not be 
surprised to be awakened some morning in this manner. Webb went on nationwide 
network television at 7:45 a.m. to extend congratulations to the Soviets, to 
express NASA's disappointment, and to reassure the nation that Project Mercury 
would not be stampeded or panicked into a premature speedup of the Mercury 
timetable. The next morning Webb and Dryden were roasted before the verbal fire 
of the House space committee as they were asked to explain what had happened. 
All the information available to the United States government, said Dryden, and 
past experience with Soviet technical statements, tended to confirm the report 
of Gagarin's flight. Representatives James G. Fulton of Pennsylvania, J. Edgar 
Chenoweth of Colorado, Victor L. Anfuso of New York, and David S. King of Utah 
were especially disappointed that the name Gagarin would "go down in the history 
books." Webb and Dryden held up well under this heat, taking the position that 
this particular race was lost "before the space agency was founded." But 
Representative Joseph E. Karth, a Democrat from [333] Minnesota, gave the most 
popular rationale of why a Russian had won the first lap in the manned space 
race: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The United States and the Soviet Union have proceeded along two 
  different lines of attack. The Soviets have pretty much rifled their program, 
  if I may use the word, as opposed to the United States shotgunning their 
  effort. We have been interested in many programs and I think the Soviets have 
  been interested primarily in putting a man in space.<A

<P><CITE>Project Mercury normal orbital mission profile.</CITE> 
<P>
<HR>

<P>The flight of the first cosmonaut seemed remarkably similar in many respects 
to the plans for the first Mercury astronaut's orbital mission, but there were 
momentous differences as well - the single near-polar orbit, the lack of a 
worldwide tracking network, and the provisions for pilot ejection before 
impact.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-8.htm#source85"><SUP>85</SUP></A> 
According to the corrected and reduced data obtained from their measurements and 
published in <I>Pravda</I> on April 25, 1961, the twin module 
spaceship-satellite, or <I>Korabl Sputnik VI</I>, was renamed generically as the 
first in the Vostok series. Specifically its call sign was <I>Swallow</I>. The 
payload compartment, manned by 27-year-old, 154-pound Gagarin, weighed 
altogether 10,417 pounds, and attained [334] an apogee of 203 miles and a 
perigee of 112 miles, with an orbital inclination of 65 degrees to the equator. 
Cosmonaut Gagarin was probably launched by a two-stage booster from the Baikonur 
cosmodrome, east of the Aral Sea, south of the industrial district of 
Magnitogorsk, near Tyura Tam, a boom town comparable to Cocoa Beach, Florida. 
Apparently the Gagarin flight had not been preceded by a parabolic manned 
suborbital flight into space. The anonymous engineers behind him, mysteriously 
called "the chief designer" and "the chief engineer," evidently had developed a 
mixed-gas air supply at sea-level pressures for his life support system. Vostok 
I also had a separate and separable instrument section and retrorocket package 
for telemetry, television, and radio telephone communications during orbit and 
for braking the spacecraft velocity 5,000 miles and 30 minutes before the 
desired impact point. Gagarin rode in a capsule almost three times the weight of 
the Mercury spacecraft and inside a spherical pressure vessel 7.5 feet in 
diameter, both of which were automatically controlled. Gagarin was the first 
person in history to attain an Earth-fixed speed of 17,400 miles per hour, and 
at this speed around his 25,000-mile course, as high as 203 miles from sea 
level, he was also the first man ever to endure 89 minutes of weightlessness.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-8.htm#source86"><SUP>86</SUP></A>
<P>What the Soviets announced after the fact was indeed true: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>History's first flight in outer space, accomplished by the Soviet 
  cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in the space ship Vostok, has made it possible to draw 
  the immensely important scientific conclusion that manned flights in space are 
  practicable. It demonstrated that man can normally bear up against the 
  conditions of a space flight, the placing of a ship in orbit, and the return 
  to earth. This flight showed that in a state of weightlessness man fully 
  retains his capacity for work, his coordination of movements, and his clarity 
  of thought.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-8.htm#source87"><SUP>87</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>And 
while it was hardly an overstatement to claim, as the Soviets did after the 
celebrations in Red Square were over, that "in the progress of science, the 
flight of a Soviet man in outer space pushed all other developments into the 
background," it must certainly have been an oversimplification that prompted 
Gagarin to say in retrospect: "I felt very well before the flight. I was fully 
confident of its successful outcome. Our machines and equipment are very 
reliable and I and all my comrades, the scientists, engineers and technicians, 
never doubted the success of the undertaking."<A

<P>Gagarin's flight, while not having the depressive impact of <I>Sputnik I</I> 
in October 1957, nonetheless came as a crushing disappointment to many 
Americans. The announcement was received in this country with a variety of 
reactions: admiration for the flight's purely scientific merits; disbelief, 
since various Russian accounts carried conflicting statements, at least in 
transliteration and at most in their technical secretiveness; and the feeling 
that the United States had lost face once again. The Associated Press conducted 
a poll in Miami, Detroit, Akron, Charlotte, Denver, Dallas, Minneapolis, Los 
Angeles, Oklahoma City, and Washington, D.C., by having its reporters call all 
the Joe Smiths in the telephone directories. The Joe Smiths registered a wide 
range of emotions, but perhaps [335] the persons feeling the keenest 
disappointment were the American astronauts. They knew how close and yet how far 
they had come toward being first in space, if not in orbit. Of the four who made 
statements, Glenn was most articulate and magnanimous: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Russian accomplishment was a great one. It was apparently very 
  successful and I am looking forward to seeing more detailed information. I am, 
  naturally, disappointed that we did not make the first flight to open this new 
  era. The important goals of Project Mercury, however, remain the same - ours 
  is peaceful exploration of space. These first flights, whether Russian or 
  American, will go a long way in determining the direction of future endeavors. 
  There is certainly work for all to solve the tremendous problems involved. I 
  hope the Russians have the same objectives and that we can proceed with mutual 
  dissemination of information so that these goals which all mankind shares can 
  be gained rapidly, safely, and on a progressive scientific basis.<A

and the press whether Gagarin's flight was in fact a complete orbit, since it 
apparently fell short of its starting point by a few miles.
