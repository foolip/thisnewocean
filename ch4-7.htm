<H1>Other Means to the Same End</H1>Besides Man-in-Space-Soonest of the Air 
Force, there were two other manned military space ventures seeking approval from 
ARPA in the summer of 1958. A rather heated competition was underway among the 
three armed services in the area of manned space flight. The Army's entry, much 
simpler than the Air Force approach, was supposed to lift a man into the space 
region "sooner" than Soonest. After the Sputniks, von Braun and his colleagues 
at Redstone Arsenal had had great success resuscitating their instrumented 
satellite project. Now they had unearthed one of their old proposals for using a 
modified Redstone to launch a man in a sealed capsule along a steep ballistic, 
or suborbital, trajectory. The manned capsule would reach an altitude of 
approximately 150 miles before splashing into the Atlantic about the same 
distance downrange from Cape Canaveral. The passive passenger would be housed in 
an ejectable cylindrical compartment about four feet wide by six feet long, 
which in turn would be housed in an inverted version of the kind of nose cone 
used on the Jupiter IRBM.<A

<P>The Army tried to justify the proposal partly as a step toward improving 
techniques of troop transportation. But, more important, such a ballistic shot 
supposedly could be carried out during 1959; this would recoup some of the 
prestige captured by the Soviet satellite launchings as well as furnish some 
much-needed medical information, especially regarding high g loading and the 
effect of about six minutes of weightlessness. Initially called "Man Very High," 
the [100] project called for the support of all three services. The sealed 
compartment would be modeled closely on the Air Force Manhigh balloon gondola 
then being used in a series of record-breaking ascents. In April the Air Force, 
already overloaded with plans for its own Dyna-Soar and manned satellite 
projects, had decided not to participate. So the Army had renamed the plan 
"Project Adam" and had begun pushing it as an Army project, with Navy 
cooperation expected in the medical and recovery phases.<A

<P>The Adam proposal began the formal climb from the Army Ballistic Missile 
Agency through the Pentagon hierarchy to the office of the Secretary of the 
Army, then to ARPA. It came under very heavy criticism from sources both inside 
and outside the Defense Department. The ARPA Man in Space Panel unequivocally 
recommended that the proposal be turned down. Hugh Dryden of NACA told the House 
Space Committee that "tossing a man up in the air and letting him come back . . 
. is about the same technical value as the circus stunt of shooting a young lady 
from a cannon. . . ." And Arthur Kantrowitz of Avco, whose company was still 
trying to get the Air Force manned satellite contract, termed Adam "another 
project which is off the main track because I feel that weightlessness is not 
that great a problem."<A

<P>On July 11, ARPA Director Johnson notified Secretary of the Army Wilbur M. 
Brucker that ARPA did not consider Project Adam a practical proposal for manned 
space flight. Consequently the Army could not expect to receive the $10-12 
million it requested for the "up-and-down" project. Early in August, Brucker, 
mentioning that the Central Intelligence Agency had expressed an interest in 
Adam, defended the approach as a potential "national political psychological 
demonstration." Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald A. Quarles replied that in 
light of the Soviet achievement of orbiting an animal, the Air Force 
man-in-space project, and the creation of NASA, a decision on Project Adam would 
have to await "further study." In succeeding months the controversial "lady from 
a cannon" plan slipped quietly into the inactive category at Redstone Arsenal.<A

<P>Still a third military proposal for manned space flight came forth during the 
contentious first half of 1958. In April the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics 
presented to ARPA the results of its manned satellite study, cleverly 
acronymized "MER I" (for "Manned Earth Reconnaissance"). This approach called 
for an orbital mission in a novel vehicle - a cylinder with spherical ends. 
After being fired into orbit by a two-stage booster system, the ends would 
expand laterally along two structural, telescoping beams to make a delta-wing, 
inflated glider with a rigid nose section. The configuration met the principal 
MER I requirement: the vehicle would be controllable from booster burnout to 
landing on water. Fabric construction obviously implied a new departure in the 
design of reentry vehicles. At ARPA's direction the Bureau of Aeronautics 
undertook a second study (MER II), this one to be done jointly on contract by 
Convair, manufacturer of the Atlas, and the Goodyear Aircraft Corporation. [101] 
The Convair-Goodyear study group did not make its report until December. At that 
time it reasserted the feasibility of the lifting pneumatic vehicle but 
relegated the inflation of the craft to the postentry portion of the mission.<A

By December, however, Project Mercury already was moving ahead steadily under 
NASA. Funds for a MER III phase (model studies) were not forthcoming from the 
Defense Department, and the intriguing MER concept became a little-known aspect 
of the prehistory of manned orbital flight.
<P>MER, sometimes referred to as "Project MER," was by far the most ambitious of 
the manned space flight proposals made by the military in 1958. Its emphasis on 
new hardware and new techniques meant it really had little chance for approval 
then. Conversely, Project Adam was not ambitious enough for the time and money 
involved. Of the three military proposals, Man-in-Space-Soonest came closest to 
full program approval. But by August the Air Force's hopes for putting a man 
into orbit sooner than the Soviet Union, or than any other agency in this 
country, were fading rapidly before the growing consensus that manned space 
flight should be the province of the civilian space administration.

<P><A name=source82><SUP>82</A> </SUP>"Development Proposal for Project Adam," 
Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Redstone Arsenal, Ala., April 17, 1958. The Adam 
concept involved use of drag flaps to slow the nose cone's rate of descent and 
provide aerodynamic stability during reentry. At lower altitudes, parachutes 
would deploy to slow the capsule down still more. The development plan for Adam 
specified that several primate flights would precede the first manned shot. 
Unquestionably the most unusual technical aspect of Adam, and one that later 
produced considerable amusement among the engineers who directed Project 
Mercury, was the tank filled with water, into which the payload would be tossed 
by an automatic mechanism in case of booster malfunction on the launch pad.
