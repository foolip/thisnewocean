<H2>Chapter XIV<BR>
Climax of Project Mercury</H2>
<P>[461] WALTER M. Schirra, a naval aviator who
had won the Distinguished Flying Cross for his combat missions over Korea,
received his most important assignment to date on July 27, 1962. It was the
flight plan for Mercury-Atlas 8, a six-orbit flight that was to qualify the
spacecraft and man's endurance for an extended spatial mission. A new plan,
revised slightly for yaw-reference experiments using the periscope, was
delivered on August 8. This was almost 60 days before the mission, allowing the
period for training that Scott Carpenter had recommended. Carpenter had received
his MA-7 document late, and major revisions had been inserted almost until
launch day. Although Schirra's flight plan was altered in September, it did
escape a thorough last-minute rewrite.
<P>MA-8 was to be an engineering flight, in contrast with the exploratory nature
of Glenn's flight in MA-6 and the developmental and scientific nature of MA-7.
Schirra was expected to concern himself largely with the management and
operation of the spacecraft's systems to conserve hydrogen peroxide attitude
control fuel and electrical power. The MSC planners had examined the
minute-by-minute details from launch to recovery in the interest of spacecraft
endurance and had programmed only a few experiments that would require fuel or
electrical power. The pilot was to try to observe a ground xenon light of
140-million candlepower at Durban, South Africa, and four flares of 1-million
candlepower each that would be launched near Woomera, Australia. The only other
experiment requiring astronaut participation included some weather and
terrestrial photography as the pilot sighted targets of opportunity. Besides
these experiments, several passive test devices were superimposed on the
spacecraft's exterior. Eight ablation panels, consisting of several types of
material, were fused onto the afterbody's beryllium shingles, and a white paint
patch was brushed on the capsule's side for still more evaluations of spatial
thermal effects on various materials.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>Early in August, Schirra trained energetically for a targeted September
launch; spacecraft No. 16 was almost ready for a simulated flight in Hangar S;
and Atlas No. 113-D had arrived at the Cape. Then on August 11, the Soviet
Union, [462] without prior announcement, launched <I>Vostok III</I>. NASA
leaders, who had endured much needling on the space gap since Gherman S. Titov's
17-orbit flight, a little more than a year earlier, grimly read the press
reports. The five-ton Vostok spacecraft, with Major Andrian G. Nikolayev aboard,
was in an orbit with a 156-mile apogee and a 113-mile perigee, inclined (as
usual for Vostoks) at 65 degrees.
<P>The "gap" seemed to become a "gulf" the following day, when <I>Vostok IV</I>,
carrying Lieutenant Colonel Pavel R. Popovich, shot into an orbit with an apogee
of 157 miles and a perigee of 112 miles. Soon after the second launch, Nikolayev
reported that he had sighted Popovich's spacecraft. Western tracking stations
variously reported that the two craft were as close as 3 and as far as 300 miles
apart. Intercepted communications between Nikolayev (code-named Falcon) and
Popovich (Golden Eagle) caused serious speculation that the Vostoks might try to
rendezvous, but apparently no such attempt was made.
<P>On August 15, Nikolayev landed after 64 orbits and more than 95 hours in
space. Popovich touched down six minutes later, after 48 orbits and more than 70
hours' flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
The U.S. decision to accelerate the space program called for by President
Kennedy in May 1961 seemed more than validated to most critical observers.
Meanwhile engineers who were designing what became the Gemini vehicle for
rendezvous with an orbiting Agena rocket studied the possibility of adding a
space-maneuvering capability to Mercury. On August 24, Kenneth S. Kleinknecht,
the Project Office chief, reported that such an innovation would require at
least 400 pounds of additional spacecraft hardware and fuel. Upon hearing this,
Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., the Mercury flight director, dourly observed that
this added weight might dangerously degrade the capsule's chances of reaching
orbit, but Robert R. Gilruth asked Kleinknecht to continue his studies. A few
days later the Mercury Project Office and the Flight Crew Operations Division
handed the MSC director a joint proposal for maneuvering an orbiting Mercury
spacecraft close to a passive Echo-type satellite. But because of time, weight,
and safety considerations, Gilruth and his management lieutenants rejected the
proposal, abandoned the idea of a maneuverable Mercury spacecraft for the time
being, and turned back to the more prosaic but essential business of preparing
for the modest doubled-distance, six-orbit flight slated for Walter Schirra.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>

<H3>Longer Legs for Mercury</H3>Specific planning for MA-8 had begun back in
February during the technical debriefing of John Glenn following the MA-6
mission. While attending the Grand Turk Island meetings, Kleinknecht and Donald
K. Slayton had agreed that a flight of six or seven orbits seemed to be a
logical intermediate step from the three-pass flight of Glenn toward an ultimate
18-orbit goal then under study. When Kleinknecht returned to his office (then at
Langley) he put his staff to work in conjunction with John F. Yardley's group of
McDonnell engineers on the changes necessary to accomplish a seven-orbit Mercury
flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<P>[463] The staff's problem was to appraise the spacecraft components' lifetime
in terms of the ability of each system to perform two or three times longer than
the operating limits originally built into them. Flight rules so far had
specified an almost continuous operation of the automatic stabilization and
control system, which caused a heavy drain on the spacecraft's electrical power
supply. Also critical were oxygen reserves, reaction control fuel supplies, and
increased recovery requirements. The tracking and communications network, built
for three-orbit coverage, would require extensive modification if the tracking
criteria applied to three orbits should apply to six or seven.
<P>The three-orbit Mercury spacecraft, with all its electrically powered systems
in action, consumed about 7080 watt-hours of battery power from a total of
about 13,500 watt-hours available. Thus a seven-orbit mission, obeying previous
flight rules, would consume about 11,190 watt-hours, leaving a reserve supply of
only 6.7 percent. Mercury Project Office engineers insisted there should be at
least a 10 percent postlanding reserve as a safety factor and suggested at least
two conservation methods to attain and surpass this amount. One was drawn from
an earlier recommendation presented by McDonnell designers and planners; they
had outlined possibilities for an 18-orbit mission, proposing that some of the
systems be turned off during a substantial portion of the flight. In addition to
this, the MSC engineers recommended switching telemetry transmitter and radar
beacon operations to ground command. These measures, they felt, would raise the
reserve power levels to about 15 percent.
<P>After studying the spacecraft's environmental control system, the project
engineers at MSC concluded that about 4.4 pounds of oxygen would be consumed
during a seven-orbit flight, taking pilot usage and cabin leakage rates into
consideration. By prevailing mission rules, this would leave an insufficient
supply to meet possible contingencies of abnormal recovery. A supply of 8.6
pounds would meet the requirement, but the system carried only two 4-pound
capacity bottles. So, either the rules had to be relaxed or the system had to be
modified. The MSC study group recommended the modification possibility, adding
that a strenuous program to reduce cabin leakage rates to 600 cubic centimeters
per minute should be started. Formerly up to 1000 cubic centimeters had been
within design specifications. To cover the increase in carbon dioxide production
from the longer flight, the project office planners pointed out that the
canister carried in the three-orbit spacecraft could be filled with lithium
hydroxide to its 5.4 pound capacity. This amount represented an increase from
the 4.6 pounds that had been carried on the three-pass flights and should be
sufficient extension of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> removal capability.
<P>At the same time that these efforts were being made to provide the spacecraft
systems with all the power they needed and the astronaut with enough breathable
oxygen, some NASA and McDonnell engineers were wrestling with more advanced
problems of tripling, quadrupling, and even raising by factors of six and eight
the capabilities of the Mercury spacecraft to orbit Earth. But at this stage,
planning for the day-long, 18-orbit mission depended heavily on some positive
proof [464] from MA-8 that man and machines could tolerate, over a longer period
and with larger margins for pilot safety and mission success, the vacuous,
weightless, hot-cold extremes of space.
<P>The most critical problem in preparations for the extended mission was
providing enough hydrogen peroxide fuel to power the capsule's reaction control
system. A seven-orbit mission operating in the fully automatic control mode
would consume about 28 pounds of fuel, providing the systems were functioning
normally. The Mercury Project Office suggested alternating a combination of
automatic and manual modes to provide safer fuel reserves at the end of the
flight. Such a procedure would expend 23 pounds of automatic and 18 pounds of
manual fuel, leaving reserves of 12 and 15 pounds, respectively. Then, in case
of malfunction in one of the control modes, the astronaut would be assured of an
adequate fuel supply in the other mode.
<P>Recovery procedures changed considerably for the proposed seven-orbit
mission. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh sinusoidal curves of the orbital
ground trace passed over geographical points that almost intersected, while the
fifth and sixth orbits did intersect in the northern Pacific about 275 miles
northeast of Midway Island. This pattern shifted to the Pacific Ocean the
optimum recovery area that had been in the Atlantic for MA-4 through MA-7.
Kleinknecht's staff pointed out that a once-an-orbit primary recovery capability
could be maintained with only a slight increase in the recovery forces. The
primary landing area during the seventh orbit could be covered easily by Navy
vessels moving to the zone from their base at Pearl Harbor, but some of the
aircraft staging bases for past contingency landing areas would have to be
relocated.
<P>Then Sigurd A. Sjoberg, Robert F. Thompson, and other mission and recovery
planners discovered a slight flaw in the seven-orbit flight profile. A hard
mission rule required a contingency recovery capability within 18 hours after
landing. This requirement could be easily met for a six-orbit mission, but
adding a seventh orbit required additional recovery forces to satisfy that
mission rule. So NASA decided to make MA-8 a six-orbit flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
<P>During August 1962 the MA-8 mission planners continued to wrestle with many
other operational considerations. But within the month they were able to issue
the mission rules, data acquisition plan, a slight revision to the flight plan,
recovery requirements and procedures, and the mission directive, only to find on
some occasions that closer study of engineering preparations revealed new
constraints, requiring minor changes to most of their guidebooks.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>

<H3>Preparations for MA-8</H3>While the long-duration mission studies were in
progress and the mission rules and directives were being prepared and issued,
other personnel of the NASA-military-industry complex were readying the
spacecraft, booster, and recovery forces. The astronaut and alternate pilot were
in intensive training.
<P>[465] The Manned Spacecraft Center allocated spacecraft Nos. 16 and 19 for
the six-orbit mission, with No. 16 as the preferred vehicle. No. 16 had arrived
at Cape Canaveral in January 1962, while No. 19 had followed two months later.
Rework to incorporate a six-orbit capability was done at the Cape by the MSC
Preflight Operations Division with the help of McDonnell technicians. The work
and testing began slowly but were well underway in April. In that month
temperature surveys at the critical points on the capsule were completed, the
environmental control system passed its altitude-chamber tests, and the reaction
control system was exercised satisfactorily. Minor troubles cropped up, as
usual. Emergency oxygen rate valves stuck. Water coolant flowed too freely. The
cabin's oxygen leakage rate was too high. Each difficulty slowly was overcome,
but it became evident that a hoped-for August launching might slip at least a
month.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
<P>The Mercury Project Office had pronounced 5.4 pounds of lithium hydroxide
sufficient for oxygen purification for the MA-8 mission, but the MSC Life
Systems Division personnel checking this theory found the absorbers
unsatisfactory. Canisters containing 4.6 pounds of the mixture had been used in
the three-orbit spacecraft and tests showed that this amount of the chemical
functioned to keep the air breathable for 34.5 hours before carbon-dioxide
levels rose too high. Then canisters supposedly containing 5.4 pounds of
absorbent were tested, with both fixed and variable inputs of heat, water vapor,
and carbon dioxide, and with a human subject breathing the oxygen. To the
amazement of the testers, the lifetimes of these canisters averaged only
slightly higher than those that were partly filled.
<P>Then it occurred to somebody in the division to weigh the canisters. Each
proved to have been packed about half a pound short. Finally the completely
filled canisters were tested for as long as 71 hours before breaking down,
demonstrating that the original design met the development demands, after all.
Well-filled absorbers would qualify for a day-long mission as well as for six
orbits.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>As the work continued at the Cape on spacecraft No. 16, Scott Carpenter made
his fuel-thirsty, three-orbit flight on May 24. During <I>Aurora 7</I>'s
postflight analysis MSC engineers, including G. Merritt Preston's checkout crew,
took new and closer looks at the attitude and reaction control systems. They
decided that attitude thrusters slightly different in design would have to be
installed in the MA-8 spacecraft. While Preston's men were implementing this
decision, they also managed to get No. 16's cabin oxygen leakage rate down to a
highly satisfactory 460 cubic centimeters per minute, although in the weeks
ahead this rate would rise slightly.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>Other results from MA-7, as recorded from telemetry data, as reported by
Carpenter, and as revealed by examination of flight-tested <I>Aurora 7</I>, had
intensified the flurry of activity all along the line to prepare No. 16 for its
flight. Carpenter had many suggestions regarding spacecraft configuration. The
heavy periscope, he said, was useless on Earth's nightside; the window alone
could be used to find the spacecraft's attitude. The determined workers for
spacecraft weight [466] reduction were delighted to hear this assessment. But
the MA-7 postflight inspection team reported that Carpenter's landing error had
been caused by a faulty yaw attitude, largely because Carpenter had performed a
final control systems check just prior to retrofire and had used the window
mainly as his chief yaw reference. Could the window and the pilot be trusted?
the Mercury team wondered. Would the periscope have assisted in correcting the
attitude and the resultant overshoot? The only way to find out the answers was
to fly the periscope again.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
<P>So for MA-8 the periscope became, in a sense, an experimental instrument.
Using both the periscope and the window for spacecraft attitude reference,
Schirra would check the position of his capsule carefully on Earth's day and
night sides. Then he would check his visual judgment to gauge attitude,
comparing his ability against the scope and instrument readings.
<P>Having decided to retain the periscope, the mission planners and Cape
preparations team for MA-8 butted into fresh difficulties. The experiment
schedule had called for an ultraviolet airglow spectrograph to be put in the
periscope's well. This spectrograph had been developed through the intensive
work of Albert Boggess, III, at the Goddard Space Flight Center upon the request
of the NASA Headquarters Ad Hoc Committee on Scientific Tasks and Training for
Man-in-Space. Now the decision to carry the periscope forced the withdrawal of
the experiment, creating some disappointment among NASA's scientifically
interested personnel. Even the implementation of this decision turned out to be
somewhat of a problem. Preston's men tried to use the periscope from the
alternate spacecraft (No. 19) but found it to be defective. By the end of August
they managed to install a standard periscope, "cannibalized" from spacecraft No.
15.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>Carpenter, the second astronaut to land with empty fuel tanks in the manned
orbital program, also suggested that a control-mode selector switch be
integrated with the control system to seal off the high thrusters until they
were needed for fast reaction maneuvers. The Project Office approved, and this
fuel-saving switch was installed in the MA-8 spacecraft.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>Aside from these and other minor modifications spacecraft No. 16 was a
duplicate of <I>Aurora 7</I>. Many of the technical changes were aimed at weight
reduction, fuel conservation, and adding extra supplies for a longer mission.
Deletions included the astronaut-observer camera, one of two redundant command
receiver-decoders, and the high-frequency voice transceiver. To increase pilot
comfort and save weight, the preflight preparations crew extracted the lower leg
section of the couch and substituted toe, heel, and knee restraints. During the
orbital phase of the mission, the knee restraints could be loosened. An extra 15
pounds of coolant water and an improved fastening technique for the heatshield
center plug completed the list of additions.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>While the engineers were working, Astronaut Schirra proceeded through the
most efficient flight training program yet undertaken. Except for added yaw-recognition
displays, he used the same procedures trainers that his predecessors
had used; [467] having a definite flight plan, he could practice on his own
specific mission profile. He was able to work through his simulated retrofire
and reentry tasks in the Langley procedures trainer before the device was
dismantled for shipment to Houston. And for personal physical conditioning, he
often went swimming and water skiing.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>Late in July, Preston reported that the work schedule for spacecraft No. 16
was aimed at a September 18 launch date. When the flight preparation crews added
a sixth day to their work week to compensate for various delays, the MSC
managers remained optimistic.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>Some worry among the mission planners had been injected in July when Project
Dominic, an Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) high-atmosphere nuclear test over the
Pacific, had created a new zone of radiation, lower than the Van Allen belts. In
the face of this possible threat to an orbiting man, AEC, NASA, and McDonnell
carefully studied a number of satellite and probe launchings in August designed
to explore the belt. After the solar batteries of several satellites failed -
including <I>Ariel I</I>, the world's first international satellite project,
which developed operational difficulties probably attributable to Dominic - the
investigators reported that the new radiation circled Earth at the geomagnetic
equator and was about 400 miles wide and 4000 miles deep. Sounding rockets by
telemetry data indicated rapid and continuing decay of radioactivity in the
corridors of the next Mercury mission. By the end of August the radiation
hazards seemed negligible. The MSC engineers, distrusting the reports that all
danger had disappeared, installed a radiation dosimeter on the spacecraft hatch,
provided the pilot with a hand-held model, and attached four more to Schirra's
pressure suit.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
The hand-held model could provide real-time indications during the flight.
<P>Besides some labor-management difficulties that momentarily hampered the
activities of the aerospace industry at this time, the booster for MA-8
contributed its share of troubles. Atlas 113-D was to have been delivered to
Cape Canaveral toward the end of July, but it failed its initial composite test
at the San Diego factory. Finally it was shipped on August 8. Then the Air
Force, revealing that its Atlas program had suffered four recent turbopump
failures, advised the Manned Spacecraft Center that No. 113-D would be put
through a flight-readiness static firing. Since the MA-8 launch vehicle would be
the first one in the Mercury program not having the two-second post-ignition
hold-down time, the Air Force felt the static firing to be an important
requirement.
<P>A one-week slippage was now added. But before the test could be made, the Air
Force and Convair inspectors found a fuel leak in a seam weld on the booster.
Calculating the time required for work to be done, on September 6 the
Mercury-Atlas launch operations committee rescheduled the mechanical and
electrical matings of spacecraft and booster and three planned simulated
flights. These tests would continue through September 24, making October 3 the
most likely day for the MA-8 launch.

<P>[469] Atlas 113-D actually differed little from its predecessors in the
manned flight program. It incorporated a dozen or so technical changes from the
107-D configuration that had propelled Carpenter into orbit. The fuel tank
insulation had been removed as a solution to some of the difficulties that had
beset John Glenn's booster (Carpenter's launch vehicle had retained the
insulation). More important, baffled fuel injectors (which had been found in
static firing tests to virtually eliminate the possibility of combustion
instability) and the accompanying hypergolic ignition (in which fuel and
oxidizer ignite on contact) were added to 113-D. These innovations,
therefore, eliminated the two-second hold-down at ignition, saved fuel, made for
smoother initial combustion, and provided a safer liftoff.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>The tracking network for MA-8 was augmented by five airborne relay stations,
in the form of five Air Force C-130s, to cover areas that otherwise would have
been out of communications range of the ground sites. The C-130s, each equipped
with ultra-high-frequency and very-high-frequency equipment for voice relay,
were based at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida; Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto
Rico; and Midway Island.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
The mixed recovery force, deployed by the Department of Defense, included 19
ships in the Atlantic and nine in the Pacific. Aircraft numbering 134 of various
types covered primary and secondary spacecraft landing areas. In all, about
17,000 men, including over 100 aeromedical monitors and specialists, made up the
global MA-8 recovery forces.
<P>Recovery commanders in the Pacific directed a training course in spacecraft
and astronaut retrieval for appropriate teams, using boilerplate capsules,
flotation collars, and other gear provided by MSC. Major General Leighton I.
Davis and Walter C. Williams made an inspection tour to the Pacific to evaluate
the training program and the overall recovery readiness picture. Later Kraft,
reading their findings, reported that preparations and materials seemed
"reasonably well" developed. But he was disappointed that NASA had been unable
to enlist the support of another Navy radar ship equipped with FPS-16 equipment
for C-band operation and thus had to rely on two S-band ships instead. Kraft
felt that S-band radar, called "Verlort" for its 700-mile "very long range
tracking" ability, was less reliable than the C-band.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>If recovery was to go smoothly, interservice misunderstandings like the one
that had developed during Carpenter's rescue would have to be avoided. General
Davis, the DOD military representative for Mercury support operations, had
reported to Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara that the delay at Mercury
Control in the decision to pick up Carpenter had stemmed partially from a lack
of direct communication with the astronaut. To overcome this breakdown, the
recovery room in the Control Center was modified to permit almost instantaneous
communication between tracking stations and recovery forces; and Schirra's
spacecraft was equipped with a long extension line, which would permit him to
maintain voice contact even in the life raft. The extended period of suspense
that climaxed Carpenter's mission should never happen again in Project
Mercury.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>[470] At this juncture, President Kennedy set out on a tour of the space
centers of the South to inspect and show his interest not only in the
preparations for MA-8 but also in the vast array of technological talents being
mobilized for the accelerated space program, including the first lunar voyage.
Kennedy flew down to Cape Canaveral to see the Merritt Island Launch Area that
was being built for the huge Saturn V rockets. Then he went on to Houston to see
the site for the management and control center on the Texas coastal prairie.
Before a sweltering crowd half-filling the 72,000-seat Rice University stadium,
the President spoke on September 12, 1962, in earnest defense of his proclaimed
program for manned exploration of the Moon. "No man can fully grasp how far and
how fast we have come," said Kennedy. "The exploration of space will go ahead,
whether we join it or not. . . . It is one of the great adventures of all time,
and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay
behind in the race for space. . . . We intend to be first. . . . to become the
world's leading space-faring nation." The youthful President then addressed one
of his memorable statements to those who had asked, "Why send a man to the
Moon?"
<BLOCKQUOTE>We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be
  gained and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the
  progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all
  technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for
  good or ill depends on us, and only if the United States occupies a position
  of preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of
  peace or a new, terrifying theater of war. . . . Space can be explored and
  mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistake that
  man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.<A
  href="notes.htm#n14.21"><SUP>21</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>If
President Kennedy's remarks in Houston, later at the McDonnell factory in St.
Louis, and elsewhere, proved an accurate reflection of most Americans'
sentiments about the space program, his words persuaded few of the vocal
economic, political, and scientific conservatives who were watching costs soar
along with the engineering effort. The NASA space budget alone for this fiscal
year was over $5 billion, which represented a tax of about 40 cents on each
American per week; but the Nation was prosperous, the economy seemed sound, and
critics of the "space circus" were seldom heard.

<P>Toward the end of September, all mission preparations, the astronaut, the
spacecraft, and the launch vehicle reached a high state of readiness. The
spacecraft and the booster mated well; the simulated tests before mission ticked
off without further hitches; and October 3 thus remained a promising launch
date.
<P>Schirra, viewing the elaborate preparation effort, studying his flight plan,
and knowing that his mission involved the evaluation of the capsule's ability to
accomplish a day-long flight, recognized the immensity of the engineering effort
behind him. In honor of these labors, he selected the name <I>Sigma 7</I> for
his spacecraft. "Since this was to be an engineering evaluation," he explained,
the name chosen for capsule No. 16 was that of an engineering symbol for
summation, Sigma, [471] with the number seven added to it for the seven-member
Mercury astronaut team. "Thus," he said, "was derived the name and symbol that
was painted on the spacecraft, Sigma 7."<A
href="notes.htm#n14.22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>On the final lap toward launch day, Schirra began a controlled diet on
September 21; nine days later physician Howard A. Minners placed him on his
low-residue diet. Schirra complained mildly while adjusting to the low-residue
food, but in every other respect he was primed and ready, mentally and
physically.
<P>As always when flight day neared, the Mercury operations team through the
Weather Bureau support group kept a watchful eye on existing weather
disturbances in both the Atlantic and Pacific areas. About 400 miles north by
northeast of Puerto Rico, tropical storm Daisy churned the waters of the
Atlantic, while three typhoons, Dinah, Emma, and Frieda, whipped Pacific waves.
On October 1, Walter Williams told the news corps covering the flight at the
Cape that except for the weather "all elements of the MA-8 flight are in a go
condition as of this time." By 5 p.m. the following day, Williams was satisfied
with the chances for success and decided to launch as planned.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
<P>Notified by Williams that he had a 7 o'clock liftoff "appointment" the next
morning, Schirra dined leisurely and retired early. Without any sleep-inducing
medications, the pilot drifted into slumber shortly after 8 p.m. and got about
five hours of sound rest. Minners roused Schirra at 1:40 a.m. to begin the
precise readiness routine. The astronaut showered, shaved, and met with Gilruth,
Williams, Slayton, and Minners for breakfast. He ate heartily the "astronaut
launching breakfast," [472] consisting of eggs, filet, dry toast, orange juice,
and coffee, plus a portion of a bluefish that he had speared the day before. The
major preflight physical having taken place two days earlier, Minners checked
Schirra briefly, pronouncing him in excellent physical condition. After Minners
applied the physiological sensors to the astronaut's body, Schirra signaled to
Joe W. Schmitt to assist him in donning the silvery pressure suit. At a little
past 4 o'clock, Schirra and his attending retinue emerged from Hangar S.
<P>As Schirra headed for the transfer van, Alvin B. Webb, a veteran
space-newsman assigned by the press pool to report activities in that area,
observed that the astronaut seemed to be unusually relaxed and smiling, as
compared to previous astronauts on their way to the launch pad. Seconds later,
Schirra, carrying his portable air conditioner, climbed aboard the van for a
leisurely ride toward the flood-lit spire in the distance. As the van reached
the blockhouse and gantry complex, Byron G. MacNabb, representing the
Convair-Atlas team, greeted Schirra and said: "On behalf of the crew of Pad 14,
I wish you a successful flight and a happy landing." Acknowledging this
salutation, Schirra boarded the elevator and moved up the gantry. At 4:41 a.m.
the astronaut slid inside <I>Sigma 7</I>.<A

<H3>The Textbook Flight</H3>As October 3, 1962, dawned, television viewers and
radio listeners in the United States faced the day with a spectacular
doubleheader in store: in the new "world series" in space, the orbiting of a
third American; in the older World Series on Earth, the opening baseball game
between the New York Yankees and the San Francisco Giants. Many dials switched
later in the day to the traditional nine-inning sports event, but two of the
three major networks continued to compete for the attention of Americans with
minute-by-minute coverage of <I>Sigma 7</I>'s six orbits.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
<P>Schirra slipped into his capsule, buckled himself comfortably in the couch,
and smiled when he saw an automobile ignition key hanging from the
handcontroller safety latch. This represented a tension breaker provided by the
ground crew. Then he began to inventory his gear inside the cabin - flight-plan
bar charts neatly placed in a slot just below the instrument panel, star charts
arranged in a rack to his side, cameras in place, and accessories stowed in his
ditty bag. When he stuck his hand in the glove compartment, he found some
crinkly plastic wrapped around a soft object that turned out to be a steak
sandwich. Otherwise, everything was as it should be, and Schirra began his
prelaunch checkout tests.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
<P>Outside the spacecraft, technicians busily bolted on the side hatch, and
every bolt sank neatly in its threads. From there on, the countdown proceeded
rapidly until about 6:15 (T minus 45 minutes), when the Canary Island station
reported a malfunction in one of its radar sets. Since this equipment would be
critical in ascertaining the orbital parameters, Williams quickly called a hold
in the countdown. The Canary radar required only 15 minutes to be fixed and for
the next 45 minutes the countdown ticked off with precision.
<P>[473] At 7:15 a.m., the engines of Atlas 113-D roared and the big booster
rose from the pad to rocket Schirra and <I>Sigma 7</I> on their journey through
space. "I have the lift-off," Schirra shouted into his microphone to Slayton in
the Mercury Control Center, "and she feels real nice." Ten seconds above the
pad, however, No. 113-D telemetered signals showing an unexpected clockwise
roll. Both primary and secondary sensors inside the launch vehicle, monitoring
such movements to determine the seriousness of the situation, registered a
rifling roll only 20 percent short of an abort condition. Then, to the relief of
the capsule and booster monitors in the control center, the threatening twist
suddenly smoothed out. Schirra began transmitting the status of his supplies and
systems' operation. After a little more than a minute, he realized that he
seemed to be talking to himself. Glancing around the cockpit, he noted that
evidently the noise associated with max q had incorrectly operated the
sound-activated radio microphone, and so he pushed the button to talk to
Slayton. Surely something should be done to obviate this problem, he thought,
because he needed to keep his hand on the abort handle, or "chicken switch,"
rather than having to press the "talk" button manually.
<P>Schirra listened for booster engine cutoff; it came two seconds earlier than
programmed. He saw a flash of light and smoke reflected from the booster engines
at the time the aft section parted from the sustainer. Seconds later the escape
tower jerked away from the top of <I>Sigma 7</I>, its rocket blast spreading a
spotty film on the window. Sustainer engine acceleration seemed slow, Schirra
mused, but since his escape tower had "really said 'sayonara,'" he could only
wait and see if the sustainer would burn long enough to accelerate him into
orbit. Acceleration seemed to drive on and on, the pilot said, and finally the
sustainer engine cut off, about 10 seconds late. Data registered on the control
panels at the Cape indicated a 15-foot-per-second overspeed that would send
Schirra higher - 176 miles - and faster - 17,557 miles per hour - than any other
astronaut had gone or would go during Project Mercury.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
<P>When <I>Sigma 7</I> parted from its Atlas rocket, Schirra turned on the
auxiliary damping controls to eliminate the spacecraft quivers produced by the
blast of the posigrade rockets. Although he dearly wanted to look out the
spacecraft window at the scene below, Schirra fixed his eyes on the instrument
panel, flipped his attitude control to the fly-by-wire mode, and started a
leisurely four-degree-per-second cartwheel movement to obtain his correct
orbital attitude position. Turnaround, which was deliberately slow to conserve
fuel, used only three-tenths of a pound from a total supply of almost 59 pounds
of hydrogen peroxide. To Schirra the thruster jets operated as if they had been
programmed by a computer, providing tiny single pulse spurts to obtain exactly
the position he desired.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>Now he could look out the window to track the sustainer tankage. Peering at a
prescribed spot, Schirra saw the spent vehicle come into view in the upper left
corner of his "picture" window, just as his predecessors had said it should.
Glenn and Carpenter had mentioned that their tankage appeared to be silvery in
color; to Schirra, his looked almost black, "with a white belly band of frost."
[474] The spent launch vehicle seemed to have completed the same turnaround
maneuver as the spacecraft, because Schirra looked down its nozzle. The <I>Sigma
7</I> pilot saw none of the ice crystals or contrails streaming from the tankage
reported by Carpenter.
<P>Schirra said that the fly-by-wire system that had been redesigned to use only
the low thrusters, if desired, served well to adjust his attitude to track the
spent sustainer. The thrusters responded crisply and cut off without residual
reactions. Tracking the booster seemed even easier than following a target in an
aircraft on an air-to-air gunnery problem. Schirra nevertheless knew that he had
neither the attitude control and maneuvering thrust nor the computational
ability to perform a rendezvous. There were simply too many conditions to be
judged if he were to solve the orbital mechanics task so shortly after
launching. Schirra later expressed the opinion that rendezvous with another
vehicle in space appeared to be possible, but that he believed a pilot would
have to have very precise attitude data to effect a coupling. He confirmed what
students of celestial mechanics already knew, while providing them with a feel
for the problems of perceiving relative motion. Differences in velocity of only
20 to 30 feet per second between two objects in space could be disastrous, he
said.
<P>As Schirra neared the Canary Islands, he turned aside from tracking the
booster to check out the manual-proportional mode of spacecraft control. The
pitching-up maneuver matched well with his experience on the procedures trainer.
As Grissom had done before him in Mercury-Redstone 4, Schirra noted that he
tended to overshoot his desired attitude position and that the manual mode of
control seemed "sloppy" compared with the semi-automatic modes.
Manual-proportional control clearly was not the best way to "park" the
spacecraft in one attitude. A far better method, he learned, was to rely on
fly-by-wire with low thrusters only.
<P>Passing over Nigeria, Schirra transferred spacecraft control to the automatic
stabilization and control system and busily monitored his panel dials. Minutes
later he had traversed the African continent without yielding more than once to
the temptation to watch the panorama passing beneath him. Moving toward
Zanzibar, Schirra began to feel warm. He decided to devote full attention to
this before somebody, as he said later in the postflight debriefing, started
"jumping up and down in the control center" and yanked him out of orbit. Frank
H. Samonski, the environmental control system monitor in the Mercury Control
Center, had also watched the temperature rise. At Mercury Control the suit heat
signal, creeping steadily upward, had indeed caused the ground controllers to
think about terminating the mission after the first circuit. Samonski conferred
with Charles A. Berry, who had relieved Stanley C. White as flight surgeon in
the Control Center. Berry believed that the astronaut was in good condition. He
advised trying a second orbit to see if the suit and its occupant could settle
their temperature differences. Kraft, the flight director, listened to the two
men and decided to give the go-ahead to Schirra for a second orbit. Wrestling
with communications checks and with his suit temperature, he found himself
halfway around the world before the Guaymas station relayed the official green
light for his second orbit.
<P>[475] When the temperature problem first appeared, the control knob setting
was at Position 4. Prior to the flight, Schirra had established a procedure for
just this situation. Rather than rushing to a high setting, he slowly advanced
the knob by half a mark at a time, then waited about 10 minutes to evaluate the
change. Had the valve been advanced too quickly, the heat exchanger might have
frozen and reduced its effectiveness even more. By the time Position 7 was
reached, Schirra was much cooler and felt sure that his temperature problem was
nearing resolution, but for good measure he turned to Position 8. Shortly he
became a little cool, and Samonski recommended that he return to Position 3.5.
Schirra, thinking that some kind of analysis had been performed in the Mercury
Control Center, complied. Immediately noting that the temperature was rising
again, he quickly returned the setting to 7.5 and left it alone for a while.
<P>Rounding Muchea, Australia, on his first pass, Schirra had nosed the small
end of <I>Sigma 7</I> down to watch for the first ground flare launch. He said
that he saw the flare before realizing the flash was only lightning. Shortly
thereafter, Woomera reported flare ignition; the pilot still saw lightning - but
only as a big blob of light, never like the jagged streaks seen nearer Earth.
Again, as on past missions, the flare launching area was cloaked by clouds.
Minutes later, however, he reported seeing the outline of a city, which he
guessed to be Brisbane, Australia.
<P>With careful adjustments, Schirra peered into the periscope on his first
night trip through space, endeavoring to prove its optical advantages. Very
graphically, he finally reported, "I couldn't see schmatze through it. Schmatze
translated means nothing." He, like Carpenter, found the periscope was excess
baggage during the daytime and nearly useless at night. Reaching the morning
side of Earth near Hawaii, he recoiled when the Sun, glaring through the scope,
almost blinded him. Placing a chart over the scope, he commented that it "helps
no end to cover up that blasted periscope."
<P>Though he did not feel rushed in his few tasks, Schirra did notice a
remarkable "speeding up of time" as distance flew by so rapidly. After crossing
the Pacific, he reported to Scott Carpenter at Guaymas, Mexico, "I'm in chimp
configuration," meaning that the capsule systems were all on automatic and
working beautifully. Even the temperature range had now become more comfortable,
and one more adjustment of the knob would end that problem. He then told
Carpenter that he would soon start his first daytime yaw maneuver, using the
window as a reference. Schirra said to Slayton, while sailing over the Cape,
that the "reticle is working well for yaw, as well as for almost any other
attitude." Any object that could be seen on Earth could be centered on the
window reticle long enough to judge yaw misalignment. Always the most difficult
of the three axes to judge precisely, as demonstrated during MA-7, yaw alignment
with the flight path was a major control task to be tested by the MA-8 mission.
Over areas of extreme cloudiness, there was no worry so long as rifts or
thunderheads provided breaks in the blanket of cloud cover. By the end of his
first circuit, Schirra felt he had become so adept in determining yaw attitude
that he could [476] estimate any yaw angle his ship happened to take away from
the flight path.
<P>The pilot for a second time carefully compared his visual ability, both with
and without the periscope, to position the capsule's attitude correctly. He felt
satisfied with the results. He conceded that by using the periscope on high
magnification he could obtain the yaw attitude faster than with the window, but
speed was unnecessary in most cases.
<P>Schirra had to devote much of his time during the first orbit and a good
portion of the second to correcting his suit temperature settings. Perspiration
salted around his mouth as a result of suit inlet temperature reaching 82
degrees F; he became quite thirsty, but he resisted opening the visor so the
suit could have every opportunity to settle in a more comfortable range. Despite
the heat - which he described as comparable to what he had endured mowing his
lawn in Texas on a summer's day - all other aspects of the flight were going
well. <I>Sigma 7</I> had consumed 1.4 pounds of fuel on the first orbit, Schirra
noted as he reported the status of the spacecraft systems. He saw the exterior
particles first reported by Glenn and tapped the cabin wall to obtain the same
shower effect Carpenter reported. Much of his conversation with the tracking
sites involved the status of his suit circuit. He seemed to enjoy talking with
the communicators during his first orbit, but later he would complain that this
became a chore, especially when he was trying to concentrate on his work.
<P>On Earth's nightside, Schirra reported that the Moon made an excellent yaw
reference; after completing and reporting on the yaw maneuver, Schirra told
Slayton in the Mercury Control Center that he had shifted back to the automatic
system. By now the temperature had subsided enough to permit a quick drink of
water. He took the opportunity during this respite to report that all systems
were performing very well. So far he had felt only one unwanted spurt from a
24-pound thruster when he returned to fly-by-wire for a yaw-maneuver exercise.
Becoming a little bored with automatic flight halfway around the world, Schirra
shifted to the manual-proportional system and produced a similar moment of
double authority. About two percent of the manual supply spat out in a pitch-down
motion of the spacecraft. "It was my boo-boo," he confessed.
<P>Over Muchea, Australia, on his second pass, Schirra began a more serious and
considerably more difficult night-yaw experiment. He was to test his ability to
use celestial navigation to align the spacecraft properly. Using star-finder
charts, Schirra was supposed to orient himself by positioning <I>Sigma 7</I> in
relation to known stars or planets and the Moon. Then he was to test his sense
of facing to the right or left of his flight path by watching the apparent
motions of heavenly bodies. The pilot found that the airglow layer was an
excellent reference for pitch and roll. This belt, which appeared very thick
above the horizon, could provide reference for these attitudes quite accurately.
For experimentation with the airglow layer, he positioned <I>Sigma 7</I> so that
it appeared to aim at the upper layer of the belt. The panel indicators then
showed a zero reference in pitch.
<P>[477] Schirra conceded that night-yaw reference could be a bit of a problem.
The field of view from the window did not make it easy to identify the
constellations and find a known star. Preferring to obtain the correct yaw
reference on the daylight side, Schirra seemed to lack confidence in his ability
to effect the night maneuver. To some degree his difficulty stemmed from his
star-finder charts, which had been fixed in their relationship to Earth for a
period up to about 7:16 a.m. on October 3. Schirra, now deep into the second
orbit, knew that his launch time had been 7:15. The difference in time, plus his
restricted field of view, reduced the value of this night-yaw exercise; but as
it turned out, telemetry data received at the Muchea tracking station showed his
error to be only four degrees.
<P>During the night-yaw maneuver, Schirra happened to notice one excellent
celestial pattern that he could use to align the spacecraft in the retrofire
position when it was time to reenter the atmosphere. Checking the panel
indicators against his own observations, he determined that the correct
retrofire attitude would place the planet Jupiter in the upper right-hand corner
of the window, the double-star constellation Grus tracking in from the left side
of the window, and the star Fomalhaut at the top of the window, near the center.
<P>Across the Pacific, Schirra again placed the controls in the automatic, or
"chimp configuration," mode. He chatted with Grissom at the Hawaiian site about
how well the spacecraft's systems were working. Grissom had made some rather
strong points concerning the manual-proportional control operation during his
suborbital flight, and the two astronauts, in a space-to-Earth conversation,
compared notes. Just as Hawaii lost his signal and California picked it up,
Schirra called that the "fireflies" were coming into view. "I have a delightful
report for one John Glenn," he told the California communicator. "I do see
fireflies." Impressed by the view out of the window, even though much of the
California coast was covered with clouds, Schirra remarked to Glenn, "It's kind
of hard to describe all this, isn't it, John?" Suddenly, through rifts in the
clouds, he could see San Clemente Island, off the coastline. Then, looking
northeastward, he saw more of the coastal area come into view, followed by the
Salton Sea, an excellent view of lower California, the ridges of Mount Whitney,
and several roads in the Mojave Desert area.
<P>Although Schirra flew higher than either Glenn or Carpenter, he was rather
unimpressed by the height of his voyage. Psychologically he had prepared himself
for space flight, knowing that he would be flying 10 times higher than he had
ever flown before. But once in space, the number, size, and detail of the
objects he could see with the unaided eye, such as roads and terrain changes,
made him actually feel no higher than he had climbed in an aircraft. "Same old
deal, nothing new," he remarked in debriefing, "might as well be in an airplane
at 40- to 50-thousand feet altitude."
<P>According to his flight plan, if the yaw-reference checks had been
satisfactory <I>Sigma 7</I> would be phased into drifting flight during the
third orbit. [478] After giving Slayton a systems status report, Schirra
proceeded to cage the spacecraft's gyros, cut off its electrical power, and
allow <I>Sigma 7</I> to drift through space. Schirra took this opportunity to
make an old psychomotor experiment that Robert B. Voas a year earlier had asked
to be performed. Choosing three dials on the control panel, he closed his eyes
and attempted to touch the target points. In a total of nine trials, he made
only three errors, the largest being a displacement of some two inches. The
weightless state, he concluded, created no disorientation or new problems in
blindly reaching for his controls.
<P>After that test, Schirra drifted along, reporting his status again to the
Canary station and enjoying a brief period of looking out the window. He
mentioned that his outer pane was streaked with a pinkish-orange film and
surmised that this had emanated from the exhaust gases of the launch escape
rocket. According to his flight plan, he was supposed to eat and drink now;
although he said, "I'm having a ball up here drifting," eat and drink he did -
peaches and ground beef mush from squeeze tubes.
<P>Out over the Indian Ocean, he informed the tracking ship in that vicinity
that he had switched the electrical power back on and gone into fly-by-wire
control to check systems operations after the "powered down," or free-flight,
period. Excitedly, the Indian Ocean ship communicator told Schirra that some of
the crew topside had actually caught sight of <I>Sigma 7</I> for five minutes
and through nine degrees of tracking. Schirra, quite pleased, said, "I'll have
to go by and say hello." The pilot then reported that powering up again
presented no difficulty; all systems worked beautifully, with absolutely no
responses from the high thrusters. Smoothly transferring into the automatic
stabilization and control system, he began to look toward the heavens for
familiar stars. When the Moon failed to show, he went to the fly-by-wire,
low-thruster control to bring it into sight. He identified Cassiopeia during the
process, then said, "There's our friend the Moon." Over Muchea again by this
time, he told the communicator that he had locked the automatic system onto the
disk of the Moon. Mercury Control had alerted the ground stations to pay
particular attention to fuel usage by the thrusters. Canton Island and Kauai,
Hawaii, rolled by underneath with everything working so well that Grissom, at
the Hawaiian station, gave Schirra the official good news that he had a "go" for
the full six orbits.
<P>As <I>Sigma 7</I> came near the California tracking site on its third pass,
Schirra told Glenn, "I'm going to shove off for a relaxation period," meaning he
would cut his electrical power, cage his gyros, and start drifting again.
Schirra's flight schedule now called for experimental observations and
photography. He had to struggle getting the camera out of the ditty bag, but
once out it was weightless, and Schirra easily snapped pictures from Baja,
California to Cuba as <I>Sigma 7</I> drifted along beautifully. Nearing the
Cape, Slayton asked for a radiation reading from the hand-held dosimeter.
Schirra replied that the value was so small that it was nearly unreadable. Then
Kraft himself came on the air to compliment Schirra, to urge him to look for the
giant Echo balloon-shaped satellite on his next pass over [479] Zanzibar, and to
notify him that his voice would be broadcast live for two minutes during his
next flight across North America. The enthusiastic pilot then exclaimed that he
had just drifted into an inverted position (head to Earth) and "for some reason
or another, you can tell that the bowl [spacecraft] is upside down." He saw the
whole eastern coastline of the United States, took a picture of that, and then
another of an interesting cloud formation. Still complaining that the camera was
difficult to extract, he decided not to stow it in the case for a while. As for
Echo, he never saw that (or any other) man-made satellite while in orbit.
<P>Floating through space around the world on his fourth orbit, Schirra took
pictures that struck his fancy, watched the nightfall, recognized several stars
as they appeared, and looked at lightning in the thunderstorms covering portions
of the Australian continent. As he came over the Pacific command ship, he
facetiously reported to Shepard that his hydrogen peroxide had not evaporated
and suggested that they should make some plans, the next time around, about
retrofire countdown. Schirra then tuned on the radar ships <I>Huntsville</I> and
<I>Watertown</I> for a communications check. As Hawaii was sliding by, he told
Grissom that he was in inverted flight and that the impression was similar to
"looking out a railroad train window. You see the terrain going by you." The yaw
attitude of the spacecraft was clearly discernible against this background.
<P>As he approached, head down and looking toward California on his fourth pass,
Schirra joked with Glenn about his "real weird attitude" and transmitted another
short status report. Then at 6 hours, 8 minutes, and 4 seconds elapsed time from
launch, Schirra and Glenn began a dialogue heard by much of the Western world
via radio and television:
<BLOCKQUOTE class="dialog">
  <P><SPAN>Glenn:</SPAN> Okay, Sigma 7. This is Cal Cap Com. You're at 6:08.
  Two minutes on live TV. Go ahead, Wally.
  <P><SPAN>Schirra:</SPAN> Roger, John. Just came out of a powered-down configuration
  where we had the ASCS inverter off. It came up in good shape and will stay on
  now for the rest of the flight. The amps and volts are reading properly. . . .
  I'm coming toward you inverted this time, which is an unusual way for any of
  us to approach California, I'll admit.
  <P><SPAN>Glenn:</SPAN> Roger, Wally. You got anything to say to everyone watching
  you across the country on this thing? We're going out live on this.
  <P><SPAN>Schirra:</SPAN> That sounds like great sport. I can see why you and Scott
  like it. I'm having a trick now. I'm looking at the United States and starting
  to pitch up slightly with this drifting rate. And I see the moon, which I'm
  sure no one in the United States can see as well as I right now.
  <P><SPAN>Glenn:</SPAN> I think you're probably right.
  <P><SPAN>Schirra:</SPAN> Ha-ha, I suppose an old song, "Drifting and Dreaming,"
  would be apropos at this point, but at this point I don't have a chance to
  dream. I'm enjoying it too much.
  <P><SPAN>Glenn:</SPAN> Things are looking real good from here, Wally.
  <P><SPAN>Schirra:</SPAN> Thank you, John. I guess that what I'm doing right now is
  sort of a couple of Immelmanns across the United States.
</BLOCKQUOTE>[480]
And here ended Schirra's epistle from space. Glenn continued the conversation in
relative privacy, asking whether Schirra had noticed anything surprising about
the haze layer. Schirra replied with another understatement - "It's quite
fascinating" - but later he recalled that this phenomenon had been his biggest
spatial surprise. Both Glenn and Carpenter had briefed him on the night view of
the horizon from the heavens, but "it just never did sink in to me that it was
as large in magnitude as it really was." Schirra remarked that the airglow layer
covered about a quarter of his view out the window. When first sighted, he said,
"I thought it was clouds, until stars appeared below."<A
href="notes.htm#n14.29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<P>Halfway through the fourth orbit, liquid collected over the inner surface of
his helmet faceplate, evidently from the water coolant circuit. Although Schirra
was annoyed by this problem for the next two hours, he was thankful that the
suit temperature remained reasonably comfortable. So long as his visor was
sealed, he had to crane his head about inside the helmet to find a clear view
out of the faceplate. He was still reluctant to disturb his suit temperature by
opening his visor to wipe it clean.
<P>Going into his fifth orbit, Schirra told Slayton by radio relay that the
flight had been his first opportunity to relax since the previous December. His
life had suddenly become so sedentary that he gladly used the bungee cord
exerciser to tone up his muscles a bit. "Not exactly walking around," he said,
"but a little bit of stretching." Because <I>Sigma 7</I> was now over the
Yucatan Peninsula, communications with the Cape were a little strained, causing
Slayton to quiz Schirra, "Did you say you'd like to get up and walk around?" The
ground controllers cleared the matter by switching circuits to a relay
communications aircraft.
<P>Schirra now began another check of the manual-proportional attitude controls,
recording a third brief instance of double authority control. Regarding this
latest spew of fuel, he complained that he "really flotched it. It's much too
easy to get into double authority, even with the tremendous logic you have
working on all these systems." His check of all the axes of movement proved that
the manual-proportional system was still in good working order. After this trial
he returned to observing and photographing targets of opportunity.
<P>As he prepared to look for the 140-million candlepower light near Durban,
South Africa, Schirra reported "getting some lighted areas over the southern tip
of Africa. . . . I definitely have a city in sight." Betting that this was Port
Elizabeth, a city a little more than 300 miles to the southwest of Durban,
Schirra did not seem surprised that Durban was being drenched with rain and its
brilliant light was not visible on this pass.
<P>Passing into its fifth revolution of Earth, <I>Sigma 7</I> still performed
beautifully in all respects. Astronaut Schirra had little to tell the ground
tracking station except to repeat how well the systems were working and how
gorgeous were the sights. With each orbit, he was now moving farther from the
beaten track nominal to a three-pass flight, and the periods of silence were
longer. A lighted area appearing much like an airport showed up in what he
surmised were the [481] Philippine Islands. "Possibly it's at Zamboanga," he
guessed, a city on the southwest coast of Mindanao. Minutes later he talked with
Alan B. Shepard aboard the Pacific command ship, reporting with pleasure that
his fuel supply stood at 81 and 80 percent in the automatic and manual tanks,
respectively. His oxygen supply was properly pressurized, and his suit
temperature was at a comfortable 62 degrees. Shepard replied, "Well, I could say
that you were definitely go." Quickly he checked in with the <I>Huntsville</I>
and <I>Watertown</I>, presenting, as he put it, a "hunky dory" report. As the
pilot came over the Kauai station, Grissom fed him the correct retrosequence
time that he should use on his next, and final, pass. Checks with Glenn at Point
Arguello and with Carpenter at Guaymas showed that communications should be good
for checkoff and reentry during the sixth orbit. Schirra then bade farewell to
South America with a "Buenos dias, you-all," to the Quito, Ecuador,
communications relay station.
<P>Going into the sixth orbit, Schirra almost regretfully began his preparations
to return to Earth. On his last pass over South America, heavy cloud coverage
obscured most of the hemisphere but he did catch sight of a large winding river.
He reached for the slow-scan camera and pointed it downward at the surface of
the window to capture the view, making a panoramic shot of the continent that he
thought would aid the Weather Bureau in continental cloud analyses. Then he
stowed the camera, rearranged the contents of the ditty bag and glove
compartment, and began going down the checklist of actions to be accomplished
before retrofire and reentry.
<P>He shifted the control mode from the automatic system to the fly-by-wire,
low-thrusters, and found his command of the system still worked well. He looked
briefly out the window for the lights of Durban, but clouds still hid the glow
of that huge lamp from sight. He closed the faceplate, found it fogging again,
and opened it briefly to wipe the visor clean. The instrument panel showed that
the inverter temperatures were in a good range, that the battery voltage checked
out high, and that the oxygen pressure was holding its mark. Although quite
comfortable, he decided to advance the suit-circuit knob "just a tad to increase
the cooling for reentry," to Position 8. The checkoff proceeded so methodically
that he had time to try another eyes-closed orientation test. He reached for the
manual handle and felt it in his grasp. Then he reached for the emergency handle
but brushed an adjacent radio box before touching it.
<P>Down below, the Indian Ocean ship communicator asked if he needed any help in
completing the pre-retrosequence checklist. "Negative," he replied. All was in
readiness for the last-minute arming of the retrorocket squibs. He waited and
watched until he came in range of Shepard aboard the Pacific command ship. In
the darkness, he viewed a moonset, saw the proper star and planet pattern for
his correctly aligned attitude swing into view, and noticed that one of his
fingertip lights had burned out. Musing out loud for whoever could listen, he
likened his situation once again to riding a train on celestial tracks leading
back toward Earth. Listening to the humming of the systems, he was reminded also
of a ship underway [482] at sea. As a pilot, Schirra curiously refused to
compare his limited control of the spacecraft with his freedom of maneuver in
aircraft.
<P>When he came into range of the Pacific command ship, he glanced at the fuel
levels: 78 percent in both the automatic and manual tanks, the meters read.
Shepard asked him how he stood on the checklist. Completed, with the exception
of arming the rocket squibs, Schirra replied. He told Shepard that his ship was
holding well in the retroattitude mode on the automatic system, that the high
thrusters were in good working order, and that he had the manual-proportional
system in a standby position. With everything set, Shepard gave the countdown to
arm the squibs on the "Mark!" Next came the retrosequence countdown. Eight hours
and 52 minutes after <I>Sigma 7</I> lifted off from the Cape, the first
retrorocket fired. When Schirra punched the button for this action, the tiny
instant of time before the firing "seemed agonizingly long." As each retrorocket
fired crisply at five-second intervals, Schirra was pleasantly amazed that the
spacecraft appeared to hold as steady as a rock. Quickly he checked this
impression with a glance out of the window; the star pattern he could see did
not even appear to quiver. After retrofire he checked the automatic fuel gauge
and found the needle hovering between 52 and 53 percent.
<P>Then Schirra shifted gears to his favorite fly-by-wire, low-thruster mode of
control. He armed the retropack jettison switch and the spent unit spun away.
Shortly after retrofire his attitude control felt "a little bit sloppy," and he
felt himself wobble toward reentry. Although this could have been corrected by
using the low thrusters, he intentionally cut in the high thrusters to get into
position quickly. Schirra pitched <I>Sigma 7</I> up to the 14-degree reentry
attitude with no difficulty and cut in the automatic control mode to damp away
undesirable motions. Then, as the engineers had asked him to do, he turned on
the fuel-gulping rate stabilization control system (RSCS). His return to the
atmosphere was "thrilling" to the astronaut. He said the sky and Earth's surface
really began to brighten, but, most surprisingly, the "bear" he rode felt "as
stable as an airplane."
<P>Schirra realized that he had heard none of the hissing noises reported by
Glenn and Carpenter. Possibly, he thought, his concentration on the rate control
system caused him to miss the sounds. Having conserved his hydrogen peroxide so
well thus far, Schirra was quite perturbed with the rate system because he could
see the fuel supply being dumped like water being flushed. Resisting the
temptation to switch to a more economical mode of control because the engineers
wanted to evaluate this system once and for all, he pulled his eyes away from
the gauge and looked out the window. He could see the green glow from air
friction that Carpenter had reported. To him it looked limeade in color, almost
chartreuse. Suddenly, as a three-foot strap flopped past the window, he
exclaimed, "My gosh!" Then he remembered, "That's the same thing John saw."
<P>Soon the barometric altimeter dial came into operation, and Schirra calmly
waited for the needle to edge toward the 40,000-foot reading. He punched the
drogue button, heard a "strong thrumming," and then felt the drogue parachute
pop open. [483] What had felt like a smooth highway now seemed like turning off
on "a bumpy road." As long as he could, the astronaut strained to watch "the
drogue up there pounding away," but the window became virtually occluded by
smoky deposits from reentry. Schirra then turned back and flipped on the fuel
jettison switch.
<P>At the 15,000-foot mark he ejected the main parachute and saw it stream and
blossom at 10,500 feet. This event, as Schirra quipped, "sort of put the cap on
the whole thing." As he started his descent to Earth, Schirra remarked to
Shepard, "I think they're gonna put me on the number 3 elevator" of the carrier
<I>Kearsarge</I>. <I>Sigma 7</I> missed this mark by a scant 4.5 miles downrange
from the planned landing point, but the recovery force had the spacecraft well
within its sights electronically and visually. The carrier made radar contact
with <I>Sigma 7</I> at a slant-range of 202 miles; 90 miles uprange from the
carrier, sailors of the destroyer <I>Renshaw</I> reported hearing a sonic boom.
Men on the deck of the <I>Kearsarge</I> then saw a contrail, while a few of its
crew claimed to see the drogue and others heard two successive sonic booms and
saw the main chute unfurl. After nine hours and 13 minutes in flight, <I>Sigma 7</I>
settled on the water, in full view of the ship's crew and the cameras of
newsmen.
<P><I>Sigma 7</I> hit the surface with a "plop," as Schirra described it, and
"went way down" before it surfaced and floated. He waited patiently for 45
seconds and then broke off the main parachute and switched on the recovery aids.
Inside, the spacecraft remained dry and the temperature range was very
comfortable as <I>Sigma 7</I> rode the lazy ocean swells. This condition
prompted the pilot to exaggerate in debriefing that he "could stay in there
forever, if necessary." Through the window he could see the green dye permeating
the water in a widening perimeter, and he knew that the whip antenna had
telescoped out fully. Seeing the antenna pole deploy while <I>Sigma 7</I> was
still submerged, Schirra later joked that he thought he might spear another
bluefish. All was well, and so far as this test pilot could judge, the Mercury
spacecraft "had gone to the top of the list," even over the F8F aircraft he
liked so well.
<P>Long before Schirra's splashdown, the <I>Kearsarge</I> had launched
helicopters with swimmer teams, and soon three swimmers jumped into the dye
beside the floating capsule. During the 30 seconds while he was keeled over in
the water, Schirra had had some trepidation about his watertight integrity. He
momentarily wished for the pressure regulator handle that had been deleted from
<I>Sigma 7</I> to save another pound of weight. As the capsule righted itself
and remained shipshape, he noticed that communications had been better with
Hawaii than they were with the <I>Kearsarge</I>. The pararescue men then cut the
whip antenna and attached the flotation collar around the heatshield. Since he
was comfortable, he radioed a request to the helicopter pilot that he "would
prefer to stay in and have a small boat come alongside" and tow him to the
carrier's cranes. Five men piled into a motor whaleboat and within minutes had
covered the half-mile to the bobbing <I>Sigma 7</I> and attached a tow line to
it.
<P>[484] Some nine hours and 54 minutes after launch, the small space ship was
hoisted aboard the huge carrier. Five minutes later Schirra whacked the plunger
to blow the explosive hatch, incurring the same kind of superficial hand injury
as Glenn before him. He stepped out onto the deck of the <I>Kearsarge</I> and
paused to acknowledge the jubilant shouts and applause of the ship's crew. As he
walked down to the ship's sick bay, Schirra looked tired and hot but happy. When
reporters called out, "How do you feel, Wally?" he replied, "Fine," with a flip
of the hand.
<P>For the next three days, the <I>Kearsarge</I> was to be his home during the
medical examinations and technical debriefings. While still in his space suit
and sitting on a cot in the officers' sickroom, he received successive
congratulatory telephone calls from President Kennedy, his wife Josephine
Schirra, and Vice President Johnson.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
<P>Richard A. Pollard of MSC, Commander Max Trummer of the Navy, and several
other physicians began to check Schirra in every medical way possible. When his
phone calls were completed, about 45 minutes after he came on board, the
systematic examinations began. At first appearance, the spaceman showed no
evidence that he was dizzy or required walking assistance. He told the
physicians, "I feel fine. It was a textbook flight. The flight went just the way
I wanted it to." Contrary to the impression of some newsmen, the physicians did
not find Schirra overly fatigued. He talked easily and actively assisted in his
postflight physical. Only after he had been strapped on a tilt table did several
unusual symptoms begin to appear. For example, when lying supine his heartbeat
averaged 70 a minute; standing, it rose to 100. Blood pressure readings,
although not so pronounced in range, registered differently in standing,
sitting, and prone positions. His legs and feet assumed a dusky, reddish-purple
color when Schirra stood up, connoting that his veins were engorged. This
condition persisted for about six hours, and then the astronaut was permitted to
retire for the night. The next morning Schirra's heart and blood pressure
readings were near normal, and there was no evidence of pooling of blood in his
legs when he stood.
<P>Other than this minor anomaly, and the small lesion on his hand, Schirra
seemed none the worse for his lengthy weightless sojourn in space. Life-systems
specialists in NASA, at McDonnell, and at AiResearch, however, had another
question: What caused the elevated suit temperatures during the first two
orbits? Postflight inspectors dug into the matter promptly. The technical ills
of the spacecraft's systems were more easily determined than the subtleties of
man's physiological system; as it turned out, the flow in the suit coolant
circuit had been impeded by the silicone lubricant on a needle valve's having
dried out and flaked.
<P>Postflight inspection of <I>Sigma 7</I> found little else that seemed out of
the ordinary. Circular cracks on the ablation shield were moderately larger than
on Glenn's and Carpenter's spacecraft; also it appeared that the shield had
banged into the fiber-glass protective bulkhead upon impact, causing several
small holes. Once again the heatshield showed some delamination from the center,
but it still [486] appeared, as in past flights, that this occurred after
reentry. Char depth on the shield, about a third of an inch, was quite nominal.
The shield's center plug, which had been loose or missing after previous
missions, stayed tightly in place. All in all, the inspectors found very few
problems to analyze or to correct. The quality of the mission, of the hardware,
of the software, of procedures, and of the pilot were all superb. In terminology
the engineers agreed with Schirra that MA-8 was a "text book flight" - the best
so far.

<P>Walter Williams was especially jubilant over the MA-8 success; now he could
confidently turn his operations team to the task of the day-long mission.
Schirra's conservation of fuel and the excellent manner in which the spacecraft
had performed, he said, made planning for MA-9, if not routine, at least
considerably easier.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>Upon leaving the <I>Kearsarge</I>, Schirra received the leis of Hawaii and a
tumultuous aloha. Then he flew back to Houston. In a press conference at Rice
University, he reported about his spatial voyage to an American public that now
was more conversant with the terminology of space technology. Thereafter, the
hamlet of Oradell, New Jersey, greeted its most famous son, and from there
Schirra went to Washington to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from
the President and, from the Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy's anchored
version of the coveted astronaut's wings. Throughout the national hurrahs,
however, the thoughts and words of participants in Project Mercury turned toward
the advent of the day-long mission, another step toward reaching the lunar
landing goal in the decade of the sixties.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
<P>In mid-October 1962 the frightening Cuban missile crisis raised the spectre
of nuclear holocaust. This dampened some of the postflight celebrations for
Schirra. When President Kennedy appeared on nationwide television to explain his
actions in blockading Cuba to force the Soviets to withdraw their ballistic
missiles from Fidel Castro's island, Americans perhaps for the first time became
acutely aware of the differences between medium-range (200-500-mile) "defensive"
missiles and intermediate-range (1000-1500-mile) "offensive" rocket weapons.
Neither the ICBM deterrent (defined as having an operational range of about
6000 miles) nor the success of Kennedy's confrontation of Khrushchev over
Soviet IRBMs in Cuba could entirely relax the tension built up by this crisis.
But it probably did more than any manned space flight had to educate the public
on relative thrust capacities of rockets.

<H3>Redevelopment for MA-9</H3>The flight of <I>Sigma 7</I> had been so nearly
idyllic that some observers, whether from cynicism or a kind of parental
possessiveness, believed Project Mercury should be concluded on Schirra's
positive note. Any further attempt at manned satellite flight with this
first-generation hardware might press the program's luck too far and end sourly,
if not calamitously. To cancel Mercury now would ensure the reputation of the
project. Others argued it would sacrifice the living potential, [487] as well as
the intense desire, of the Mercury team to test man in space for one full day.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
<P>Among Manned Spacecraft Center officials, there was no real decision to be
made here; Mercury had begun in earnest in 1959 with a vision of an ultimate
18-orbit mission. But by October 1959, the inexorable growth in capsule weight
and power requirements and the limitations of the network had forced the Space
Task Group to erase that vision. The 18-orbit mission for Mercury had been
revived by the summer of 1961, in conjunction with serious planning for Project
Apollo and for a "Mark II" ballistic capsule design. And when Project Gemini was
publicly named on January 3, 1962, as an interim program to fill the void before
Apollo could be developed, Mercury engineers were already diving headlong toward
the revived 18-orbit, 27-hour mission.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>During the period from September 1961 to January 1962, the word "capsule" had
been erased from Mercury vocabulary in favor of the word "spacecraft." It was
then that the Space Task Group (STG) became Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC), and
NASA Headquarters reorganized Abe Silverstein's Office of Space Flight Programs
into an Office of Manned Space Flight under a new director, D. Brainerd Holmes.
In the midst of all this confusion, one thing had been clear: a Mercury
spacecraft would have to fill the gaps in space, time, and knowledge before a
Project Gemini two-man capsule could be developed and qualified. Although the
physiological effects of extended exposure to weightlessness were still of
primary interest, the only local policy issue was whether to adopt another
change in nomenclature. Should the day-long sustained space flight be called
MA-9 or Manned One-Day Mission (MODM)?<A
href="notes.htm#n14.35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>Throughout the spring and summer of 1962, Mercury engineers, both at NASA
centers and in St. Louis, had studied various design proposals for advanced
versions of the ballistic spacecraft. The first Gemini capsule mockup review had
been held at the factory on March 29, about the same time that Lewis R. Fisher,
James E. Bost, William M. Bland, Jr., Robert T. Everline, and others had
completed the specifications for a Mercury spacecraft for the manned one-day
flight. Not until September, however, were negotiations settled with McDonnell
over configuration changes to the four capsules set aside for this purpose (Nos.
12, 15, 17, and 20). A week before the Schirra flight, NASA Headquarters
announced a new plan to phase Mercury into Gemini more quickly, if MA-8 and MA-9
met all expectations.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>After Schirra, Atlas 113-D, and <I>Sigma 7</I> excelled those expectations in
nearly every respect, the Manned Spacecraft Center forwarded its sixteenth
quarterly status report to NASA Headquarters, claiming:
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report will be the final in the series of Project MERCURY, as
  such, since the MA-8 flight was the last mission of Project MERCURY. Future
  reports, although they will continue with the following number (17), will be
  on the status of the Manned One-Day Mission (MODM) Project (MERCURY
  Spacecraft).</BLOCKQUOTE>

</DIV>

<P>[489] Robert Gilruth's team, now located in temporary
quarters at 13 buildings scattered over southeast Houston, was planning on an
April 1963 launch date for MA-9, using spacecraft No. 20. On November 9, 1962,
MSC's senior staff decided to aim for 22 rather than 18 orbits (or 34 rather
than 27 hours), if all went normally.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
<P>Walter Williams, Christopher Kraft, and Kenneth Kleinknecht proceeded to
coordinate the mission planning with the Defense Department. This flight would
involve vastly expanded support, because MA-9 was to criss-cross virtually all
of Earth's surface between latitudes 33 degrees north and south of the equator.
L. Gordon Cooper was officially announced as the pilot and Alan Shepard was
named alternate in mid-November. McDonnell had estimated that this mission alone
would cost $17,879,834 to complete, but as yet the Air Force, Navy, and Army
participants had not conferred with NASA about new needs for the recovery
network and medical support.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
Clearly the MA-9 operation would not be able to challenge the 64-orbit feat of
Nikolayev in <I>Vostok III</I> nor the 48 orbits of Popovich in the tandem
<I>Vostok IV</I>, but MA-9 should go well beyond Titov's 17 orbits in <I>Vostok
II</I>.
<P>Meanwhile NASA and the Manned Spacecraft Center took their cues from
President Kennedy and Administrator James E. Webb to mobilize greater effort
toward the longer-range goals symbolized by Project Apollo. Only 55 persons
staffed Kleinknecht's Mercury Project Office specifically to coordinate the
diverse preparations for MA-9. Of the 2500 people employed by MSC in January
1963, only 500 were working directly on Mercury. The Gemini and Apollo teams
were rapidly taking shape. NASA had just honored a group of nine old-time
engineers from the Space Task Group as the "Mercury Spacecraft Inventors." The
list of innovators was headed by Maxime A. Faget, and included Andre J. Meyer,
Jr., William Bland, Alan B. Kehlet, Willard S. Blanchard, Robert G. Chilton,
Jerome B. Hammack, Caldwell C. Johnson, and Jack C. Heberlig. But of that group
of designers and developers, only Bland still remained employed in the Mercury
Project Office. The rest had gone to work on Gemini and Apollo.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>One of the more significant New Year's resolutions enacted by NASA in 1963
was the appointment of a Manned Space Science Planning Group and of a Panel on
Inflight Scientific Experiments, known informally as POISE, chaired respectively
by Eugene M. Shoemaker and John A. O'Keefe. These two new groups were
established to replace the Ad Hoc Committee on Scientific Tasks and Training for
Man-in-Space and to ensure closer coordination between the Manned Spacecraft
Center and the NASA Office of Space Sciences. They were only temporary
expedients, staffed by most of the same people who had served earlier as
consultants, but at least the manned space science programs for Gemini would be
born more respectably than those for Mercury.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>At the first MSC senior staff meeting in 1963, Walter Williams warned his
colleagues that two recent failures in Atlas-F launchings by the Air Force were
inexplicable, or so far, at least, unexplained. Unless investigating committees
[490] could clear up these failures soon, absolving the Atlas-D from any guilt
by association, the MA-9 schedule might suffer. After five years of
developmental experience, the Atlas ICBM had approached but still not attained a
reliability high enough for comfort. The Atlas, even as modified and
"gold-plated" by the "man-rating" tests and procedures, was still basically a
ballistic missile, only converted and not designed to launch men into space.
After five consecutive Mercury-Atlas launches without a failure, it was all too
easy to forget this fact.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
When the 130-D, Cooper's "bird," was first rolled out of the factory in San
Diego on January 30, it failed to pass inspection and was returned for some
rewiring.
<P>Amid some charges from impatient newsmen that NASA had "muzzled" Cooper, the
prime pilot took time out on February 8 to hold a press conference in Houston
that refuted such public speculation. Cooper forthrightly admitted what little
he knew about the booster problem and answered in picturesque detail a host of
questions about new developments for his space suit, his spacecraft, his
mission. "This is going to practically be a flying camera," he said, explaining
the new slow-scan television monitor, the 70-millimeter Hasselblad and its
different film packs, the special zodiacal-light 35-millimeter camera, and a
16-millimeter, all-purpose moving-picture camera. Cooper had difficulty
convincing some reporters that the duration of the MA-9 mission would depend on
how well it went - for "as many as 22 orbits" - and that he was still
"struggling" to find a suitable name for spacecraft No. 20. But otherwise he
talked freely about the most significant differences between the MA-8 and MA-9
spacecraft, although obviously he could not name all 183 of the changes then
underway at McDonnell's Canaveral shop.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
<P>Weight growth had been the primary nemesis in preparing for every Mercury
mission, and this was especially true for the day-long mission. As is
characteristic perhaps of all American technology, and especially of advanced
modifications to military aircraft, overweight accessories tended to compromise
the vehicles' performance. In the case of the MODM spacecraft, heavier batteries
for more electrical power, another 4-pound bottle of oxygen, 9 pounds of cooling
and 4.5 pounds of drinking water, plus 15 more pounds of peroxide fuel were
imperative additions. Experimental gear, a full load of consumables for life
support systems, and various modified components were also judged necessary,
though heavier, installations. In an effort to compensate for these added
weights, the 12-pound Rate Stabilization Control System (RSCS), a 3-pound UHF
and a 2-pound telemetry transmitter, both of which were true redundancies now;
and, in particular, the 76-pound periscope were deleted. Manned Spacecraft
Center engineers almost discarded the fiber-glass couch in favor of a new
hammock to shave away 17 more pounds, but that change did not materialize
because the engineers feared the material might stretch and the astronaut
bounce. So the MA-9 payload continued, through 31 weeks of grooming, to grow
into an estimated weight of 3026.3 pounds in orbit.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>Such weight increases had become expected, at the rate of about two pounds
per week of preparation, and early in 1962 the Mercury managers had called for
[491] an extensive requalification program of the parachute and landing system.
Known as Project Reef, these tests had effectively allayed all fears about the
ring-sail parachutes' margin for error with heavier loads long before <I>Sigma
7</I> gave an even better demonstration. At the beginning of 1963, NASA
scientists from other centers were pleased to gain some voting strength on the
20-man committee established nine months earlier to decide what in-flight
scientific experiments should be conducted. But the majority voting strength of
this panel still remained with MSC engineers, whose weight-consciousness and
power-consciousness effectively stifled the transformation of MA-9 and
spacecraft No. 20 into a more purely scientific orbital laboratory.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
<P>Another ground test program behind the scenes, namely Project Orbit, which by
the end of February 1963 had completed a 100-hour full-scale simulated mission
in its thermo-cryogenic vacuum chamber, stirred up concern that the reaction
control thrusters might get sluggish or freeze during long periods of inactivity
in space. In all other respects, Project Orbit seemed to certify that the
McDonnell spacecraft and all subcontracted systems were ready and reliable for a
full day or more up there.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile, the tiger teams at work on Atlas 130-D were exceptionally pleased
when, on March 15, 1963, the second factory rollout and flight-acceptance
inspections on this booster were completed without a single minor discrepancy.
Philip E. Culbertson, Gus Groissant, John P. Hopman, and David R. Archibald of
General Dynamics/Astronautics flew across the country to deliver to their test
conductor at the Cape, Calvin D. Fowler, what they believed to be their best
bird yet. Bernhard A. Hohmann and helpers at Aerospace Corporation had defined
an offset of the booster engines to counteract the threatening roll rate that
Schirra had experienced at liftoff. And on April 22 spacecraft and rocket were
mated.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>By the end of April, all plans and preparations had been well laid and
revised in accord with the precedents and lessons of previous flights. The
detailed flight plan, technical information summaries, calculated preflight
trajectory data, public information directives, experiments guidebook, and
documentation directives were all disseminated. The world was girdled by
military and medical recovery personnel waiting for May 14 and the launch of
Gordon Cooper. A total of 28 ships, 171 aircraft, and about 18,000 servicemen
were assigned to support MA-9. These included 84 medical specialists, a
reduction by half in the number of medical monitors and corpsmen since Glenn's
flight. This was a token of the confidence the planners now had in Mercury and
its men.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>But that confidence was not shared by everyone. While Cooper struggled to
select the most appropriate name for his capsule, criticism of NASA and its
implementation of national space goals swelled once again. Philip H. Abelson,
editor of <I>Science</I>, the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science; Warren Weaver of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation; and
Senator J. William Fulbright from Arkansas raised voices in protest against the
Moon race and against manned space flight in general. The costs of manned
orbital flight, [492] the confusion regarding "science" and "technology," and
urgent social and political problems deserving equal attention were to be widely
debated.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>Against this context, when Cooper finally announced his choice of a call-sign
- <I>Faith 7</I>, symbolizing "my trust in God, my country, and my teammates" -
NASA public affairs officers were described by the <I>Washington Post</I> as
worried:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The naming of the bell-shaped capsule - a tradition accorded to
  the astronaut riding it - has given Cooper some bad moments. He has picked
  <I>"Faith 7,"</I> which has drawn some raised eyebrows in the "image" conscious space
  agency.
  <P>"Suppose that, for some reason, we lost the capsule at sea," said one
  source. "Then it would come out reading something like, 'The United States
  today lost Faith. . . .'"<A
  href="notes.htm#n14.49"><SUP>49</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>So
much had happened, so many things had changed in the four years since Project
Mercury had become publicized by the selection of its seven astronauts, that the
Manned One-Day Mission seemed an appropriate new name to symbolize the
differences. Now there was a second class of nine more astronauts-in-training;
there was the national goal of a lunar landing before 1970; there were new
facilities, new administrators, and thoroughly reorganized procedures and
policies to follow. <I>Mariner II</I>, in its magnificent survey of Venus in
December 1962, was interpreted a few months later as having proved Venus to be
one destination in planetary space that might as well be forgotten as a target
for manned landings. Mars remained a mystery, and so also did Earth's Moon, for
that matter, but the decision to try Project Apollo made Mercury already merely
a demigod. While Project Ozma used radio telescopes in a search for evidence of
intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, <I>Telstar II</I> was launched May
7, 1963, to renew the hope that Earthmen might exercise greater intelligence
than they had in the past by establishing more intelligent communications with
each other.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
<P>In the midst of the heat of scientific and political criticism of both
Department of Defense and NASA space priorities and costs, NASA and the Mercury
managers had to decide what, if anything, should be the next mission after MA-9.
If Walter Williams and others at MSC had their way, an MA-10 mission, planned
for a three-day sojourn in space, would follow. But they were overruled, and
Julian Scheer, the new NASA Deputy Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs,
announced emphatically on May 11, "It is absolutely beyond question that if this
shot is successful there will be no MA-10."<A
href="notes.htm#n14.51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>So Astronaut Cooper knew, as he made the final preparations after four years
of training, that his flight would mark the end of the beginning. A well-known
life insurance company subscribed to Cooper's faith by underwriting the first
commercial astronaut policies, including one for Cooper. The Mercury operations
team gathered at the Cape the second week in May and found <I>Faith 7</I>, Atlas
130-D, and Cooper all ready to take off. Only the weatherman, Ernest A. Amman,
voiced his doubts about the May 14 launch date.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>At 6:36 on the morning of May 14, Gordon Cooper was sealed inside his
<I>Faith 7</I> spacecraft atop the steeple that was his Atlas. He checked off
all his systems [493] and awaited completion of the blockhouse and Control
Center checkoffs, which should count down to ignition about 9 o'clock and lift
him up to insertion about 9:05. A suction-cup force pump, the kind commonly
called a "plumber's friend," had been Alan Shepard's parting gift to Cooper, but
the instruction inscribed on the handle, "Remove before launch," had been
obeyed. It would not make the long trip with Cooper.
<P>While waiting, Cooper heard the secondary control center on Bermuda report
that its basic C-band radar system was misbehaving both in azimuth and range. So
he napped for a time during repairs. When Bermuda had corrected the difficulty,
at about 8 o'clock, the countdown was resumed, and the gantry was ordered back.
But the diesel engine failed to move the gantry, and engineers scurried around,
looking for the proper plumber's helper to repair a fouled fuel injection pump.
[494] More than two exasperating hours were lost on the "fail-safe" diesel
locomotive before the count could resume.
<P>At high noon, the gantry was driven back. But radar data from Bermuda, which
was vital to the go/no go decision before the point of no return, now was
intermittent. The launch was postponed. Cooper emerged from his capsule, saying,
"I was just getting to the real fun part. . . . It was a very real simulation."
Later that afternoon he went fishing, while checkout crews stayed at the pad,
seeking out unsuspected trouble spots such as the diesel fuel pump.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>That night Mercury Operations Director Williams broadcast the word: "All
systems are go, and the weather is good. Let's pick up the count and go." Cooper
lay down to sleep, confident that his safety and the mission would keep until he
should awake and take his place.
<P>Next morning the countdown proceeded smoothly. Cooper had lain in the capsule
only two and a half hours when he heard the final chant:
<P>"T minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Ignition. Liftoff."<A

<P class="caption">The worldwide interest and sense of identification with
Project Mercury was always apparent. From Glenn's flight on, one country that

<H3><I>Faith 7</I> for 22 Orbits</H3>Thirteen seconds past 8:04, range-zero
time, on the morning of May 15, 1963, Mercury-Atlas 9 lumbered upward the two
inches that defined liftoff and thundered on toward its keyhole in the sky.
Inside MA-9, Astronaut Gordon Cooper felt the smooth but definite push intensify
as <I>Faith 7</I> gained altitude faster each second. His clocks marking the
moments in synchronization, Cooper shouted through the din of the afterburner
behind him to Walter Schirra, his predecessor and now capsule communicator at
the Cape, "Feels good, buddy. . . . All systems go."<A
href="notes.htm#n14.55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
<P>Sixty seconds upward, MA-9 initiated its pitch program, and Cooper felt the
max-q vibrations grow, but the rate gyros sensed greater lateral oscillations
than the pilot did. Six or seven swings from peg to peg on his instruments, and
the flight smoothed out. Two minutes and 14 seconds upward Cooper heard "a loud
'glung' and then a sharp, crisp 'thud' for staging" as booster engines cut
themselves out and off. Then away flew the needless escape tower, and at three
minutes after launch cabin pressure sealed and held while Cooper reported,
"<I>Faith Seven</I> is all go."
<P>The Atlas sustainer engine continued to accelerate, and its guidance system
performed perfectly for two more minutes before SECO. <I>Faith 7</I> and
"<I>Sigma 7</I>" swapped remarks on the sweetness of the trajectory. Schirra, at
the point of Cooper's orbital insertion and capsule separation, said, "Smack dab
in the middle of the go plot. Beautiful." And Cooper replied, after turning
around on the fly-by-wire, "Boy, oh, boy . . . working just like advertised!"
<P>In full horizontal flight over Bermuda at 17,547 miles per hour, Cooper
watched his booster lag and tumble for about eight minutes, then checked his
temperatures and contingency recovery areas, and tried to adjust to the strange
[495] new sensations and perspectives at a little more than 100 miles (near his
perigee) above sea level. Floating higher in his couch, now that he was
weightless, Cooper agreed with Carpenter's report that an astronaut's sense of
the cockpit changes when he reaches zero g and no longer feels himself lying
flat on his back. Status checks with the Canary Islands and Kano, Nigeria, came
on so fast that Cooper could hardly believe he had crossed the Atlantic Ocean
and half of Africa already.
<P>Over Zanzibar, he learned that his orbital parameters looked good enough for
at least 20 revolutions and that all <I>Faith 7</I>'s telemetry was working
well. His suit temperature fluctuated somewhat erratically, but as he watched
his first sunset from space over the Indian Ocean he forgot his discomfort while
looking at the airglow, spotting the twinkleless stars, and observing sheet
lightning in scattered thunderstorms "down under." He saw the lights of Perth,
Australia, on schedule 55 minutes after liftoff, and over Canton Island, in the
Polynesian Archipelago, just south of the equator, the Sun began to rise behind
him (as he flew backward toward the sunrise), and Cooper reported observing
Glenn's "fireflies," or Carpenter's "frostflies," drifting along with the
spacecraft at five miles per second.
<P>From Guaymas, Mexico, Grissom, acting as capsule communicator, officially
relayed the computer-blessed "go for seven orbits." Cooper, audibly impressed
with the perfection of the flight so far, said, "It's great. . . . quite a full
night. . . . everything appears very nominal on board here." As Cooper passed
over the launch site at Cape Canaveral, Schirra raised him on the radio circuits
once again and complained, "You son-of-a-gun, I haven't got anything to talk
about. . . . I'm still higher and faster, but I have an idea you're going to go
farther." The manned one-day mission was off to an auspicious start. Alan
Shepard, who had been Cooper's backup pilot and was now also talking to <I>Faith
7</I> from Mercury Control, coached Cooper into his second orbit, saying, "All
of our monitors down here are overjoyed. Everything looks beautiful."
<P>Cooper thought so, too. All his spacecraft and physiological systems
performed perfectly on his first two orbits. His only complaint concerned an
oily film on his "windshield" that seemed to be on the outside pane of the
window. Between Zanzibar and Muchea on his second pass, Cooper dozed off for a
four-minute nap and then drifted across the Pacific, observing storms while
inverted and stars when facing spaceward.
<P>Beginning with his third orbit, the astronaut checked over the 11 experiments
in which he was to participate. He prepared to eject a six-inch-diameter sphere,
equipped with polar xenon strobe lights, that was to test his ability to spot
and track a flashing beacon in a tangential orbit. At three hours and 25 minutes
elapsed time, Cooper clicked the squib switch and heard and felt the beacon kick
away. But, try as he might, he could not see the flashing light in the dusk or
on the nightside during this round. On the fourth orbit, however, he did spot
the beacon at sunset and later saw it pulsing. So he knew he had indeed launched
a satellite from his satellite. Cooper jubilantly reported to Carpenter on
Kauai, "I was with the little rascal all night."
<P>[496] Subsequently, on his fifth and sixth orbits, Cooper saw the flashing
xenon several more times, and likewise spotted the constant xenon ground light
of 44,000 watts placed at Bloemfontein, a little horseshoe-shaped town in the
Union of South Africa. Having eaten some bite-sized brownie and fruitcake foods
and excreted periodic samples for urinalysis, Cooper also kept up with his
calibrated exercises, took oral temperatures and blood pressure readings, and
did other duties required for the highest priority experiments of the MA-9
mission, the aeromedical ones.
<P>Also on his sixth orbit, after nine hours in space, the astronaut set his
cameras, attitude, and switches to deploy a tethered balloon, similar to the one
tried on MA-7, for aerodynamic studies of drag and for more visual experiments.
The balloon, a 30-inch-diameter Mylar sphere painted fluorescent orange, was to
be inflated with nitrogen and attached by a 100-foot nylon line to the
spacecraft antenna canister; a strain gauge in the canister should be able to
measure the differences in pull on the balloon at apogee (166 miles) and perigee
(100 miles). Cooper carefully went through his checklist, then tried to eject the
balloon package, but nothing happened. He tried again, and still nothing
happened. Because the antenna canister was later lost, no one ever knew why the
tethered balloon failed to eject. But the second failure of this experiment was
more severely disappointing than the first.
<P>When Cooper surpassed Schirra's record by moving into a seventh orbital pass,
he was engaged with the radiation experiments and with the hydraulic work of
transferring urine samples and condensate water from tank to tank. During the
automatically recorded radiation measurements, he had to turn the recorders on
and off precisely on time and estimate accurately, without benefit of gyros, his
drifting spacecraft's attitude. The hydraulic work was more difficult, because
the hypodermic-type syringes used to pump the liquid manually from one bag
container to another were unwieldy and exasperatingly leaky. At 9:27 elapsed
time, Cooper spoke into his tape recorder, "The thing about this pumping under
zero g is not good. [Liquid] tends to stand in the pipes, and you have to
actually forcibly force it through."
<P>After 10 hours of the mission, Zanzibar officially informed Cooper that he
had a go for 17 orbital passes. The tracking, communication, and computing
facilities at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland had long since settled
down to a routine in following <I>Faith 7</I> around the world. The actual
orbital parameters for Cooper's flight were proving so close to those planned
that the differences were measurable only in tenths of a mile and hundredths of
a degree. MA-9 was circumnavigating Earth once every 88 minutes and 45 seconds
at an inclination angle of 32.55 degrees to the equator. Soon, as Earth turned
beneath Cooper, his orbital track would have shifted too much to keep him within
range of most of the scattered tracking and communications sites in Mercury's
worldwide network. Then, too, the word "orbit" would become confused, because
passing [497] over the same meridian on the rotating planet is not the same as
passing through the space-fixed point of orbital insertion.
<P>Cooper spent his last "orbit" before his scheduled rest period, on orbits 9
through 13, in extensive activity. He finished the radiation measurements; he
ate his supper of powdered roast beef mush and gulped some water; he took
pictures over India and Tibet; and he checked all his machinery for readiness to
power down and drift and dream for the next seven hours or so. Passing from the
Himalayas to Japan in less than five minutes, Cooper was aroused by John Glenn's
second transmission from the tracking ship <I>Coastal Sentry</I>, located near
Kyushu. Veteran spaceman Glenn assured Astronaut Cooper, "You're sure looking
good. Everything couldn't be finer on this pass." Ten minutes later Cooper had
traversed the Pacific lengthwise in a southeasterly direction and had come over
the telemetry command ship <I>Rose Knot</I>, positioned near Pitcairn Island, at
latitude 25 degrees south and 120 degrees west. There he gave a full report on
all systems; the shipborne communicator advised him to "settle down for a long
rest."
<P>But Cooper was still too excited and fascinated to feel sleepy. Orbit 9 was
to carry him again around South America, over Africa, northern India, and Tibet
during daylight, and he resolved to record on film some of the remarkable things
he could see while looking down at open terrain. On this circuit Cooper snapped
most of his best photographs, demonstrating his contention that he could see
roads, rivers, small villages, and even individual houses if the lighting and
background conditions were right. High over the highest plateau on Earth, the
Tibetan highlands, where the air is thin and visibility is seldom obscured by
haze, Cooper thought he could even judge speed and direction of ground winds by
the smoke from the house chimneys.
<P>In their third radio contact, John Glenn, as "Coastal Sentry Quebec," advised
Cooper, who had now been in space over 13 hours, 34 minutes, that he should
"tell everyone to go away and leave you alone now." Cooper then relaxed and fell
into a sound sleep. He awoke drowsily an hour later when his suit temperature
got too high. Intermittently, for the next six hours, during orbital passes 10
through 13, Cooper napped, took more pictures, taped status reports
occasionally, and cursed to himself over the bothersome body-heat exchanger that
kept creeping away toward freezing or burning temperatures. At the end of his
rest period, Cooper taped his surprise at having napped so soundly that neither
floating arms nor weightless dreams had startled him into awareness of where he
was when he woke. But he cautioned psychologists not to make too much of this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Have a note to be added in for head-shrinkers. Enjoy the full
  drifting flights most of all, where you have really the feeling of freedom,
  and you aren't worried about the systems fouling up. You have everything
  turned off, and just drifting along lazily. However, I haven't encountered any
  of this so-called split-off phenomena. Still note that I am thinking very much
  about returning to Earth at the proper time and safely.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>[499] Coming
around Muchea again, on his fourteenth pass, Cooper checked over all his
systems, found his oxygen supply plentiful, and reported his peroxide fuel for
attitude control showing 69 percent remaining in the automatic tank and 95
percent in the manual. He was in good shape, and all systems were still working
"as advertised." At this point, Gordon Cooper spoke a prayer into his tape
recorder aboard <I>Faith 7</I>, high in the heavens over the South Pacific. The
MA-9 mission was well beyond its midpoint in time and space, and Cooper was
humbly grateful that everything was still nominal. Physiologically his vision he
knew was abnormally good. Philosophically the vision of this eighth man in
history to orbit Earth in a manned satellite was bound to his culture, his
times, and his origins in Oklahoma.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
<P>Orbit 15 was consumed largely in calibration of equipment and synchronization
of clocks, since by now Earthmen had experienced one more full 24-hour day of
grace, whereas <I>Faith 7</I>'s elapsed time was faster by some 16 seconds than
range-zero elapsed time. Orbit 16 brought Cooper back over Cape Canaveral and
onward, virtually retracing his first shadow over Earth. The President of El
Salvador had radioed greetings on pass 15, and on 16 Cooper sent a similar
political greeting to African leaders meeting in Ethiopia. Then he buckled down
immediately to another high-priority experiment requiring elaborate timing
precautions.
<P>As he entered Earth's shadow, or nightside, on this sixteenth orbit, Cooper
caged and freed his gyros in such a manner as to allow his automatic attitude
control system to torque the spacecraft slowly in pitch through the plane of the
ecliptic. He could view, through his window, the mysterious phenomena of
zodiacal light and night airglow layer. Together these two different objectives
were called "dim light" phenomena, and the experimental photographs were
designed to answer astrophysical questions about the origin, continuity,
intensity, and reflectivity of visible electromagnetic spectra along the basic
reference plane of the celestial sphere. They might also help answer some
questions about solar energy conversion in the upper atmosphere. From Zanzibar,
past the Canton Island station, Cooper called out the count as he clicked the
series of astronomical photographs. Although the zodiacal light pictures turned
out underexposed and the airglow shots overexposed, they were of usable quality
and supplemented Carpenter's pictures from <I>Aurora 7</I> nicely.
<P>Over Mexico, Cooper shifted to the next most important photographic task,
that of snapping horizon-definition imprints in each quadrant around his local
vertical position. Just as University of Minnesota scientists had prepared him
for the zodiacal light task, so Massachusetts Institute of Technology
researchers had arranged for these snapshots to aid in the design of a guidance
and navigation system for Project Apollo. Cooper's horizon-definition pictures
marked a significant advance beyond those from the MA-7 mission. In contact with
the Cape once again, Cooper lightheartedly complained like a typical American
tourist, "Man, all I do is take pictures, pictures, pictures!"
<P>[500] But he was not through yet. On orbits 17 and 18 he took infrared
weather photographs of good quality and a few excellent moonset Earth-limb
pictures. Meanwhile, he resumed the geiger counter measurements for radiation,
continued his aeromedical duties, and adjusted his television monitor at the
request of ground observers. The eighteenth pass over the United States, like
the sixteenth, gave his extraordinary vistas of his country from southern
California, across Dallas the first time and Houston the second, to the Florida
peninsula. He sang during orbits 18 and 19, still surprised with every pass,
still marveling at the greenery on Earth and on his instrument panel as he came
toward his thirtieth hour in space.
<P>Although "this fine plumbing they put in this thing" proved more troublesome
later, Cooper had learned to adjust his suit temperatures for comfort and to eat
and drink over the rim of his helmet fairly effectively, if awkwardly. Then on
his nineteenth orbit, while checking his warning lights before a high-frequency
antenna test over Hawaii, Cooper noticed the first potentially serious systems
anomaly of his mission.
<P>A small telelight lit up green, indicating that <I>Faith 7</I> was
decelerating and that the centripetal force of gravity had overcome by .05 g the
centrifugal force of the spacecraft's orbital moment of inertia. This had to be
a false indication, reasoned Cooper, because he felt, and his loose gear still
appeared, weightless. But were g forces building up imperceptibly? California
confirmed no such indication. Mercury Control showed great concern over the
implications of this little light for the attitude stabilization at retrofire.
The fears of the flight controllers were realized on the next pass, when Cooper
lost all attitude readings. Then, on the twenty-first orbit, a short-circuit
occurred in a busbar serving the 250-volt main inverter, leaving the automatic
stabilization and control system without electric power. The minor glitch had
become a serious hitch.
<P>Mercury Control Center was in a flurry of worried activity, cross-checking
<I>Faith 7</I>'s problems and Cooper's diagnostic actions with identical
equipment at the Cape and in St. Louis, then relaying to each communications
site questions to ask and instructions to give. Cooper remained cool, if not
calm, now that his alertness had been stimulated by a medically prescribed pill
of dextroamphetamine.
<P>On the twenty-first pass (over the tracking ship <I>Coastal Sentry</I>), John
Glenn helped Cooper prepare a revised checklist for retrofire procedure during
the next, and last, time around. Only Hawaii and Zanzibar were within voice
radio range on this last circuit, but communications were good. When the ASCS
inverter blew out, Cooper also noted that the carbon dioxide level was rising in
both his suit and cabin. "Things are beginning to stack up a little" was his
classic understatement to Carpenter, and then Zanzibar heard him say he would
make a manual reentry.
<P>Twenty-three minutes later Cooper came into contact with Glenn again,
reporting himself in retroattitude, holding manually, and with checkoff list
complete. Glenn gave the 10-second countdown, and Cooper, keeping his pitch down
34 degrees by his window reticle, shot his retrorockets manually on the "Mark!"
Glenn reported: "Right on the old gazoo. . . . Dealer's choice on reentry here,
[501] fly-by-wire or manual . . . It's been a real fine flight, Gordo. Real
beautiful all the way. Have a cool reentry, will you."
<P>"Roger, John. Thank you."
<P>And that he did. All the complicated, crowded events of the next 15 minutes
occurred precisely as planned, while <I>Faith 7</I> plummeted down through the
atmosphere. Four miles ahead of the prime recovery ship, again the carrier
<I>Kearsarge</I>, just south of Midway Island, the canopied capsule containing
Gordon Cooper broke through a mild overcast and landed on the lazy waves of the
blue Pacific.
<P>Splashdown came 34 hours and 20 minutes after liftoff. Cooper professed
disappointment that he too had "missed that third elevator" aboard "Begonia,"
meaning the <I>Kearsarge</I>. The spacecraft floundered in the water for a
moment, then righted itself, as hovering helicopters dropped their swimmers and
relayed Cooper's request as an Air Force officer for permission to be hoisted
aboard the Navy's carrier. Permission was granted, and 40 hot, humid minutes
later the explosive hatch blew open at the command of MSC engineer John B.
Graham, Jr. Physicians examined Cooper for eight more minutes while he lay in
the couch. Then they helped him emerge and steadied him during a moment of
dizziness until he regained his equilibrium. Away in triumph marched the one-man
crew of the one-day Mercury mission.<A
href="notes.htm#n14.57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
<P>Like Schirra, Cooper went through arduous medical, technical, and operational
debriefings aboard the <I>Kearsarge</I> and later back at the Manned Spacecraft
Center. He, too, was found to be dehydrated and suffering from a slight case of
orthostatic hypotension. He had lost seven pounds since suiting up, but after
drinking "a few gallons of liquid," he was fine, ebullient both mentally and
physically, and convinced that "we certainly can elongate this mission." Robert
C. Seamans, Jr., Associate Administrator of NASA, and Robert Gilruth, Director
of MSC, had different ideas about MA-10, but Cooper reiterated the proof that
"man is a pretty good backup system to all these automatic systems, and I think
the mission was conducted just like it was planned . . . in spite of . . . equipment
breaking down."<A
href="notes.htm#n14.58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
<P>In addition to undergoing technical debriefings over the next several days,
Cooper was honored by parades through Honolulu, Cocoa Beach, Washington - where
he addressed a joint session of Congress - and New York City, where he was
hailed by one of the largest tickertaped crowds ever to greet an individual.
Other crowds in Houston and in his hometown of Shawnee, Oklahoma, also
celebrated the return of the sixth Mercury astronaut from space.
<P>The fact that Cooper, like Glenn, had had to take action to save his mission
from a probable failure added luster and meaning to the glory he received. While
postflight inspections, data reduction, and mission analyses proceeded through
the following month to pinpoint the causes of the few electromechanical faults
of the flight, Mercury systems engineers could find no fault with pilot
performance. Physicians, however, were cautious about the implications for
longer space missions of Cooper's hemodynamic response.
<P>[503] Probably no other result of the MA-9 mission excited more interest than
Cooper's claim to have seen from orbit objects on the ground as small as trucks
and houses. Skepticism on this point abated after the astronaut explained in
detail to representative scientists at the Cape on May 21 just where, when, and
how he could see dust and smoke below, from 100 miles directly above - if the
contrast was right. Also at this, the first and only "scientific debriefing"
following a Mercury flight, the value of extensive questioning of the subject
pilot was clearly demonstrated, when Cooper was asked whether he could see
Earthshine on the Moon. "Well," he replied, "the Moon was fuller as it was
setting than it was on the nightside. It was almost a full Moon. Gee, that's
funny, I hadn't even realized that before. It seemed to be almost full as it was
setting, whereas on the nightside it was only a third of a Moon."<A
href="notes.htm#n14.59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
This Moonshine was clearly Earthshine. Other postflight analyses added praise
for the sunshine that blessed <I>Faith 7</I>. "The sun literally smiled on
MA-9," wrote J. C. Jackson and Niles R. Heller in Goddard's report of the
network radio performance. "It [MA-9] was favored with better than average radio
frequency propagation conditions for the present phase of the solar sunspot
cycle."<A

<H3>Whither Gemini?</H3>On June 6 and 7, 1963, Brainerd Holmes, Gilruth, Walter
Williams, and Kleinknecht met with Administrator Webb, Hugh L. Dryden, and
Seamans in Washington to make a final decision on whether to fly an MA-10
mission. President Kennedy had clearly left the decision up to NASA. Webb
listened thoughtfully to the presentations of each NASA official, and although
both he and President Kennedy had heard the Mercury astronauts' plea for one
more Mercury mission, Administrator Webb announced before the Senate space
committee on June 12, 1963, that "we will not have another Mercury flight."<A
href="notes.htm#n14.61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
It was to be 22 months before another American manned space flight.
<P>Project Gemini, designed in 1961 to double the volume while retaining the
basic shape and systems of the McDonnell-Mercury spacecraft, now was well into
the development and redesign phase of construction. And the Martin Company's
mighty Titan II rocket, in spite of a recent explosion on launch, had a record
of nine cleancut successes out of 16 launches. Another Mercury-Atlas flight
would have been a relatively economical way to extend space technology and fill
the time (then estimated at a year) before Gemini-Titan could be flight-tested.
But now that Project Apollo, employing a concept called lunar orbital rendezvous
(LOR) to land a man on the Moon and recover him, was the ultimate goal of the
decade, space rendezvous and docking had to be perfected. Mercury had served far
more than its original purpose, but it could hardly be maneuverable. And so
Project Gemini was designed to fill these gaps. As people were asking whither
and whether Gemini was taking them, Mercury died a natural death, while Apollo
and Saturn were aborning.
