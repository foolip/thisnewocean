<H1>Environmental Control</H1>
High-altitude atmospheric flight had necessitated 
much work related to two serious physiological problems of space flight - air 
supply and the pressure required for breathing in space. Research on these 
problems in the United States stretched back to 1918, when the Army began 
operation of a decompression chamber at Hazelhurst Field, Long Island. In the 
early 1930s the civilian aviator [47] Wiley Post wore a pressure suit, looking 
like a deep-sea diver's outfit, for high-altitude flying. By the early fifties 
the typical jet pilot breathed pure oxygen for hours in an artificially 
pressurized cabin while wearing a pressurized flying suit as an extra protection 
in case of cabin decompression.<A

<P>Air compression, however, is not practicable above 80,000 feet. Travel 
outside the breathable atmosphere, whether into space or to the bottom of the 
sea, necessitates living inside a hermetically sealed compartment, a completely 
airtight ecological system in which carbon dioxide exhaled by the traveler is 
constantly replaced by an onboard supply of pure oxygen or some combination 
approximating the nitrogen-oxygen composition at sea level. In this area of 
space flight research - space cabin environment - the Air Force achieved 
preeminence in the early fifties with the development of the first sealed space 
cabin.
<P>The sealed space cabin had two essential precursors. One was the sealed 
gondola for stratospheric ballooning, used by the Swiss twins Auguste and Jean 
Piccard in several flights to altitudes of around 10 miles in the 1930s and in 
the <I>Explorer II </I>ascent of 1935, which carried Army experimenters Orvil A. 
Anderson and A. W. Stevens to 72,335 feet and set a record that stood for 20 
years.<A

The other was the closed underwater environment of the bathysphere, used for 
many years in deep-sea exploration, and of the submarine. In the fifties, Air 
Force research on the sealed space cabin paralleled similar work by Navy 
scientists on an environmental control system for the new atomic-powered 
submarines, which were being designed to remain totally submerged for months.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-5.htm#source43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>In 1952, Fritz Haber, of the Air Force School of Aviation Medicine, drew 
blueprints for a sealed chamber to be used for space medicine research; at the 
urging of Hubertus Strughold the Air Force let a contract for its construction. 
The Guardite Company of Chicago delivered a completed cabin in the summer of 
1954.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-5.htm#source44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> 
"Nobody took notice of a 'sealed cabin,'" recalled Strughold. "We had to have a 
name that would attract attention to our work. So I named it the 'Space Cabin 
Simulator.'"<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-5.htm#source45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
<P>The cabin provided about 100 cubic feet of living space, room enough for an 
ordinary aircraft seat and a panel of lights, switches, and displays to test the 
psychological reactions of the subject. It had systems for air conditioning, 
oxygen supply and carbon dioxide absorption, urine distillation, and the 
recycling of the distilled urine together with air moisture to provide water 
pure enough to drink. Cabin pressure was maintained constantly at a level 
equivalent to an altitude of 18,000 to 25,000 feet.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-5.htm#source46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>The space cabin simulator received its first national publicity in March 
1956, when Airman D. F. Smith spent 24 hours in the chamber at San Antonio, 
performing a number of tasks for psychological monitoring and wearing 
instrumentation to record his heart action, temperature, and respiration rate. 
During the next two years, Lieutenant Colonel George R. Steinkamp, Captain 
Julian Ward, and George T. Hauty, who had charge of the simulations, gradually 
increased the duration of the tests. On February 16, 1958, four and a half 
months after [48] <I>Sputnik I</I> and after seven days in the sealed chamber, 
Airman Donald F. Farrell stepped out to be greeted by a crowd of newsmen and by 
Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. In this, the most famous experiment ever run in the 
original space cabin simulator, Farrell had spent his week completely isolated 
in an environment that duplicated life inside a spacecraft in every respect 
except the weightless condition.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-5.htm#source47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>The Farrell experiment provided no unexpected physiological data. But Hauty, 
chiefly interested in the psychological portion of the simulation, reported that 
the daily log kept by Farrell showed a deterioration from good spirits to "the 
seemingly abrupt onset of frank hostility." Farrell's mental condition "reached 
the point of becoming the single conceivable reason for a premature termination 
of the flight." Hauty noted that Farrell's proficiency at tasks assigned to him 
also deteriorated severely as the experiment progressed.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-5.htm#source48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>The psychological data from the early space cabin simulator tests, as well as 
observation of subjects in the isolation chamber at Wright-Patterson Air Force 
Base, were not encouraging. Major Charles A. Berry, an Air Force physician who 
later would work closely with the astronauts in Project Mercury, perhaps 
expressed the consensus among space medicine investigators by 1958: "The 
psychological problems presented by the exposure of man to an isolated, 
uncomfortable void seem to be more formidable than the physiological 
problems."<A

weightless and sealed-cabin programs, the School of Aviation Medicine carried on 
various other research activities in space medicine. As early as 1947 scientists 
at the school were studying the ecological conditions on other planets. From 
this and other research came Strughold's <I>The Green and Red Planet: A 
Physiological Study of the Possibility of Life on Mars</I> (Albuquerque, 1953). 
Throughout the 1950s and to the present the Department of Space Medicine at the 
school has done research on the atmospheric composition of other planets, 
photosynthesis as a means of air supply, and other subjects.

States and Canada conducted sensory deprivation studies, laboratory experiments 
in which a subject was immersed in water in a blackened room and thus was 
deprived of his visual, auditory, and kinesthetic senses. The experiments 
indicated "a general loosening of the subject's ability to perceive reality and 
the weakening of the stable norms against which perception is evaluated." Later 
studies at the Navy Air Crew Equipment Laboratory in Philadelphia, the Air Force 
School of Medicine, and the Wright Air Development Center demonstrated, however, 
that stable, well-trained persons "can endure severe restrictions of their 
natural habitat for relatively long periods of time without significant 
degradation." Gerathewohl, <I>Principles of Bioastronautics</I>, 308, 311. See
