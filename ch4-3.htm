<H1>NACA's Metamorphosis Begins</H1>The explanation for Wood's action and for 
the general prudence of NACA in dealing with the Air Force on space matters in 
the spring of 1958 lay in the contents of the space bill sent by the Eisenhower 
administration to Capitol Hill on April 14 and then being debated in Congress. 
This proposal appeared likely to transform NACA into the focal point of the 
nation's efforts in space.
<P>From the initial discussions in 1954 of a United States International 
Geophysical Year satellite project, President Eisenhower's position had been 
that space activities should be conducted solely for peaceful purposes. The 
nature and objectives of Project Vanguard had reflected this policy. He summed 
up his feelings in a letter to Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin, dated January 
12, 1958. Describing the demilitarization of space as "the most important 
problem which faces the world today," he proposed that - 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . . outer space should be used only for peaceful purposes. . . . 
  can we not stop the production of such weapons which would use or, more 
  accurately, misuse, outer space, now for the first time opening up as a field 
  for man's exploration? Should not outer space be dedicated to the peaceful 
  uses of mankind and denied to the purposes of war? . . .<A

<P>Consistent with this "space for peace" policy, the concentration on February 
7, 1958, of Federal space activities in the Advanced Research Projects Agency of 
the Defense Department had been only an interim measure pending establishment of 
a new, civilian-controlled space management organization. Shortly before the 
creation of ARPA, Eisenhower had turned to his newly appointed, 18-member 
President's Scientific Advisory Committee (PSAC), chaired by President James R. 
Killian, Jr., of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and including among 
its members NACA Chairman Doolittle. Eisenhower instructed the Committee to draw 
up two documents: a broad policy statement familiarizing Americans with space 
and justifying Government-financed astronautical ventures, and a recommendation 
for organizing a national program in space science. The "Killian committee," as 
the early PSAC was called, chose two subcommittees. One, on policy, was headed 
by Edward H. Purcell, a physicist and executive vice-president of Bell Telephone 
Laboratories; the other, on organization, was led by Harvard University 
physicist James B. Fisk.
<P>The Fisk subcommittee on organization finished its work first. After talking 
with Doolittle and NACA Director Dryden, Fisk and his colleagues made a crucial 
report to PSAC late in February. A new agency built around NACA should be 
created to carry out a comprehensive national program in astronautics, 
emphasizing peaceful, civilian-controlled research and development. The White 
House Advisory Committee on Government Organization, consisting of Nelson B. 
Rockefeller, [83] Killian, and Maurice H. Stans, Director of the Bureau of the 
Budget, used this PSAC subcommittee report as the basis for a formal 
recommendation on a national space organization, which Eisenhower received and 
approved on March 5. Five months after <I>Sputnik I, </I>the administration began 
drawing up proposed legislation for consideration by the Congress. As Dryden 
later observed, NACA's cautious post-Sputnik strategy had "paid off, in the long 
run."
<P>PSAC's rationale for space exploration, entitled "Introduction to Outer 
Space," was issued on March 26. This statement proclaimed that "the compelling 
urge of man to explore and to discover," "the defense objective," "national 
prestige," and "new opportunities for scientific observation and experiment" 
were "four factors which give importance, urgency, and inevitability to the 
advancement of space technology."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source28"><SUP>28</A></SUP>
<P>On April 2, Eisenhower sent his formal message on space matters to Congress. 
The document again indicated the President's intense conviction that space 
should be primarily reserved for scientific exploration, not military 
exploitation. It called for the establishment of a "National Aeronautical and 
Space Agency," which would absorb NACA and assume responsibility for all "space 
activities . . . except . . . those projects primarily associated with military 
requirements." The executive authority in the new organization would be 
exercised by one person, a director, who would be advised by a 17-member 
"National Aeronautical and Space Board." The proposal for a loose advisory board 
represented little more than an extension of the NACA Main Committee. The idea 
for a single executive, however, stemmed mainly from the opinions of 
Eisenhower's legislative experts and the officials of the Bureau of the Budget. 
They wanted authority in the new agency to be centralized, not diffused in a 
committee as was the case with NACA and the Atomic Energy Commission. The second 
and more critical departure from NACA history was Eisenhower's stipulation that 
the proposed organization would have not only research but development, 
managerial, and flight operational responsibilities. Unlike NACA, then, it would 
possess extensive authority for contracting research and development projects.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source29"><SUP>29</A></SUP>
<P>Twelve days later, on April 14, the Eisenhower administration sent to the 
Democratic-controlled Congress its bill to create such an agency, drafted 
largely by the Bureau of the Budget.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source30"><SUP>30</A></SUP> 
In the House of Representatives and the Senate, special committees began 
hearings on the bill. The measure would undergo extensive amendment and 
reworking at the hands of the legislators. But it soon was apparent that a new 
agency would come into being, that NACA would constitute its nucleus, and that 
it would undertake large-scale development and operational activities in 
addition to research. The odds were better than good that a manned satellite 
project would fall within the domain of the civilian organization.
<P>Proceeding on this assumption, engineers working at all of the NACA 
installations - at the ranges and wind tunnels at Langley and Ames, in the 
high-temperature jet facilities and rocket-test chambers at Lewis and Langley, 
at the [84] rocket launch pads and control panels on Wallops Island, and in the 
flight hangars at the High Speed Flight Station - stepped up their research in 
materials, aerodynamics, and control.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source31"><SUP>31</A></SUP> 
By early 1958, according to Preston R. Bassett, chairman of NACA's renamed 
Committee on Aircraft, Missile, and Spacecraft Aerodynamics, approximately 55 
percent of all NACA activity was already applicable to space flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source32"><SUP>32</A></SUP> 
According to another set of NACA statistics, the Pilotless Aircraft Research 
Division (PARD) was expending 90 percent of its effort on space and missile 
research; the rest of the Langley laboratory, 40 percent; Ames, 29 percent; and 
Lewis, 36 percent.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source33"><SUP>33</A></SUP> 
Virtually every member of NACA's technical staff eagerly anticipated a national 
program of space exploration. Since the raison d'être of NACA always had been to 
improve the performance of piloted aircraft, most NACA engineers viewed manned 
space flight as an even more challenging and rewarding form of activity.
<P>[85] Not everyone in the NACA laboratories, however, was convinced that the 
agency's destiny lay in developing hardware, managing programs, and carrying out 
satellite launchings. Many scientist-engineers subscribed wholeheartedly to the 
official NACA position enunciated by Headquarters in January and February: While 
NACA ought to labor mightily in the furtherance of space science, it should 
continue to solve problems posed by other agencies engaged in development and 
operations, not handle programs itself. The "research-minded" element within the 
NACA technical staff probably was strongest at Ames. Most of the Ames complement 
had gone to work for NACA because of the nature of the organization. Its 
quasi-academic focus on research, its receptiveness to new and sometimes radical 
concepts, its relative obscurity and freedom from politics appealed to them. At 
the California institution the prospect of managing programs, which entailed 
fighting for appropriations, wrangling with industrial contractors, and perhaps 
competing with the military, seemed exceedingly distasteful.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source34"><SUP>34</A></SUP>
<P>This attitude was not so prevalent at the two other laboratories or at the 
High Speed Flight Station. The years of direct participation with Air Force, 
Navy, and contract personnel in the research aircraft projects had given Walter 
Williams and his staff at the Flight Station a rather clear operational 
orientation, albeit with airplanes and not with space rockets and satellites. 
The Lewis and Langley staffs included a sizable number of research workers who, 
while enjoying the intellectual liberty of NACA, felt it would be quite a 
challenge to carry out a program of their own instead of simply providing advice 
for the military and industry. They looked on approvingly as the Eisenhower 
administration sent to Congress a measure substantially embodying their ideas.
<P>The academic approach to aeronautics and astronautics pervaded much of 
Langley, the oldest and in some ways the most tradition-minded of the NACA 
laboratories. The commitment to basic research and the devotion to theoretical 
calculations and wind tunnels as the most efficacious means of gathering 
aerodynamic data were as strong among some Langley engineers as among the Ames 
investigators. But in the Flight Research, Instrument Research, and Pilotless 
Aircraft Research Divisions at Langley; at the semiautonomous Pilotless Aircraft 
Research Station on Wallops Island, 70 miles away across Chesapeake Bay; and in 
the Flight Research Division at Lewis, there were people who had gained the bulk 
of their experience by working with airfoils mounted on the wings of airplanes 
in flight and from air-launched and ground-launched scale models propelled by 
rockets. For years they had been close to "development" and "operations" in 
their research activities, but they had turned their telemetered findings over 
to someone else for practical application. Now it seemed that the Soviet 
artificial moons might have given these ambitious aeronautical engineers a 
chance to put their imagination and technical experience to use in a manned 
space flight program. As Paul E. Purser, then head of the High Temperature 
Branch of PARD, put it, "In early 1958 we simply assumed we would get the manned 
satellite project. So we started to work."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>[86] Over the years the PARD specialists had perfected their techniques of 
launch, guidance, automatic control, and telemetry on small rockets, and had 
steadily added to the mountain of experimental data on hypervelocity performance 
and aerodynamic heating. Their rockets, while remaining small in thrust and 
payload, had become more and more sophisticated. During 1957, by firing 
five-stage research rockets, they had been able to achieve a final-stage 
velocity of mach 16.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source36"><SUP>36</A></SUP> 
And they already were doing conceptual work on a new and larger multistage 
research rocket, designed to boost scale models in their own stability and 
heat-transfer studies and to send up small instrumented satellites and space 
probes for the Air Force. Later called the Scout, this four- or five-stage, 
solid-propellant configuration could fire its stages sequentially to place 
either a 150-pound payload in a 300-mile orbit, 100 pounds in a 
5,000-to-10,000-mile orbit, or 30 pounds in an orbit more than 22,000 miles from 
Earth.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source37">`<SUP>37</A></SUP>
<P>In the hectic weeks and months following the Soviet satellite launchings, the 
advocates of manned space flight at Langley, realizing that their experience in 
nose-cone research was directly transferable to the design of manned satellite 
vehicles, turned their attention to spacecraft design as never before. NACA's 
initial agreement of March 14, 1958, to collaborate with the Air Force in 
drawing up plans for a manned orbital project gave official sanction to research 
they already had been doing largely on their own time. Theoretically this work 
still was in support of the Air Force and industrial manned-satellite studies. 
As it turned out, the Langley engineers were doing the early development work 
for their own enterprise, later to become Project Mercury.
<P>The sparkplug behind much of this activity was Maxime A. Faget, head of the 
Performance Aerodynamics Branch in PARD. Thirty-seven years old in 1958, Faget 
had been born in British Honduras, the son of an honored physician in the United 
States Public Health Service. In 1943, when his father was developing sulfone 
drugs for the National Leprosarium in Carville, Louisiana, the diminutive Faget 
received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Louisiana 
State University. After his discharge from the Navy's submarine service in 1946, 
he joined the staff at Langley. He soon devised choking inlets for ramjets, a 
flight mach number meter, and several mathematical formulas for deriving data 
from Richard T. Whitcomb's area rule.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source38"><SUP>38</A></SUP> 
Like Robert R. Gilruth and others before him at Langley, Faget preferred to 
enlarge his knowledge in aerodynamics and thermodynamics not in wind tunnels but 
by observing and telemetering data from vehicles in free flight.
<P>In mid-March, less than a week after the conclusion of the Air Force 
man-in-space working conference in Los Angeles, Gilruth, as Assistant Director 
of Langley, called Faget and his other top engineers together to determine what 
should be the "Langley position" on optimum spacecraft configurations at the 
NACA Conference on High-Speed Aerodynamics, to be held at the Ames laboratory 
beginning March 18. The consensus of the meeting was that the Langley-PARD 
representatives should present a united front at Ames behind a ballistic 
concept.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source39"><SUP>39</A></SUP>
<P>[87] The Conference on High-Speed Aerodynamics, the last in a long line of 
full-dress symposiums held by NACA, attracted most of the luminaries in the 
organization, including Dryden, Silverstein, Eggers, H. Julian Allen, Walter 
Williams, and the members of the Committee on Aircraft, Missile, and Spacecraft 
Aerodynamics. Military personnel and representatives of most of the aircraft and 
missile firms also attended this forum. The 46 papers read at the conference, 
dealing with hypersonic, satellite, and interplanetary flight, represented the 
most advanced thinking in aerodynamics within NACA. Taken together, the papers 
demonstrated how far some NACA engineers trained in aeronautics had pushed their 
research into the new discipline of astronautics.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source40"><SUP>40</A></SUP>
<P>Much interest centered around three presentations proposing alternative 
configurations for manned orbital flight. The first of these papers was authored 
by Faget, Benjamine J. Garland, and James J. Buglia. Faget presented it as the 
orbital configuration regarded most favorably by PARD personnel - the wingless, 
nonlifting vehicle. Faget and his associates pointed out several advantages of 
this simple ballistic approach. In the first place, ballistic missile research, 
development, and production experience was directly applicable to the design and 
construction of such a vehicle. The fact that it would be fired along a 
ballistic path meant that automatic stabilization, guidance, and control 
equipment could be kept at a minimum, thus saving weight and diminishing the 
likelihood of a malfunction.
<P>The nonlifting vehicle simplified return from orbit because the only 
necessary maneuver was the firing of retrograde rockets - "retrorockets" - to 
decelerate the spacecraft, deflecting it from orbit and subjecting it to 
atmospheric drag. And even that maneuver need not be too precise for the 
accomplishment of a safe recovery. After retrofire, successful entry depended 
solely on the inherent stability and structural soundness of the ballistic 
vehicle. Faget, Garland, and Buglia acknowledged that the pure-drag device 
necessitated landing in a large and imprecisely defined area, using a parachute, 
and dispensing with lifting and braking controls to correct the rate of descent, 
the direction, or the impact force. Rather severe oscillations might occur 
during descent. But Faget and his associates noted that tests with 
model ballistic capsules in the 20-foot-diameter, free-spinning tunnel at Langley 
had shown that attitude control jets, such as those used on the X-1B, X-2, and 
X-15 rocketplanes, could provide rate damping and help correct the oscillations, 
while a small drogue parachute should give still more stability.
<P>The three Langley engineers went so far as to propose a specific, if 
rudimentary, ballistic configuration - a nearly flat-faced cone angled about 15 
degrees from the vertical, 11 feet long and 7 feet in diameter, using a heat 
sink rather than an ablative covering for thermal protection. Although the space 
passenger would lie supine against the heatshield at all times, during orbital 
flight the capsule would reverse its attitude so that the deceleration loads of 
reentry would be imposed from front to back through the man's body, the same as 
under [89] acceleration. The authors concluded that "as far as reentry and 
recovery is concerned [sic], the state-of-the-art is sufficiently advanced so 
that it is possible to proceed confidently with a manned satellite project based 
upon the ballistic reentry type of vehicle."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source41"><SUP>41</A></SUP>
<P>One dissenter from the Langley consensus favoring a manned projectile was 
John Becker, of the Langley Compressibility Research Division and a veteran of 
X-15 development, who read a paper at the conference on possible winged 
satellite configurations. Becker's main concern was the reentry heating problem 
in conjunction with some maneuverability within the atmosphere. Combining his 
theoretical findings with those of Charles W. Mathews of Langley, Becker 
suggested a glider-like configuration. Instead of entering the atmosphere at a 
low angle of attack and using lift to return to Earth, it would deliberately 
come in at a high angle of attack, employing its lower wing surface as a 
heatshield. Deceleration loads still could be held at a little over 1 g in this 
fashion. The gross weight of such a low-lift, high-drag vehicle would be only 
about 3,060 pounds. "Thus . . . the minimum winged satellite vehicle is not 
prohibitively heavier than the drag type," concluded Becker. "The weight is 
sufficiently low to permit launching by booster systems similar to that for the 
drag vehicle described in a previous paper by Maxime A. Faget, Benjamine J. 
Garland, and James J. Buglia."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source42"><SUP>42</A></SUP>
<P>What some Langley researchers had come to regard as the "Ames position" on 
manned satellites was described in a paper by Thomas J. Wong, Charles A. 
Hermach, John O. Reller, and Bruce E. Tinling, four aeronautical engineers who 
had worked with Eggers. They presented a polished, more detailed version of the 
blunt, semilifting M-1 configuration conceived by Eggers the previous summer. 
For such a vehicle a lift/drag ratio of 1/2 could be effected simply by removing 
the upper portion of a pure ballistic shape, making the body somewhat deeper 
than that of a half-cone, and adding trailing edge flaps for longitudinal and 
lateral control. Maximum deceleration forces would be only 2 g, low enough to 
permit a pilot to remain in control of his vehicle. Blunting would reduce heat 
conduction; the vehicle would be stable and controllable down to subsonic speeds 
and would provide substantial maneuverability; and structural weight would 
remain relatively low. Thus "it appears that a high-lift, high-drag configuration 
of the type discussed has attractive possibilities for the reentry of a 
satellite vehicle."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source43"><SUP>43</A></SUP>
<P>The Ames engineers' presentation was not in the form of a spacecraft design 
challenge to the Langley-PARD aerodynamicists. Eggers and various others at Ames 
remained convinced of the overall superiority of the lifting body for manned 
satellite missions. But as Eggers explained, "Ames was not enthusiastic in 1958 
to participate in an operational program for building and launching spacecraft 
of any kind, manned or unmanned."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source44"><SUP>44</A></SUP> 
While some Ames people were rather avidly pushing the M-1 concept, their avidity 
did not stem from any desire for operational dominance in a civilian space 
program. [90] The California NACA scientists were quite willing to leave the 
business of building prototypes, carrying out full-scale tests, and then 
managing a program to their more "hardware-oriented" colleagues across the 
continent.
<P>To Faget, Purser, and Gilruth the choice between the semilifting 
configuration favored by the Ames group and their nonlifting device really was 
an academic one. Given the assumption that a manned satellite should be fired 
into orbit as quickly as possible, then the Atlas ICBM, not the still untested 
Titan or a Thor-fluorine combination, should serve as the launch vehicle for a 
one-ton spacecraft. The Atlas was following a tortuous route toward status as a 
reliable operational rocket, but it was still the only ICBM anywhere near being 
ready. The criterion already adopted by Faget and his associates, that an 
attempt to orbit a man should follow the simplest, quickest, and most dependable 
approach, negated a heavier, semilifting vehicle; this would have required 
adding an extra stage to the Atlas or some other rocket. The same criterion even 
ruled out Becker's low-lift, high-drag proposal. If the first manned orbital 
project was to adhere to and profit from ballistic missile experience, then the 
capabilities of the Atlas should be the first consideration. Faget himself did 
not have detailed data on the Atlas' design performance before, during, or for 
some time after the Ames conference; such information was highly classified and 
he lacked an official "need to know." About two months after he delivered his 
paper he learned through conversations with Frank J. Dore, an engineer-executive 
of Convair, what he needed to design a manned ballistic payload.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source45"><SUP>45</A></SUP> 
In the weeks following the Ames conference, Faget's and other Langley-PARD 
research teams, centering their efforts on the basic ballistic shape, started 
working out the details of hurling a man-carrying projectile around the world.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-3.htm#source46"><SUP>46</A></SUP>
<P>While the engineers at the NACA Virginia installations hurried their designs, 
tests, and plans, and while Congress received Eisenhower's space bill, the 
organizational transformation of NACA began. After the White House Advisory 
Committee on Government Organization recommended that a national civilian space 
program be built around NACA, Director Dryden and his subordinates in Washington 
began planning the revamping that would have to accompany the reorientation of 
NACA functions. Dryden called Abe Silverstein of Lewis to Washington to begin 
organizing a spaceflight development program. On April 2, as part of his space 
message to Congress, Eisenhower instructed NACA and the Defense Department to 
review the projects then under ARPA to determine which should be transferred to 
the new civilian space agency. NACA and Defense Department representatives, in 
consultation with Bureau of the Budget officials, reached tentative agreements 
on the disposition of practically all the projects and facilities in question, 
with the notable exception of manned space flight. In accordance with 
Eisenhower's directive that NACA "describe the internal organization, management 
structure, staff, facilities, and funds which will be required," NACA set up an 
ad hoc committee on organization under the chairmanship of Assistant Director 
Ira Abbott.<A
