<H1>Redevelopment for MA-9</H1>The flight of <I>Sigma 7</I> had been so nearly 
idyllic that some observers, whether from cynicism or a kind of parental 
possessiveness, believed Project Mercury should be concluded on Schirra's 
positive note. Any further attempt at manned satellite flight with this 
first-generation hardware might press the program's luck too far and end sourly, 
if not calamitously. To cancel Mercury now would ensure the reputation of the 
project. Others argued it would sacrifice the living potential, [487] as well as 
the intense desire, of the Mercury team to test man in space for one full day.<A

<P>Among Manned Spacecraft Center officials, there was no real decision to be 
made here; Mercury had begun in earnest in 1959 with a vision of an ultimate 
18-orbit mission. But by October 1959, the inexorable growth in capsule weight 
and power requirements and the limitations of the network had forced the Space 
Task Group to erase that vision. The 18-orbit mission for Mercury had been 
revived by the summer of 1961, in conjunction with serious planning for Project 
Apollo and for a "Mark II" ballistic capsule design. And when Project Gemini was 
publicly named on January 3, 1962, as an interim program to fill the void before 
Apollo could be developed, Mercury engineers were already diving headlong toward 
the revived 18-orbit, 27-hour mission.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>During the period from September 1961 to January 1962, the word "capsule" had 
been erased from Mercury vocabulary in favor of the word "spacecraft." It was 
then that the Space Task Group (STG) became Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC), and 
NASA Headquarters reorganized Abe Silverstein's Office of Space Flight Programs 
into an Office of Manned Space Flight under a new director, D. Brainerd Holmes. 
In the midst of all this confusion, one thing had been clear: a Mercury 
spacecraft would have to fill the gaps in space, time, and knowledge before a 
Project Gemini two-man capsule could be developed and qualified. Although the 
physiological effects of extended exposure to weightlessness were still of 
primary interest, the only local policy issue was whether to adopt another 
change in nomenclature. Should the day-long sustained space flight be called 
MA-9 or Manned One-Day Mission (MODM)?<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>Throughout the spring and summer of 1962, Mercury engineers, both at NASA 
centers and in St. Louis, had studied various design proposals for advanced 
versions of the ballistic spacecraft. The first Gemini capsule mockup review had 
been held at the factory on March 29, about the same time that Lewis R. Fisher, 
James E. Bost, William M. Bland, Jr., Robert T. Everline, and others had 
completed the specifications for a Mercury spacecraft for the manned one-day 
flight. Not until September, however, were negotiations settled with McDonnell 
over configuration changes to the four capsules set aside for this purpose (Nos. 
12, 15, 17, and 20). A week before the Schirra flight, NASA Headquarters 
announced a new plan to phase Mercury into Gemini more quickly, if MA-8 and MA-9 
met all expectations.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>After Schirra, Atlas 113-D, and <I>Sigma 7</I> excelled those expectations in 
nearly every respect, the Manned Spacecraft Center forwarded its sixteenth 
quarterly status report to NASA Headquarters, claiming: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This report will be the final in the series of Project MERCURY, as 
  such, since the MA-8 flight was the last mission of Project MERCURY. Future 
  reports, although they will continue with the following number (17), will be 
  on the status of the Manned One-Day Mission (MODM) Project (MERCURY 
  Spacecraft).</BLOCKQUOTE>[489] Robert Gilruth's team, now located in temporary 
quarters at 13 buildings scattered over southeast Houston, was planning on an 
April 1963 launch date for MA-9, using spacecraft No. 20. On November 9, 1962, 
MSC's senior staff decided to aim for 22 rather than 18 orbits (or 34 rather 
than 27 hours), if all went normally.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
<P>Walter Williams, Christopher Kraft, and Kenneth Kleinknecht proceeded to 
coordinate the mission planning with the Defense Department. This flight would 
involve vastly expanded support, because MA-9 was to criss-cross virtually all 
of Earth's surface between latitudes 33 degrees north and south of the equator. 
L. Gordon Cooper was officially announced as the pilot and Alan Shepard was 
named alternate in mid-November. McDonnell had estimated that this mission alone 
would cost $17,879,834 to complete, but as yet the Air Force, Navy, and Army 
participants had not conferred with NASA about new needs for the recovery 
network and medical support.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> 
Clearly the MA-9 operation would not be able to challenge the 64-orbit feat of 
Nikolayev in <I>Vostok III</I> nor the 48 orbits of Popovich in the tandem 
<I>Vostok IV</I>, but MA-9 should go well beyond Titov's 17 orbits in <I>Vostok 
II</I>.
<P>Meanwhile NASA and the Manned Spacecraft Center took their cues from 
President Kennedy and Administrator James E. Webb to mobilize greater effort 
toward the longer-range goals symbolized by Project Apollo. Only 55 persons 
staffed Kleinknecht's Mercury Project Office specifically to coordinate the 
diverse preparations for MA-9. Of the 2500 people employed by MSC in January 
1963, only 500 were working directly on Mercury. The Gemini and Apollo teams 
were rapidly taking shape. NASA had just honored a group of nine old-time 
engineers from the Space Task Group as the "Mercury Spacecraft Inventors." The 
list of innovators was headed by Maxime A. Faget, and included Andre J. Meyer, 
Jr., William Bland, Alan B. Kehlet, Willard S. Blanchard, Robert G. Chilton, 
Jerome B. Hammack, Caldwell C. Johnson, and Jack C. Heberlig. But of that group 
of designers and developers, only Bland still remained employed in the Mercury 
Project Office. The rest had gone to work on Gemini and Apollo.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>One of the more significant New Year's resolutions enacted by NASA in 1963 
was the appointment of a Manned Space Science Planning Group and of a Panel on 
Inflight Scientific Experiments, known informally as POISE, chaired respectively 
by Eugene M. Shoemaker and John A. O'Keefe. These two new groups were 
established to replace the Ad Hoc Committee on Scientific Tasks and Training for 
Man-in-Space and to ensure closer coordination between the Manned Spacecraft 
Center and the NASA Office of Space Sciences. They were only temporary 
expedients, staffed by most of the same people who had served earlier as 
consultants, but at least the manned space science programs for Gemini would be 
born more respectably than those for Mercury.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>At the first MSC senior staff meeting in 1963, Walter Williams warned his 
colleagues that two recent failures in Atlas-F launchings by the Air Force were 
inexplicable, or so far, at least, unexplained. Unless investigating committees 
[490] could clear up these failures soon, absolving the Atlas-D from any guilt 
by association, the MA-9 schedule might suffer. After five years of 
developmental experience, the Atlas ICBM had approached but still not attained a 
reliability high enough for comfort. The Atlas, even as modified and 
"gold-plated" by the "man-rating" tests and procedures, was still basically a 
ballistic missile, only converted and not designed to launch men into space. 
After five consecutive Mercury-Atlas launches without a failure, it was all too 
easy to forget this fact.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> 
When the 130-D, Cooper's "bird," was first rolled out of the factory in San 
Diego on January 30, it failed to pass inspection and was returned for some 
rewiring.
<P>Amid some charges from impatient newsmen that NASA had "muzzled" Cooper, the 
prime pilot took time out on February 8 to hold a press conference in Houston 
that refuted such public speculation. Cooper forthrightly admitted what little 
he knew about the booster problem and answered in picturesque detail a host of 
questions about new developments for his space suit, his spacecraft, his 
mission. "This is going to practically be a flying camera," he said, explaining 
the new slow–scan television monitor, the 70-millimeter Hasselblad and its 
different film packs, the special zodiacal-light 35-millimeter camera, and a 
16-millimeter, all-purpose moving-picture camera. Cooper had difficulty 
convincing some reporters that the duration of the MA-9 mission would depend on 
how well it went - for "as many as 22 orbits" - and that he was still 
"struggling" to find a suitable name for spacecraft No. 20. But otherwise he 
talked freely about the most significant differences between the MA-8 and MA-9 
spacecraft, although obviously he could not name all 183 of the changes then 
underway at McDonnell's Canaveral shop.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
<P>Weight growth had been the primary nemesis in preparing for every Mercury 
mission, and this was especially true for the day-long mission. As is 
characteristic perhaps of all American technology, and especially of advanced 
modifications to military aircraft, overweight accessories tended to compromise 
the vehicles' performance. In the case of the MODM spacecraft, heavier batteries 
for more electrical power, another 4-pound bottle of oxygen, 9 pounds of cooling 
and 4.5 pounds of drinking water, plus 15 more pounds of peroxide fuel were 
imperative additions. Experimental gear, a full load of consumables for life 
support systems, and various modified components were also judged necessary, 
though heavier, installations. In an effort to compensate for these added 
weights, the 12-pound Rate Stabilization Control System (RSCS), a 3-pound UHF 
and a 2-pound telemetry transmitter, both of which were true redundancies now; 
and, in particular, the 76-pound periscope were deleted. Manned Spacecraft 
Center engineers almost discarded the fiber-glass couch in favor of a new 
hammock to shave away 17 more pounds, but that change did not materialize 
because the engineers feared the material might stretch and the astronaut 
bounce. So the MA-9 payload continued, through 31 weeks of grooming, to grow 
into an estimated weight of 3,026.3 pounds in orbit.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>Such weight increases had become expected, at the rate of about two pounds 
per week of preparation, and early in 1962 the Mercury managers had called for 
[491] an extensive requalification program of the parachute and landing system. 
Known as Project Reef, these tests had effectively allayed all fears about the 
ringsail parachutes' margin for error with heavier loads long before <I>Sigma 
7</I> gave an even better demonstration. At the beginning of 1963, NASA 
scientists from other centers were pleased to gain some voting strength on the 
20-man committee established nine months earlier to decide what in-flight 
scientific experiments should be conducted. But the majority voting strength of 
this panel still remained with MSC engineers, whose weight-consciousness and 
power-consciousness effectively stifled the transformation of MA-9 and 
spacecraft No. 20 into a more purely scientific orbital laboratory.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
<P>Another ground test program behind the scenes, namely Project Orbit, which by 
the end of February 1963 had completed a 100-hour full-scale simulated mission 
in its thermo-cryogenic vacuum chamber, stirred up concern that the reaction 
control thrusters might get sluggish or freeze during long periods of inactivity 
in space. In all other respects, Project Orbit seemed to certify that the 
McDonnell spacecraft and all subcontracted systems were ready and reliable for a 
full day or more up there.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile, the tiger teams at work on Atlas 130-D were exceptionally pleased 
when, on March 15, 1963, the second factory rollout and flight-acceptance 
inspections on this booster were completed without a single minor discrepancy. 
Philip E. Culbertson, Gus Groissant, John P. Hopman, and David R. Archibald of 
General Dynamics/Astronautics flew across the country to deliver to their test 
conductor at the Cape, Calvin D. Fowler, what they believed to be their best 
bird yet. Bernhard A. Hohmann and helpers at Aerospace Corporation had defined 
an offset of the booster engines to counteract the threatening roll rate that 
Schirra had experienced at liftoff. And on April 22 spacecraft and rocket were 
mated.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>By the end of April, all plans and preparations had been well laid and 
revised in accord with the precedents and lessons of previous flights. The 
detailed flight plan, technical information summaries, calculated preflight 
trajectory data, public information directives, experiments guidebook, and 
documentation directives were all disseminated. The world was girdled by 
military and medical recovery personnel waiting for May 14 and the launch of 
Gordon Cooper. A total of 28 ships, 171 aircraft, and about 18,000 servicemen 
were assigned to support MA-9. These included 84 medical specialists, a 
reduction by half in the number of medical monitors and corpsmen since Glenn's 
flight. This was a token of the confidence the planners now had in Mercury and 
its men.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>But that confidence was not shared by everyone. While Cooper struggled to 
select the most appropriate name for his capsule, criticism of NASA and its 
implementation of national space goals swelled once again. Philip H. Abelson, 
editor of <I>Science</I>, the journal of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science; Warren Weaver of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation; and 
Senator J. William Fulbright from Arkansas raised voices in protest against the 
Moon race and against manned space flight in general. The costs of manned 
orbital flight, [492] the confusion regarding "science" and "technology," and 
urgent social and political problems deserving equal attention were to be widely 
debated.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>Against this context, when Cooper finally announced his choice of a call-sign 
- <I>Faith 7</I>, symbolizing "my trust in God, my country, and my teammates" - 
NASA public affairs officers were described by the <I>Washington Post</I> as 
worried: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The naming of the bell-shaped capsule - a tradition accorded to 
  the astronaut riding it - has given Cooper some bad moments. He has picked 
  "Faith 7," which has drawn some raised eyebrows in the "image" conscious space 
  agency.
  <P>"Suppose that, for some reason, we lost the capsule at sea," said one 
  source. "Then it would come out reading something like, 'The United States 
  today lost Faith. . . .'"<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source49"><SUP>49</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>So 
much had happened, so many things had changed in the four years since Project 
Mercury had become publicized by the selection of its seven astronauts, that the 
Manned One-Day Mission seemed an appropriate new name to symbolize the 
differences. Now there was a second class of nine more astronauts-in-training; 
there was the national goal of a lunar landing before 1970; there were new 
facilities, new administrators, and thoroughly reorganized procedures and 
policies to follow. <I>Mariner II</I>, in its magnificent survey of Venus in 
December 1962, was interpreted a few months later as having proved Venus to be 
one destination in planetary space that might as well be forgotten as a target 
for manned landings. Mars remained a mystery, and so also did Earth's Moon, for 
that matter, but the decision to try Project Apollo made Mercury already merely 
a demigod. While Project Ozma used radio telescopes in a search for evidence of 
intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, <I>Telstar II</I> was launched May 
7, 1963, to renew the hope that Earthmen might exercise greater intelligence 
than they had in the past by establishing more intelligent communications with 
each other.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
<P>In the midst of the heat of scientific and political criticism of both 
Department of Defense and NASA space priorities and costs, NASA and the Mercury 
managers had to decide what, if anything, should be the next mission after MA-9. 
If Walter Williams and others at MSC had their way, an MA-10 mission, planned 
for a three-day sojourn in space, would follow. But they were overruled, and 
Julian Scheer, the new NASA Deputy Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs, 
announced emphatically on May 11, "It is absolutely beyond question that if this 
shot is successful there will be no MA-10."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>So Astronaut Cooper knew, as he made the final preparations after four years 
of training, that his flight would mark the end of the beginning. A well-known 
life insurance company subscribed to Cooper's faith by underwriting the first 
commercial astronaut policies, including one for Cooper. The Mercury operations 
team gathered at the Cape the second week in May and found <I>Faith 7</I>, Atlas 
130-D, and Cooper all ready to take off. Only the weatherman, Ernest A. Amman, 
voiced his doubts about the May 14 launch date.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>At 6:36 on the morning of May 14, Gordon Cooper was sealed inside his 
<I>Faith 7</I> spacecraft atop the steeple that was his Atlas. He checked off 
all his systems [493] and awaited completion of the blockhouse and Control 
Center checkoffs, which should count down to ignition about 9 o'clock and lift 
him up to insertion about 9: 05. A suction-cup force pump, the kind commonly 
called a "plumber's friend," had been Alan Shepard's parting gift to Cooper, but 
the instruction inscribed on the handle, "Remove before launch," had been 
obeyed. It would not make the long trip with Cooper.
<P>While waiting, Cooper heard the secondary control center on Bermuda report 
that its basic C-band radar system was misbehaving both in azimuth and range. So 
he napped for a time during repairs. When Bermuda had corrected the difficulty, 
at about 8 o'clock, the countdown was resumed, and the gantry was ordered back. 
But the diesel engine failed to move the gantry, and engineers scurried around, 
looking for the proper plumber's helper to repair a fouled fuel injection pump. 
[494] More than two exasperating hours were lost on the "fail-safe" diesel 
locomotive before the count could resume.
<P>At high noon, the gantry was driven back. But radar data from Bermuda, which 
was vital to the go/no go decision before the point of no return, now was 
intermittent. The launch was postponed. Cooper emerged from his capsule, saying, 
"I was just getting to the real fun part. . . . It was a very real simulation." 
Later that afternoon he went fishing, while checkout crews stayed at the pad, 
seeking out unsuspected trouble spots such as the diesel fuel pump.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-5.htm#source53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>That night Mercury Operations Director Williams broadcast the word: "All 
systems are go, and the weather is good. Let's pick up the count and go." Cooper 
lay down to sleep, confident that his safety and the mission would keep until he 
should awake and take his place.
<P>Next morning the countdown proceeded smoothly. Cooper had lain in the capsule 
only two and a half hours when he heard the final chant:
<P>"T minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Ignition. Liftoff."<A

us." Quoted in Allen J. Morrison, "NASA Official Warns of Inevitable Space 
Tragedy," <I>Salem</I> (Oreg.) <I>Statesman</I>, April 25, 1963.

introduced in a televised press conference on Sept. 17, 1962, were assigned 
specialty areas on Jan. 26, 1963, as follows: Neil A. Armstrong, trainers; Frank 
Borman, boosters; Charles Conrad, Jr., cockpit; James A. Lovell, Jr., recovery; 
James A. McDivitt, guidance; Elliot M. See, Jr., electronics; Thomas P. 
Stafford, communications; Edward H. White II, flight controls; and John W. 
Young, environmental control. For more details on other allusions in this

was written by Martin Caidin, dedicated to Tom Heinsheimer, and published by E. 
P. Dutton and Co., Inc., in February 1964 under the title <I>Marooned</I>. Much 
authentic flavor of Mercury flight operations may be gleaned from this fictional 
drama.
