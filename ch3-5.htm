<H1>Air Force Provides a Need</H1>The work of Eggers and others on designs for 
man-carrying space vehicles had been stimulated not only by general progress in 
long-range rocketry but also by the growing interest of the Air Force in manned 
space flight. Eggers knew that ever since the war the Air Force, through the 
Rand Corporation, had been considering the military potential of space 
technology, and that since early 1956 the service had been proceeding cautiously 
with contract feasibility studies of manned satellites.
<P>The impetus for these feasibility studies came from a staff meeting at the 
headquarters of the Air Research and Development Command ARDC at Baltimore, on 
February 15, 1956. During the course of the meeting, General Thomas S. Power, 
Commander of ARDC, expressed-impatience with the failure of his "idea men" to 
propose any advanced flight systems that could be undertaken after the X-15. 
Work should begin now, he declared, on two or three separate approaches beyond 
the X-15, including a vehicle that would operate outside the atmosphere without 
wings. He suggested that a manned ballistic rocket might be "eventually capable 
of useful intercontinental military and commercial transport and cargo 
operation." But the main benefit of having an advanced research project 
underway, Power pointed out, was that the Air Force could more easily acquire 
funds for the "general technical work needed."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
<P>Thus prodded into action, Power's staff quickly proposed two separate 
research projects. The first called for a "Manned Glide Rocket Research System" 
- a rocket-launched glider that would operate initially at an altitude of about 
400,000 feet and a speed of mach 21. The other, termed "Manned Ballistic Rocket 
Research System," would be a separable manned nose cone, or capsule, the final 
stage of an ICBM. Such a vehicle could lead to the "quick reaction delivery of 
[70] high priority logistics to any place on Earth," as suggested by Power, or 
to a manned satellite. Power's staff argued that the manned ballistic concept 
offered the greater promise, because the solution to the outstanding technical 
problems, the most critical of which was aerodynamic heating, would result from 
current ICBM research and development; because existing ICBMs would furnish the 
booster system, so that efforts could be concentrated on the capsule; and 
because the ballistic vehicle possibly could be developed by 1960. Either 
program, however, should be pushed rapidly so that the Air Force could protect 
its own interests in the field of space flight!<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>In March 1956, ARDC established two research projects, one for the glide 
rocket system, the other, known as Task 27544, for the manned ballistic capsule. 
ARDC planners shortly held briefings on the two proposed systems for its 
missile-oriented Western Development Division, in California, and for its 
pilot-oriented Wright Air Development Center, in Ohio. Other briefings were held 
for NACA representatives and for aircraft and missile contractors. Then, in 
October, Major George D. Colchagoff of Power's staff described the basic aspects 
of the two advanced systems to a classified session of the American Rocket 
Society's annual meeting in Los Angeles.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
<P>Since the Weapons Systems Plans Office of ARDC Headquarters never received 
the $200,000 it had requested for its own feasibility studies, the command had 
to content itself with encouraging privately financed contractor research.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source45"><SUP>45</SUP></A> 
In particular Avco, then trying to develop serviceable nose cones for the Thor 
and Atlas missiles, was urged to study the manned ballistic capsule. In November 
1956, Avco submitted to the Research and Development Command a preliminary study 
embodying its conclusions on the ballistic approach to manned space flight. ARDC 
still was short of funds, so Avco and other corporations continued to use their 
own money for further investigations.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>While ARDC promoted these systems studies and sponsored extensive research in 
human factors at the School of Aviation Medicine in Texas, at the Aeromedical 
Field Laboratory in New Mexico, and at the Aeromedical Laboratory in Ohio, it 
also sought to gain acceptance for its ideas within the Air Force organizational 
structure. On July 29, 1957, the Ad Hoc Committee of the Air Force Scientific 
Advisory Board, meeting at the Rand Corporation's offices in Santa Monica, 
California, heard presentations from the Ballistic Missile Division on ballistic 
missiles for Earth-orbital and lunar flights, and from ARDC Headquarters on the 
two advanced flight systems then under study. Brigadier General Don D. 
Flickinger, ARDC's Director of Human Factors, stated that from a medical 
standpoint sufficient knowledge and expertise already existed to support a 
manned space venture.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>Although the industrial firms investigated mainly the manned ballistic 
capsule, NACA, following the traditional approach of building up to higher and 
higher flight regimes, centered its efforts on the glide-rocket concept for most 
of 1957. Since late the previous year, when NACA had agreed in principle to an 
ARDC [71] invitation to cooperate on the Manned Glide Rocket Research System, as 
they were doing for the X-15, small teams of engineers at the Langley, Lewis, 
and Ames laboratories had carried on feasibility and design studies.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source48"><SUP>48</SUP></A> 
In January 1957 the Ames group reported its conclusions on a new rocket-powered 
vehicle for "efficient hypersonic flight," featuring a flat-top, round-bottom 
configuration. Interestingly enough, the Ames document contained as an appendix 
a minority report written by Langley aerodynamicists mostly from the Flight 
Research, Instrument Research, and Pilotless Aircraft Research Divisions - 
recommending that a nonlifting spherical capsule be considered for global flight 
before a glide rocket.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source49"><SUP>49</SUP></A> 
"The appendix was widely read and discussed at Langley at the time" recalled 
Hartley A. Soulé, a Langley senior engineer, "but there was little interest 
expressed in work on the proposal." He continued: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . . aside from the environment that limited the NACA mission to 
  terrestrial transportation, the proposal was criticized on technical grounds. 
  The report suggested that landings be made in the western half of the United 
  States, not a very small area. The spherical shape was suggested so that the 
  attitude would not be important during reentry. The shape was specifically 
  criticized because the weight of material to completely shield the surface 
  from the reentry heat would probably preclude the launching with programmed 
  ICBM boosters. Further, the lack of [body] orientation might result in harm to 
  the occupant during the deceleration period.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source50"><SUP>50</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>NACA 
study groups continued their investigations of manned glide rocket concepts 
through the spring and summer. In September 1957 a formal "Study of the 
Feasibility of a Hypersonic Research Airplane" appeared, bearing the imprimatur 
of the whole NACA but influenced primarily by Langley proponents of a 
raised-top, flat-bottom glider configuration.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>A few days later, on October 4, Sputnik I shot into orbit and forcibly opened 
the Space Age. The spectacular Russian achievement wrought a remarkable 
alteration in practically everyone's thinking about space exploration, 
especially about the need for a serious, concerted effort to achieve manned 
space flight. New urgency attended the opening of a long-planned NACA conference 
beginning October 15 at Ames, which was to bring together representatives from 
the various NACA laboratories in an effort to resolve the conflict in 
aerodynamic thinking between advocates of round and flat bottoms for the 
proposed hypervelocity glider. Termed the "Round Three Conference," the Ames 
meeting produced the fundamental concept for what would become the X-20 or 
Dyna-Soar for dynamic soaring project a delta-wing, flat-bottom, 
rocket-propelled glider capable of reaching a velocity of mach 17.5, almost 
13,000 miles per hour, and a peak altitude of perhaps 75 miles.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>Although they had been working mainly on the hypersonic glider, as requested 
by the Air Force, the research engineers of PARD, in tidewater Virginia, also 
had been speading more and more time thinking about how to transmute missile 
reentry bodies into machines for carrying man in low Earth orbit. Their 
advocacy, along with that of other Langley workers, of a spherical capsule early 
[72] that year had indicated their growing interest in making the quantum jump 
from hypersonic, upper- atmospheric, lift drag flight to orbital space flight in 
a nonlifting vehicle. At the Round Three Conference, Faget and Purser compared 
notes with Eggers, perhaps the leading hypervelocity theoretician in NACA. 
Eggers related his own conclusions: for orbital flight the design giving the 
highest proportion of payload to total weight was the compact, low lift drag 
vehicle, having little or no wings, and embodying Allen's blunt-nose principle. 
He discussed the analytical studies of his semiballistic M-1, which had some 
lift but would, he estimated, weigh from 4,000 to 7,500 pounds. Eggers cautioned 
his NACA colleagues that a nonlifting, or pure ballistic, vehicle might subject 
the passenger to excessive deceleration forces.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>Faget and Purser returned to Langley convinced that a maximum concentration 
of effort to achieve manned orbital flight as quickly as possible was 
imperative.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source54"><SUP>54</SUP></A> 
Obviously this meant that in the months ahead their research should focus on the 
ballistic-capsule approach to orbiting a man. Both the hypersonic glider, which 
called for progressing to ever higher speeds and altitudes, and Eggers' M-1, 
also too heavy for any existing booster system, would take too long to develop. 
The manned ballistic vehicle combined a maximum of simplicity and heat 
protection with a minimum weight and offered the best chance of getting a man 
into space in a hurry. Henceforth the aerodynamicists in PARD, and space 
enthusiasts in other units of the Langley laboratory, turned from NACA's 
historic preoccupation with winged, aerodynamically controllable vehicles and 
devoted themselves to the study of "a man in a can on an ICBM," as some in the 
Air Force called it.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-5.htm#source55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
<P>After Sputnik I, the aircraft and missile corporations also stepped up their 
research on the ballistic capsule; throughout November and December their design 
studies and proposals flowed into ARDC Headquarters. The most active of the 
firms considering how to put a man on a missile still was Avco. On November 20, 
1957, it submitted to ARDC its second and more detailed study of systems for 
manned space flight, entitled "Minimum Manned Satellite." The Avco document 
concluded that "a pure drag reentry vehicle is greatly superior in satisfying 
the overall system requirements," and that the best available rocket for 
boosting a manned satellite into an orbit about 127 miles from Earth was the 
Atlas. Still unproven, the Atlas was to make its first successful short-range 
flight (500 miles) on December 17, 1957. An Atlas-launched satellite, according 
to the Avco idea, would be a manned spherical capsule that would reenter the 
atmosphere on a stainless-steel-cloth parachute. Shaped like a shuttlecock, the 
parachute was supposed to brake the capsule through reentry. Then air pressure 
would expand the parachute to a diameter of 36 feet, and the capsule would land 
at a rate of 35 feet per second.
<P>Avco requested $500,000 to cover the expense of a three-month study and the 
construction of a "mockup," or full-scale model, of the capsule containing some 
of its internal systems. But because the Ballistic Missile Division was 
skeptical [73] about the drag-brake apparatus, and because ARDC was uncertain 
about Air Force plans in general, a contract was not awarded. Avco engineers, 
believing that the limiting factor in putting a man in orbit was not the capsule 
but the development of a reliable booster, focused on the Atlas and began 
holding discussions with representatives of Convair, builder of the Atlas.<A
