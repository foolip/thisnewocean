<H1>Awarding the Prime Contract</H1>During the first week in January, another 
group of men, led by Carl Schreiber at NASA Headquarters, evaluated the 
procurement aspects of the competitive proposals. This Management, Cost, and 
Production Assessment Committee was required to rank only eight companies, 
because four had been disqualified on purely technical grounds. By January 6, 
four companies were reported to the Source Selection Board as having outstanding 
management capabilities for the prime contract. But in the final analysis Abe 
Silverstein and the six members of his board had to decide between only two 
firms with substantially equal technical and managerial excellence: Grumman 
Aircraft Engineering Corporation and McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. The NASA 
Administrator himself eventually explained the principal reason for the final 
choice: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The reason for choosing McDonnell over Grumman was the fact that 
  Grumman was heavily loaded with Navy projects in the conceptual stage. It did 
  not appear wise to select Grumman in view of its relatively tight manpower 
  situation at the time, particularly since that situation might be reflected in 
  a slow start on the capsule project regardless of priority. Moreover, serious 
  disruption in scheduling Navy work might occur if the higher priority capsule 
  project were awarded to Grumman.<A

informed McDonnell on January 12 that it had been chosen the prime contractor 
for the Mercury spacecraft. Contract negotiations began immediately; after three 
more weeks of working out the legal and technical details, the stickiest of 
which was the fee, the corporation's founder and president, James S. McDonnell, 
Jr., signed on February 5, 1959, three originals of a contract.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-3.htm#source11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> 
This document provided for an estimated cost of $18,300,000 and a fee of 
$1,150,000. At the time, it was a small part of McDonnell's business and a 
modest outlay of government funds, but it officially set in motion what 
eventually became one of the largest technical mobilizations in American 
peacetime history. Some 4,000 suppliers, including 596 direct subcontractors 
from 25 states and over 1500 second-tier subcontractors, soon came in to assist 
in the supply of parts for the capsule alone.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-3.htm#source12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>The prime contract was incompletely entitled "Research and Development 
Contract for Designing and Furnishing Manned Satellite Capsule." The omission of 
an article before the word "manned" and the lack of the plural form for the word 
"capsule" prefigured what was to happen within the next five months. The 
original contract began evolving with the program, so that instead of 12 
capsules of identical design, as first specified, 20 spacecraft, each 
individually designed for a specific mission and each only superficially like 
the others, were produced by McDonnell. Contract change proposals, or "CCPs," as 
they were [138] known, quickly grew into supplemental agreements that were to 
overshadow the prime contract itself.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-3.htm#source13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>The relative roles of STG and McDonnell engineers in pushing the state of the 
art from design into construction are difficult to assess. Cross-fertilization 
of ideas and, after the contract was awarded, almost organically close teamwork 
in implementing them characterized the STG-McDonnell relationship. For a year 
before the company's selection as prime contractor, original design studies had 
been carried on with company funds. From a group of 12 engineers led by Raymond 
A. Pepping, Albert Utsch, Lawrence M. Weeks, and John F. Yardley in January 
1958, the Advanced Design section at McDonnell grew to about 40 people by the 
time the company submitted its proposal to NASA. The proposal itself stated that 
the company already had invested 32 man-years of effort in the design for a 
manned satellite, and the elaborate three-volume prospectus amply substantiated 
the claim.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-3.htm#source14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>In STG's 50-page set of final "Specifications for a Manned Space Capsule," 
drawn up in November, Faget and associates had described in remarkable detail 
their expectations of what the capsule and some 15 subsystems should be like. 
Now the McDonnell production engineers set about expanding the preliminary 
specifications, filling gaps in the basic design, preparing blueprints and 
specification control drawings, and retooling their factory for the translation 
of ideas into tangible hardware. Specification S-6 had enjoined the contractor 
to provide at his plant as soon as possible a mockup, or full-scale model made 
of plywood and cardboard, of the capsule system. With high expectations the Task 
Group awaited March 17, the date by which McDonnell had promised to have ready 
their detailed specifications and a dummy Mercury capsule and escape tower.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-3.htm#source15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> 
But the debut was not to be achieved easily.
<P>Before the company could finish building the mockup, at least two technical 
questions affecting the configuration had to be resolved: one was the type of 
heatshield to be used; the other was the exact design for the escape system. A 
third detail, the shape of the antenna canister and drogue chute housing atop 
the cylindrical afterbody, was also tentative when STG and McDonnell engineers 
began to work together officially on January 12, 1959.<A

Mercury," Jan. 12, 1959. Evidence that the earlier NASA capsule design continued 
to compete with the McDonnell configuration is found in studies of drogue 
parachute effectiveness in stabilizing the capsule at subsonic speeds. See memo, 
James S. Bowman, "Transmittal of Project Mercury Data to the Space Task Group," 
June 3, 1959. The precise shape of the "coolie hat" blast shield was still 
debated in late 1960. See letter, Purser to Walter F. Burke, "Progress Report on 
pylon jettison rockets test at NASA," Sept. 21, 1960.
