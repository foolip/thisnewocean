<H1>Shopping for the Boosters</H1>Booster procurement was perhaps the most 
critical, if not the highest priority task to be initiated. Once the Hobson's 
choice had been made to gear a manned satellite project to the unproven design 
capabilities of the Atlas ICBM, the corollary decision to use the most reliable 
of the older generation of ballistic missiles for testing purposes followed 
ineluctably. While the intercontinental-range Atlas was still being 
flight-tested, the medium-range Redstone was the only trustworthy booster rocket 
in the American arsenal. For suborbital tests, the intermediate-range Jupiter 
and Thor boosters were possible launch vehicles, but as yet they were neither 
capable of achieving orbital velocities nor operationally reliable.<A

<P>Even while the Joint Manned Satellite Panel was briefing the administrators 
of ARPA and NASA during the first week in October, Purser, Faget, North, and 
Samuel Batdorf flew to Huntsville for a business conference with the Army 
Ballistic Missile Agency regarding procurement of launch vehicles. Wernher von 
Braun's people assured their NASA visitors that Redstone missiles could be made 
available [123] on 12 to 14 months' notice and that the Army's Jupiters were far 
superior to the Thors of the Air Force. Although the Space Task Group had 
already consulted the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, at Inglewood, 
California, and was considering the Thor for intermediate launchings, a careful 
reconsideration of the adaptability of each weapon system as a launch vehicle 
for a manned capsule was now evidently required. The so-called "old reliable" 
Redstones might have been ordered right away. But the question of the need for 
intermediate qualification and training flights along ballistic trajectories was 
not yet settled.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-6.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> 
So more visitations to the Air Force and Army missile centers were arranged.
<P>STG's wager on the Atlas was formalized by an order to the Air Force, placed 
on December 8, 1958, for first one, then nine of these Convair-made 
liquid-fueled rockets. The Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, heretofore the 
only customer for the Atlas, agreed to supply one Atlas, a C-model, within six 
months and the rest, all standard D-models, as needed over a period of several 
years. Faget was pleasantly surprised to know an Atlas-C could be furnished so 
soon. Having placed its first and primary order with the Air Force, the Space 
Task Group went on to decide a month later to buy eight Redstones and two 
Jupiter boosters from the Army Ordnance Missile Command. The decision to procure 
both medium- and intermediate-range boosters from the same source hinged largely 
on the fact that the Jupiter was basically an advanced Redstone. Both were 
Army-managed and developed and Chrysler-built. To adopt the Thor would have 
required another orientation and familiarization program for NASA engineers.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-6.htm#source36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>Informed that the Atlas prime movers would cost approximately $2.5 million 
each and that even the Redstone would cost about $1million per launching, the 
managers of the manned satellite project recognized from the start that the 
numerous early test flights would have to be accomplished by a far less 
expensive booster system. In fact, as early as January 1958 Faget and Purser had 
worked out in considerable detail on paper how to cluster four of the solid-fuel 
Sergeant rockets, in standard use by PARD at Wallops Island, to boost a manned 
nose cone above the stratosphere. Faget's short-lived "High Ride" proposal had 
suffered from comparisons with "Project Adam" at that time, but in August 1958 
William Bland and Ronald Kolenkiewicz had returned to their preliminary designs 
for a cheap cluster of solid rockets to boost full-scale and full-weight model 
capsules above the atmosphere. As drop tests of boilerplate capsules provided 
new aerodynamic data on the dynamic stability of the configuration in free-fall, 
the need for comparable data quickly on the powered phase became apparent. So in 
October a team of Bland, Kolenkiewicz, Caldwell Johnson, Clarence T. Brown, and 
F. E. Mershon prepared new engineering layouts and estimates for the mechanical 
design of the booster structure and a suitable launcher.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-6.htm#source37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
<P>As the blueprints for this cluster of four rockets began to emerge from their 
drawing boards, the designers' nickname for their project gradually was adopted. 
[124] Since their first cross-section drawings showed four holes up, they called 
the project "Little Joe," from the crap-game throw of a double deuce on the 
dice. Although four smaller circles were added later to represent the addition 
of Recruit rocket motors, the original name stuck. The appearance on engineering 
drawings of the four large stabilizing fins protruding from its airframe also 
helped to perpetuate the name Little Joe had acquired.
<P>The primary purpose of this relatively small and simple booster system was to 
save money - by allowing numerous test flights to qualify various solutions to 
the myriad problems associated with the development of manned space flight, 
especially the problem of escaping from an explosion midway through takeoff. 
Capsule aerodynamics under actual reentry conditions was another primary 
concern. To gain this kind of experience as soon as possible, its designers had 
to keep the clustered booster simple in concept; it should use solid fuel and 
existing proven equipment whenever possible, and should be free of any 
electronic guidance and control systems.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-6.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>The designers made the Little Joe booster assembly to approximate the same 
performance that the Army's Redstone booster would have with the capsule 
payload. But in addition to being flexible enough to perform a variety of 
missions, Little Joe could be made for about one-fifth the basic cost of the 
Redstone, would have much lower operating costs, and could be developed and 
delivered with much less time and effort. And, unlike the larger launch 
vehicles, Little Joe could be shot from the existing facilities at Wallops 
Island. It still might even be used to carry a man some day.
<P>Twelve companies responded during November to the invitations for bids to 
construct the airframe of Little Joe. The technical evaluation of these 
proposals was carried on in much the same manner as for the spacecraft, except 
that Langley Research Center itself carried the bulk of the administrative load. 
H. H. Maxwell chaired the evaluation board, assisted by Roland D. English, 
Johnson, Mershon, and Bland of the Space Task Group. English later became 
Langley's Little Joe Project Engineer, Bland the STG Project Engineer, and 
Mershon the NASA representative at the airframe factory. The Missile Division of 
North American Aviation won the contract on December 29, 1958, and began work 
immediately at Downey, California, on its order for seven booster airframes and 
one mobile launcher.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-6.htm#source39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>The primary mission objectives for Little Joe as seen in late 1958 (in 
addition to studying the capsule dynamics at progressively higher altitudes) 
were to test the capsule escape system at maximum dynamic pressure, to qualify 
the parachute system, and to verify search and retrieval methods. But since each 
group of specialists at work on the project sought to acquire firm empirical 
data as soon as possible, more exact priorities had to be established. The first 
flights were to secure measurements of inflight and impact forces on the 
capsule; later flights were to measure critical parameters at the progressively 
higher altitudes [125] of 20,000, 250,000, and 500,000 feet. The minimum aims of 
each Little Joe shot could be supplemented from time to time with studies of 
noise levels, heat and pressure loads, heatshield separation, and the behavior 
of animal riders, so long as the measurements could be accomplished with minimum 
telemetry. Since all the capsules boosted by the Little Joe rockets were 
expected to be recovered, onboard recording techniques would also contribute to 
the simplicity of the system.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-6.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>Unique as the only booster system designed specifically and solely for manned 
capsule qualifications, Little Joe was also one of the pioneer operational 
launch vehicles using the rocket cluster principle. Since the four modified 
Sergeants (called either Castor or Pollux rockets, depending upon modification) 
and four supplemental Recruit rockets were arranged to fire in various 
sequences, the takeoff thrust varied greatly, but maximum design thrust was 
almost 230,000 pounds. Theoretically enough to lift a spacecraft of about 4,000 
pounds on a ballistic path over 100 miles high, the push of these clustered main 
engines should simulate the takeoff profile in the environment that the manned 
Atlas would experience. Furthermore, the additional powerful explosive pull of 
the tractor-rocket escape system could be demonstrated under the most severe 
takeoff conditions imaginable. The engineers who mothered Little Joe to maturity 
knew it was not much to look at, but they fondly hoped that their ungainly 
bastard would prove the legitimacy of most of the ballistic capsule design 
concepts, thereby earning its own honor.
<P>Although Little Joe was designed to match the altitude-reaching capability of 
the Redstone booster system, and thus to validate the concepts for suborbital 
ballistic flights, it could not begin to match the burnout speed at orbiting 
altitude given by the Atlas system. Valuable preliminary data on the especially 
critical accelerations from aborts at intermediate speeds could be duplicated, 
but Little Joe could lift the capsule only to 100 miles, not put it at that 
altitude with a velocity approaching 18,000 miles per hour. For this task, a 
great deal more, some sort of Big Joe was needed. A Jupiter booster might 
simulate fairly closely the worst reentry heating conditions but ultimately only 
the Atlas itself could suffice.
<P>Therefore, paralleling the planning of the Little Joe project at Langley, a 
counterpart test program was inaugurated by the Space Task Group with special 
assistance from the Lewis Research Center in Cleveland. Whereas Little Joe was a 
test booster conceived for many different demonstration flight tests, "Big Joe" 
was the name for a single test flight with a single overriding objective - to 
learn at the earliest practicable date what would happen when the 
"steel-balloon" rocket called Atlas powered a ballistic capsule on exit from 
Earth's atmosphere. Specifically, an experiment matching the velocity, angle of 
entry, time, and attitude at altitude for reentry from Earth orbit needed to be 
performed as soon and as exactly as possible by a powered ballistic test flight 
so that designs for thermal protection might be verified or modified. The Space 
Task Group [126] was most anxious about this; the whole manned satellite program 
was balanced tenuously on the stable thrust of the Atlas and the certain 
protection of the heatshield.
<P>Public concern over whether the Nation possessed an intercontinental missile 
was alleviated on November 28, 1958, when an Atlas first flew its designed range 
- more than 6,300 miles - down the Atlantic Missile Range toward Ascension 
Island. Three weeks later, on December 18, the Atlas scored again with a 
secretly prepared first launch into orbit of the entire Atlas vehicle (No. 10-B) 
as a communications relay satellite called "Project Score." Roy Johnson of ARPA 
claimed he was "sleeping more comfortably each night" after that.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-6.htm#source41"><SUP>4l</SUP></A> 
In the midst of these demonstrations of the power of the prototype Atlas, NASA 
Headquarters and the Space Task Group planned to launch the first Atlas test for 
the space flight program in June or July 1959.
<P>Gilruth appointed Aleck Bond, the former head of the Structural Dynamics 
Section at Langley, to take the reins as project engineer for Big Joe. Bond 
began to coordinate, with a real sense of urgency, the work of Langley and Lewis 
on the prototype capsule and of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division and 
Convair/Astronautics on the Atlas propulsion system. Two Big Joe shots were 
arranged initially, but the second was to be merely insurance against the 
failure of the first. Although the Lewis laboratory traditionally had been most 
closely associated with propulsion problems and therefore was the logical center 
for NASA's first experience with large launch vehicles, neither Lewis direction 
nor Lewis propulsion experts were directly involved. NASA simply did not have 
time to learn the intricacies of launching the Atlas itself. Rather, Lewis 
contributed the expertise to design the electronic instrumentation and the 
automatic stabilization and control system for the boilerplate capsules being 
built jointly by the Lewis and Langley shops.
<P>Bond recalled the initial rationale for Big Joe, alias the Atlas ablation 
test: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the time that the Big Joe flight test program was conceived, 
  only limited experimental flight test data existed on the behavior of 
  materials and the dynamics of bodies reentering the earth's atmosphere at high 
  speeds. These data, which evolved from the ballistic missile program, were 
  useful; however, they were not directly applicable to the manned satellite 
  reentry case because of the vast differences in the reentry environment 
  encountered and in the length of time the vehicles were subjected to the 
  environment. There was considerable concern regarding the nature of the 
  motions of a blunt body as it gradually penetrated the earth's atmosphere and 
  began to decelerate. Of similar concern was the lack of after-body heating 
  measurements and knowledge of integrity of ablation materials when exposed to 
  the relatively low level, long duration heat pulse which is characteristic of 
  the reentry of bodies with low ballistic parameters . . . entering the earth's 
  atmosphere at shallow entry angles.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-6.htm#source42"><SUP>42</SUP></A></ 
  blockquote> Although for Big Joe the Task Group could center its attention on 
  the capsule, whereas for Little Joe it had to develop the booster as well, the 
  design and [127] development problems for Big Joe still were sufficient to 
  cause slippage in the scheduled launch date from early to late summer in 1959. 
  To launch and recover the capsule safely would require very extensive 
  familiarization with new procedures. Central among the primary objectives for 
  Big Joe were the twin needs to determine the performance of the thermal 
  protection materials and to learn the flight dynamics of the spacecraft during 
  reentry. Many critical decisions for the project depended upon early, reliable 
  data on the heatshield, the afterbody radiative shingling, and the dynamic 
  stability of the "raindrop" configuration during the craft's trajectory back 
  through the atmosphere.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-6.htm#source43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
  <P>Also necessary were evaluations of the aerodynamic and thermodynamic loads 
  on the capsule all along its flight path and of the operation of its automatic 
  attitude control system. But certainly nothing was more important in the fall 
  of 1958 than the need to settle the technical controversy over the heat sink 
  versus ablation principles for the heatshield. Whether to use absorbing or 
  vaporizing materials to shield the astronaut from reentry heating was one of 
  the few major problems remaining to be solved when the manned satellite 
  project was established.
