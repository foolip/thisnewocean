<H1>Mercury Team Takes Shape</H1>Although Robert R. Gilruth's Space Task Group 
was growing rapidly, it remained small enough and intimate enough throughout 
1959 to make everyone feel his worth. The creative engineering challenge of the 
project inspired an esprit that could be measured by the amount of voluntary 
overtime and vacation time relinquished by the members of STG. Gilruth's 
administrative assistant for staff services, 46-year-old Paul D. Taylor, died of 
a heart attack in May and was mourned by his colleagues as a martyr who 
overworked himself in the cause.<A

<P>According to its own estimates of present and future manpower requirements, 
the Task Group was hard pressed to meet all its commitments in mid-1959. At the 
beginning of the new fiscal year on July 1, NASA authorized the Task Group to 
hire another 100 persons, mostly recent college graduates. A total of 488 
authorized positions was to be filled by the end of the calendar year. But STG 
argued that only one of its three major divisions at work on Mercury - 
Operations, under Charles W. Mathews - was fairly equal in numbers to the tasks 
at hand so far. The Flight Systems Division, under Maxime A. Faget, was called 
"greatly understaffed," and the Engineering and Contract Administration 
Division, now under the acting leadership of the Canadian James A. Chamberlin, 
was in "such urgent need" of more technical and administrative help that the 
Space Task Group requested 200 additional positions, to be filled within the 
next three months. Estimates of increased Langley and Lewis support activities 
for Project Mercury almost doubled this personnel request. The sheer size and 
immense scope of industrial and military personnel required to support Mercury 
stirred STG to a premonition of precarious control:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In summary, a detailed study of staffing requirements for Project 
  Mercury shows that the presently authorized complement of 388 should be 
  increased by 330 positions during fiscal year 1960 in order to maintain the 
  project schedules. This staff of 718 should be available by September of 1959, 
  but orderly recruitment and integration of the additional staff would defer 
  the filling of the complement until April of 1960. It is believed that 
  everything practicable in the line of contracting on Project Mercury has been 
  done without going to the extreme of effectively relinquishing control of the 
  project. Failure to obtain the additional personnel shown must result in 
  either major slippage of the schedule or in NASA effectively losing control of 
  the project to the military or to industry.<A

<P>Because there was still no official commitment to manned space flight 
programs beyond Mercury and because hope was still high that manned orbital 
flight could be accomplished by the end of 1960, the Task Group accepted its 
temporary status and planned to phase out the people working on Project Mercury 
beginning in June 1961. Such plans were tentative, of course, and did not reckon 
with the technical and organizational problems that were to stretch out the 
program, nor with the astronautical and political events that were to change the 
course and expand the role of NASA's manned space flight efforts in 1961.
<P>[170] Nevertheless, by early August 1959, Gilruth was able to put his own 
field element of the Goddard Space Flight Center in much better order through a 
major reorganization.<A

His new title, Director of Project Mercury, was indicative of the expanded size 
and activity of the Task Group. The functions of "project manager" for 
engineering administration devolved upon Chamberlin, who also headed the new 
Capsule Coordination Committee. Addition of staff services and elaboration of 
branch and section working group leaders after August 3 made STG's organization 
charts much more detailed. But the block diagrams, while helpful to new recruits 
and to industrial visitors at the crowded old brick administration building at 
the eastern entrance to Langley Field, showed rather artificial separations of 
activity and authority within STG. The intimacy of the original group had 
suffered inevitable attrition as the result of an eightfold increase in size in 
less than a year, but the "inner circle" still operated personally rather than 
formally. Outside relationships, even those with Langley Research Center, on the 
other side of the airbase, were rapidly demanding more formality.
<P>A partial solution to these problems, which in time grew to be one of the 
most important organizational decisions ever made for Project Mercury, was the 
informal agreement made in August 1959 between the Defense Department and NASA 
to select two men to act as "single points-of-contact." DOD appointed Major 
General Donald N. Yates, Commander of the Air Force Missile Test Center, to 
become in October its representative for military support activities for Project 
Mercury. The job of mobilizing and coordinating such diverse activities as Air 
Force prelaunch and launch support, Navy search and recovery operations, Army 
tracking and communications facilities, and joint service and bioastronautics 
resources demanded systematic, formal organization.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-2.htm#source6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> 
In turn, Hugh L. Dryden for NASA asked the chief of the High Speed Flight 
Station, Walter C. Williams, to join Gilruth to act as the contact point with 
Yates. Effective September 1, 1959, Williams and his colleagues Kenneth S. 
Kleinknecht and Martin A. Byrnes accepted transfers from NASA's High Speed 
Flight Station - shortly to be renamed the NASA Flight Research Center - to the 
Space Task Group. Having pioneered since 1945 in airborne launches of rocket 
research aircraft, Williams was a senior convert to the vertical ground launch 
cause of Mercury. Faget especially welcomed him. A personable and forceful 
leader, Williams took a position on a level with Charles J. Donlan. Each was an 
associate director for Project Mercury, Williams specializing in operations and 
Donlan in development. Williams had guided the NACA-NASA role in the flight 
operations of the X-15 rocket plane to a point just two days short of its first 
powered flight, on September 17, with North American Aviation's test pilot A. 
Scott Crossfield at the controls. When Williams, Kleinknecht, and Byrnes took up 
the higher national priority and professional challenge of working with 
spacecraft rather than aircraft, they brought to STG valuable operational and 
development experience with the highest-performance manned flight vehicles then 
in existence.<A

<P>[171] Although there was pressure to get on with operations planning, 
engineering the Mercury capsule was still the primary task during these days. 
McDonnell and STG had swapped permanent field representatives during the spring 
in the persons of Frank G. Morgan and Wilbur H. Gray. Morgan came to live in a 
motel at Langley. Gray found a residence in St. Louis near the north side of 
Lambert Field, where the McDonnell plant was spread around the perimeter of the 
municipal airport. Though their technical liaison work was heavy, Morgan and 
Gray acted as hosts and guides as much as consultants, because visits by 
exchange delegations of engineers were so frequent. Just as the coordination of 
these meetings and trips for the development of the capsule became imperative 
among the aircraft and spacecraft designers and developers, so were closer, more 
orderly relations required with the developers of the ballistic missile 
boosters. Aerospace engineers often used one word to express the adaptation of 
systems, modules, organizations, and even technologies to one another: that word 
was "interface"; it connoted problems of integration, convergence, and synthesis 
of indeterminate magnitude.
