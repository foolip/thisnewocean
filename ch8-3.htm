<H1>Suiting up for Space</H1>The pressure suit for Project Mercury was designed 
and first developed during 1959 as a compromise between the requirements for 
flexibility and adaptability. Learning to live and move within aluminum-coated 
nylon and rubber garments, pressurized at five pounds per square inch, was like 
trying to adapt to life within a pneumatic tire. Led by Walter M. Schirra, Jr., 
whose specialty assignment this was, the astronauts literally wrestled with the 
most elementary problem in becoming machine-rated - wearing the suit.
<P>Back in February 1959, Maxime Faget and Stanley White became convinced that 
the so-called "pressure" suits being used by Air Force and Navy test pilots were 
rather "high-pressure" and partially anti-g flying suits. Ever since 1947 the 
Air Force and the Navy, by mutual agreement, had specialized in developing 
partial-pressure and full-pressure flying suits, respectively, but a decade 
later neither type was quite satisfactory for the newest definition of extreme 
altitude protection. Such suits would require extensive modifications, 
particularly in their air circulation systems, to meet the needs of the Mercury 
space pilots. The first suit conference on January 29, 1959, attended by more 
than 40 experts in the art of tailoring for men engaged in high-altitude flying, 
had recommended an extensive evaluation program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> 
Through the spring three primary competitors - the David Clark Company of 
Worcester, Massachusetts (a prime supplier for Air Force pressure suits), the 
International Latex Corporation of Dover, Delaware (a bidder on a number of 
government contracts involving rubberized material), and the B. F. Goodrich 
Company of Akron, Ohio (suppliers of most of the pressure suits used by the 
Navy) - competed to provide by the first of June their best products for a 
series of evaluation tests.
<P>[230] NASA had requested the Air Force Aeromedical Laboratory at Wright Air 
Development Center and the Navy Air Crew Equipment Laboratory in Philadelphia to 
plan and perform evaluations of the different test suits before mid-July. The 
Clark and Goodrich suits ranked highest in both evaluation programs, but 
predictably the Air Force favored the Clark suit and the Navy the Goodrich suit. 
After an evaluation conference on July 15 at Langley, the chairman, Richard 
Johnston, informed all parties of STG's decision to work with both the Clark and 
the Goodrich companies for several more months to allow further concurrent 
development and evaluation of various combinations of suits and ventilation 
systems.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> 
By the end of August, William Augerson and Lee N. McMillion of STG recommended 
that "the suit should not be expected to cope with all the deficiencies of the 
Mercury capsule." The close interface between pressure suit and environmental 
control system caused enough problems to delay the formulation of suit 
specifications until October, but Goodrich was awarded the prime contract for 
the Mercury space suit on July 22, 1959.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
<P>One of the most senior employees of the Goodrich Company was Russell M. 
Colley. In 1933, Wiley Post returned from the first solo flight around the world 
and wanted some kind of rubber suit that would enable him to fly his famous 
aircraft <I>Winnie Mae</I> above the record 47,000-foot altitude. Colley had 
designed an aluminum helmet resembling those used by marine divers and had 
stitched together on his wife's sewing machine the first crude space suit. The 
next year Colley and his company had designed and developed a more flexible 
flying suit for Wiley Post, with an off-center face plate to accommodate Post's 
one-eyed vision. In 1952, Colley had designed and helped develop swivel joints 
of air-tight bearings and fluted fittings for pressure suits fabricated by 
Goodrich for the Naval Bureau of Aeronautics. In 1959, Colley, along with Carl 
F. Effler, D. Ewing, and other Goodrich employees, was instrumental in modifying 
the famous Navy Mark IV pressure suit for NASA's needs in orbital flight.
<P>Although the decision to let the capsule itself provide primary protection 
minimized the difference between corseted, pressurized g suits and a "space 
suit" for Project Mercury, the redundant suit environmental control system 
required complicated modifications and continual refittings.
<P>The Task Group had discovered during 1959 that each Mercury capsule would 
have to be specially tailored to its own mission objectives. Pressure suits also 
were designed individually according to use - some for training, others for 
evaluation and development. Thirteen operational research suits first were 
ordered to fit astronauts Schirra and Glenn, their flight surgeon Douglas, the 
twins Gilbert and Warren J. North, at McDonnell and NASA Headquarters, 
respectively, and other astronauts and engineers to be specified later. A second 
order of eight suits supposedly would represent the final configuration and 
provide adequate protection for all flight conditions in the Mercury program.
<P>The three major parts of the space suit - the torso coveralls, the helmet, 
and the gloves - were fabricated by techniques and procedures similar to those 
already [231] in use in the manufacture of full-pressure flying suits. But the 
air system operation was unusual: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Mercury headpiece is a single cavity design with suit 
  ventilation air exiting through the exhaust valve located in the right cheek 
  area. This system is known as the "closed" or "single gas" system and utilized 
  one air source for ventilation as well as breathing. This concept, which is 
  desirable in space missions, permits simplicity of design and minimum weight 
  of the ventilation and respiration equipment.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>According 
to Lee McMillion of STG's Life Systems Branch, the Big Joe reentry heating test 
in September 1959 allowed the developers of the pressure suit to remove much of 
the insulation previously thought necessary. This improved somewhat the mobility 
of the astronaut under full pressurization. By the end of the year McMillion, 
Colley, Schirra, and Glenn A. Shewmake, STG's "tailor," chose to modify the suit 
to facilitate mobility in the capsule rather than repattern for a more generally 
mobile suit. Schirra had felt many pressure points and was severely constricted 
in recent tests. His discomfort was traced to the design conservatism that had 
accepted the g suit and oxygen mask concepts used for the Navy Mark IV and Air 
Force X-15 flying suits. Furthermore, each time these prototype space suits were 
pressurized and worn, they stretched out of shape.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>Throughout the spring of 1960, fittings and tests with new textiles, 
different materials, and other human models continued until they finally solved 
the stretching problem. In mid-March a committee of eight members from STG, 
McDonnell, the Navy, and Goodrich decided on the final design features for the 
Mercury space suits. All kinds of minor troubles with zippers, the visor, the 
segmented shoulder, lacings, straps, snaps, seams, valves, underwear, gloves, 
microphones, and neck dams continued. But after a "gripe session" in mid-May 
1960, the astronauts and their tailors essentially agreed on what the 
well-dressed man should wear into space.<A

<P>During an orbital flight, certain physiological limitations were expected to 
establish the requirements for matching man and machine in one smoothly 
functioning system.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> 
In the area of noise and vibration, for example, research during the 1950s had 
led to the conclusion that 140 decibels, in the broad spectrum between 100 and 
12,000 cycles per second, was the most that man could stand for durations of 
four or five seconds. Acceleration tolerances were rising, thanks to knowledge 
gained by centrifuge and rocket sled tests, but above 6 g pilots could breathe 
only by forcing abdominal constriction and could move effectively only their 
hands and fingers. An oxygen pressure inside the lungs corresponding to that of 
100 millimeters of fluid mercury was judged necessary to preclude any symptom of 
hypoxia. To guard against the danger of "bends" (caisson disease or dysbarism), 
the cabin pressure should not be more than twice the suit emergency pressure of 
180 millimeters of mercury. No more than two percent of carbon dioxide by volume 
at sea level should be permitted.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> 
Other limitations, including extremes of temperature, humidity, radiation, and 
accumulating toxic [232] gases from carbon monoxide, ozone, metal, and plastic 
fumes, also became "human parameters." Warning instruments in the capsule relied 
primarily on stimulating the astronaut's senses of sight and sound; 
psychologists also studied the feasibility of using his senses of touch and 
smell to aid him in diagnosing malfunctions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>During the fifties academic and medical studies in sensory deprivation made 
an important, if indirect, contribution to the building of the spacecraft and 
the training of the astronauts. Made notorious by the experience of American 
prisoners of war who had been isolated and "brainwashed" in North Korean prison 
cells, the effects of isolation were attacked on many fronts. At McGill 
University, in Canada, at the University of Rochester in New York, and at the 
National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, famous sensory 
deprivation experiments reduced all physical stimuli to near zero. Suspending 
people in water of body temperature in blacked-out, soundproof rooms at Bethesda 
revealed that normal men, regardless of their motivations, could hardly stay 
both conscious and sane if deprived of all sensory stimuli beyond three hours. 
Physicians and psychiatrists were warning in 1956 and 1957 that 
<BLOCKQUOTE>if one is alone enough and at levels of human and physical 
  stimulation low enough, the human mind turns inward and projects outward its 
  own contents and processes. . . . Man's mental state is dependent on adequate 
  perceptual contact with the outside world. . . . Isolation produces an intense 
  desire for extrinsic sensory stimuli and bodily motion, increased 
  suggestibility, impairment of organized thinking, oppression and depression, 
  and in extreme cases, hallucinations, delusions, and confusion.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source23"><SUP>23</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Such 
background studies strengthened aeromedical demands, originating outside NASA 
and STG, for continuous communications between the ground and an orbiting man, 
for increasing the number of meaningful cues to be given the man in space, and 
for accenting significant tasks to be performed by the man inside the capsule. 
There was room for controversy here, but STG and NASA believed the hypothetical 
risks did not justify the very large outlay of money, men, and time that a 
continuous communication network would have required.
<P>If outside advice of this type was not always taken, there was still a 
conscious effort to solicit it. One of the most useful means of dialogue was the 
presenting of papers at meetings of professional societies. The size, lead time, 
and innovating nature of Project Mercury, together with the impetus from NASA's 
open information policy, all reinforced the normal professional obligation to 
inform and meet the judgment of one's colleagues. Thus it was that, on January 
25, 1960, several leading engineers from the Space Task Group were in New York 
for the annual meeting of the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences and presented 
papers reviewing the scope and recent results of their research and development 
program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> 
In one of these, Charles W. Mathews set forth the operational plans for the 
orbital mission. He did not mention the role of the pilot until the end [234] of 
his remarks. He then offered a summary list of eight activities to illustrate 
what the astronaut must be prepared to do: the Mercury pilot should communicate 
with ground stations, make scientific observations, monitor onboard equipment, 
control capsule attitude, navigate and fire retrorockets, initiate emergency 
procedures, activate escape system if necessary, and deploy landing parachute if 
required. Any one of these activities could conceivably save the mission.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
<P>The degree of control over his own destiny that the astronaut might have 
during the first orbital flights steadily increased throughout 1959 by virtue of 
the development of two new semi-automatic control systems: fly-by-wire, 
interposed in the automatic stabilization and control system (ASCS), and the 
rate command system (rate stabilization control system, or RSCS), superimposed 
on the manual proportional control system. Further elaboration and 
sophistication of the hardware took account of man's flexibility by providing 
for the use of more than one system at a time. In addition to the "last resort," 
or manual-proportional, method of attitude control, other uses of the astronaut 
as a source of mechanical power were being incorporated to the mutual advantage 
of reliability and flexibility. Turnkey handles and pull rings were added to 
duplicate virtually every automatic function of the mission sequence.
<P>In April 1960, Edward R. Jones, the chief psychologist at McDonnell, feeling 
that a vigorous defense is the best defense, argued in public that man in the 
Mercury capsule not only could act as an observer as well as the observed but 
should be considered an integral part of the system to increase the probability 
of mission success. Having just completed extensive studies of man's vision from 
the new centerline window, Jones supervised studies of other expected sensations 
during the Mercury orbital flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-3.htm#source26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> 
As the hardware and manned capsule systems tests progressed, Jones had more 
reason for his optimism about man's ability to perform effectively in space, 
once his life-support requirements were met. Concerning higher mental processes, 
Jones, speaking in a symposium at the Iowa Academy of Science, where James A. 
Van Allen represented the instrumentalists and John Paul Stapp represented the 
experimental physicians, maintained his positive approach: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most of the astronaut's tasks will involve complex mental activity 
  even though some may be on a near reflex level as a result of constant 
  practice. It is not expected that impairment of these functions will occur 
  under normal vehicle operation. Stress and an abnormal atmospheric 
  composition, if present, could cause some impairment of the higher mental 
  functions.
  <P>It should be apparent that the training of the astronaut in the operation 
  of the space vehicle will be critical. Much of the physiological training and 
  conditioning will be given on a part task basis in human centrifuges, and 
  pressure and heat chambers. The operation of the vehicle can be practiced over 
  and over again in a capsule simulator . . . built for Mercury. Overlearning 
  far beyond the point that apparent progress stops seems to be the best 
  guarantee that the astronaut will have developed response patterns that are 
  least apt to deteriorate under the stresses of orbital flight.<A

<P><A name=source20><SUP>20</SUP></A> Certainly the most delicate of all such 
interfaces for the first few leaps into space was that between the biosensors 
and human skins. The issue of the rectal thermometer designed into the suit was 
accepted for the moment as a necessary intrusion. See memo, Wheelwright to

<P>
<P><A name=source21><SUP>21</SUP></A> Suit pressure was maintained by a demand 
regulator that metered the oxygen into the system. If cabin pressure failed, the 
demand regulator sensed the pressure loss, sealed the suit, and maintained it at 
4.6 pounds. Should both systems fail - suit and cabin - there was an emergency 
oxygen valve that fed directly into the inlet hose at the waist junction. Before 
May 1961, the pressure suit had received 514 hours of manned testing.
<P>Oxygen was metered into the cabin by a regulator to maintain a minimum limit 
of 5.1 pounds. In designed operation, the cabin system remained at ambient 
pressure on the pad and up to 27,000 feet. At that altitude it sealed off at 5.5 
pounds. If there were a fire or a buildup of toxic gases, the astronaut could 
decompress the cabin manually, exhaust the toxic odors, and repressurize it. 
This system received 135 manned test hours at the Navy's Aviation Medical 
Acceleration Laboratory before May 3, 1961.
