<H2>Chapter XII<BR><BR>
Final Rehearsals</H2>
<P>[381] With the 1961 Labor Day holiday passed, the Space
Task Group buckled down to an exceptionally busy season, one that was to be
climaxed with STG's own demise and phoenix-like resurrection. Its activities had
become farflung. Dead ahead, at Cape Canaveral, loomed the first orbital flight
test of a Mercury capsule, carrying a true "black box," called a "crewman
simulator," instead of an astronaut. Then, too, plans long had been ripening for
a multi-orbital Mercury-Scout flight to qualify the ground tracking and
communications network. A second orbital flight carrying a chimpanzee in the
spacecraft couch also had an early place in the program.
<P>Meanwhile NASA agents had completed an extensive survey of potential sites
for the new development and operations installation for manned space projects of
the future. At its Langley Air Force Base domicile, STG was busy planning for
its expanding role in manned space exploration. Its personnel were weighing
persistent rumors that the new Manned Spacecraft Center might be located in
Texas, somewhere near the booming city of Houston.
<P>The first objective of all this simultaneous activity was Mercury-Atlas 4,
the fifth flight of an Atlas-launched spacecraft. This mission had been planned
and replanned many times before the unsuccessful launch of MA-3 back in April
1961, and the failure of that mission directly affected the MA-4 plans. During
the early months of 1960, MA-3 had been scheduled for a suborbital flight, with
a crewman simulator aboard. First plans called for the Atlas booster to be held
150 feet per second below orbital velocity, with capsule separation occurring at
the normal 100-mile-orbital-insertion altitude. Forty seconds after separation,
retrofire was to have produced a landing beyond the Canary Islands and about 100
miles short of the African coast. And when this test was completed successfully,
MA-4 was to repeat MA-3, but with a chimpanzee in the cockpit. Spacecraft No. 9
was to be specially fitted for the MA-4 flight.
<P>Toward the end of 1960, however, Walter C. Williams advised the commanding
officer of the recovery force, Destroyer Flotilla Four, that MA-4 would try for
three orbits with a crewman simulator aboard and that the targeted launch date
was April 1, 1961. But the MA-3 launch, still scheduled for a [382] suborbital
flight with its "mechanical astronaut," slipped to April 25. While many
Americans worried over the Soviet space coup represented by Yuri Gagarin's
one-orbit flight on April 12, Robert R. Gilruth and Williams already had made
the decision to change MA-3 to a one-orbit mission.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>April 25, 1961, came, but the day's recorded results were far from
heartening. The MA-3 launch vehicle failed to program over into the proper
trajectory; after 40 seconds of flight straight upward the Air Force range
safety officer destroyed the Atlas booster. So it was necessary on MA-4 to
strive for the same one-orbit objective and to delay still further the nominal
three-orbit Mercury mission.
<P>Meanwhile, for various reasons, production of the spacecraft and booster for
MA-4 fell behind schedule. Atlas No. 88-D, allotted for MA-4, did not receive
its factory rollout acceptance inspection until June 29&ndash;30, 1961, and it was
July 15 before it was delivered to Cape Canaveral. And spacecraft No. 9 was not
used, though originally planned. Instead No. 8 was fished from the Atlantic
after its ill-fated flight in MA-3 and shipped back to McDonnell in St. Louis on
April 27 for extensive overhauling. That meant cleaning, installing new
insulation, replacing the external portion of the hydrogen peroxide control
system, making spot-weld repairs in the large pressure bulkhead, and replacing
the heatshield, antenna canister, escape tower, tower clamp ring, adapter, main
clamp ring, and the inlet and outlet air snorkels. The overhauled spacecraft,
redesignated 8-A, was returned to the Cape, but G. Merritt Preston's crew still
had plenty of work. A leak had to be repaired in a reaction control system fuel
tank; the environmental control system and the automatic stabilization and
control system had to be reworked. A fairing to reduce launch vibration, like
the one used on the Little Joe 5-B flight on April 28, 1961, and similar to that
used on Virgil I. Grissom's suborbital mission in July, was added to the adapter
clamp ring.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<P>Because of all this modification and overhaul, it was August 3 before the
spacecraft for MA-4 was delivered to the pad and mated with the booster,
supposedly to be launched on August 22. The day before the scheduled flight the
Air Force's Space Systems Division in California called Cape Canaveral and
reported that solder balls had been found in some transistors of the same brand
that had been installed in the MA-4 booster. Coordination of this information
among the various Mercury-Atlas teams at the Cape brought to light the fact that
these types of transistors also had been used in the spacecraft. There was
nothing left to do but postpone the launch and give both vehicles a thorough
going-over to replace the defective transistors. On August 25 the spacecraft was
returned to Hangar S, when it became apparent that this work might encompass
several days. After these labors in the hangar, spacecraft 8-A was mated with
the booster again on September 1. This time the engineers conducting the
prelaunch checkouts found nothing wrong. Although 8-A was a secondhand capsule,
its landing bag had not been installed, it had ports instead [383] of the new
window, and the explosive egress hatch had been omitted, it still passed
inspection.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>Besides the problem with the defective transistors, the Mercury-Atlas booster
had been proceeding along the same tortuous route as the capsule toward flight
qualification. By September, the Atlas had undergone so many changes that had to
be integrated into launch vehicle No. 88-D, and experienced so many setbacks,
that a successful orbital mission was necessary for the sake of NASA and
national morale and to forestall any new attacks on the Atlas as the Mercury
launch vehicle. The year in which the Soviets had orbited a man now was in its
ninth month, yet the United States was still preparing to orbit a box full of
instruments. The Mercury-Atlas flight record had produced only one completely
successful launch - the MA-2 reentry heating test - out of four tries.
<P>This was scarcely an enviable record. Many hours, days, and months had been
spent by special committees and working groups in ferreting out the sources of
trouble. The STG, Space Technology Laboratories, Convair, and Air Force
engineers who had reviewed the failure of MA-1 had concluded that the forward
end of the Atlas was not designed to withstand the flight dynamic loads fed
through the adapter section, that the adapter was too flexible, and that
stiffeners were needed. MA-2 had confirmed the controversial "fix" of the
adapter section. MA-4 would be the second of the "thick-skin" Atlases. Reviewing
the MA-3 abort, the engineers assumed that the programmer's failure to pitch the
booster into a proper trajectory was due to a transient voltage. Also, some two
years previously, another anomaly caused the Big Joe Atlas to fail to stage, and
even in MA-2 there had been some propellant sloshing in the booster. To correct
the programmer problem, Convair modified the autopilot controls to give the
gimbaling engines of the Atlas a preventive counteraction capability. One
objective of MA-4, therefore, was to assess this innovation.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
In September the NASA-Air Force-contractor engineering team that had been beset
with Atlas problems for two years felt that the ICBM-turned-space-launcher was
ready to do its part in Project Mercury. In the words of Scott H. Simpkinson,
STG's liaison man at the Convair factory, "MA-4 just had to work."
<P>Not only would a successful orbital mission on MA-4 provide the necessary
data on the performance of systems and components, but the Mercury tracking
network crews and Department of Defense recovery forces would receive valuable
training for supporting a manned orbital circumnavigation by an American. Many
components, elements, procedures, and flight maneuvers had to be watched and
assessed before one of the "Mercury seven" could be committed to an orbital
mission around Earth.
<P>Of the manifold segments of an orbital flight, reentry was perhaps the most
critical. As it dropped back into the heavy atmosphere, the capsule would be
subjected to searing temperatures of about 2000 to 3000 degrees F for six or
seven minutes, or about eight times longer than on the previous Mercury
suborbital shots. Retrofire between Hawaii and Guaymas, Mexico, would bring
about a [384] gradual descent over the North American continent. About 345 miles
east of Savannah, the first contact with atmospheric resistance would begin, at
an altitude of 55 miles. At this point the appearance of the .05-g light on the
panel would telemeter a signal that reentry was coming up. Peak aerodynamic
heating would come when the spacecraft had descended to an altitude of 37 miles
and was traveling at 15,000 miles per hour. Braking would be dramatic. Between
46 and 12 miles high, traveling over a slant range of 460 miles, the capsule's
air speed would be reduced from about 17,000 to 1350 miles per hour.
Aerodynamic stresses in this region would provide a severe test of the
spacecraft's structural strength, particularly the heatshield and the afterbody
shingles.
<P>Perhaps the second most critical segment of the orbital mission would come
during the powered phase of the flight. The Space Task Group, supported by the
DOD and industry, would also monitor carefully the vibration levels to ascertain
if they would be tolerable for an astronaut. Even more important as the capsule
was rocketed toward orbit was a reliable escape system, to wrench the capsule
clear if the launch vehicle failed to perform. Also it was necessary to judge
the ability of the Atlas to release the spacecraft, to evaluate the abort
sensing and implementation system, to determine if the launch vehicle could
withstand the aerodynamic loads of max q, and to demonstrate the capability of
the Mercury network to perform its intended flight-control and data-collection
functions.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
If all went well, MA-4 would provide data proving the validity of years of
engineering calculations.
<P>MA-4 would be launched from complex 14 at the Cape on a true azimuth heading
of 72.51 degrees east of north. Following engine ignition, after being held to
the pad for three seconds to ensure smooth combustion, the Atlas booster engines
would propel the spacecraft within two minutes to a speed of about 6500 miles
per hour and an altitude of 35 miles over a downrange distance of 45 miles. The
sustainer engine would continue to burn. A gradual pitch program would begin to
tilt the Atlas toward the sea about 20 seconds after liftoff. Seconds after
booster engine cutoff (called "BECO" by the various Mercury-Atlas working teams
at the Cape), or at about 41 miles' altitude and a slant range of 56 miles from
the pad, the launch vehicle programmer would trigger a greater pitch-over
maneuver to put the Mercury-Atlas combination on a course parallel to Earth's
surface. At this time the escape tower would be jettisoned. After capsule
separation, orbital insertion would occur about 498 miles downrange from the pad
at an altitude of about 100 miles. The nominal inertial velocity at this point
was supposed to be 25,695 feet per second, increased to 25,719 feet per second
by the ignition of the posigrade rockets, which separated the spacecraft from
the booster. Within 50 seconds, the spacecraft should have drifted some 790 feet
from the booster. The Atlas, rather than falling away, would trail the orbiting
spacecraft around Earth at an altitude of about 100 miles, and should complete
each circle about once every 90 minutes for an estimated three days.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
<P>Instrumentation affixed to the spacecraft would provide data from nearly
[385] every conceivable point about the capsule. Noise levels in the vicinity
where an astronaut's head would rest would be measured and recorded on magnetic
tape. Excess vibration, a problem during early Mercury-Redstone flights, would
be monitored closely by seven strategically placed sensors, mostly in the area
where capsule and adapter joined. To determine what radiation dosages a pilot
would encounter, four standard and two special film packs would be carried. The
standard packs were placed on the sides and at the top and bottom of the couch.
Carrying a heavier emulsion, the two extra packs would measure the radiation
spectrum - the range of all kinds of radiation to which the capsule would be
exposed - as well as penetration levels. Flight data other than radiation would
be transmitted by two separate telemetry links, each providing essentially the
same information.
<P>The flight would be well covered photographically. Located on the left side
of the capsule cabin was the instrument panel camera, which would start
operating at liftoff, provide about 20,000 frames of panel information during
the mission, and cease five seconds after impact. Placed near the right-side
port, the Earth-sky camera was loaded for about 600 frames of pictorial data,
which would be exhausted somewhere over the Indian Ocean. A third camera,
affixed to the periscope, was loaded with about 10,000 frames of film for the
mission. This camera would provide especially useful information on the
spacecraft's orbital attitude reference to Earth at points where landmarks were
recognizable.
<P>Five recorders aboard the spacecraft would tape most of the mission data.
Three were seven-track systems to record all telemetry outputs, vibration
levels, noise, and shingle strain. The two others were single-track recorders,
to be operated in tandem and used to check the reliability of the tracking
network communications system.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
<P>Plans for spacecraft operations after the powered phase were essentially the
same as those for the suborbital flights, only on a much larger scale. Retrofire
was scheduled at 1 hour, 29 minutes, and 4 seconds after launch, with the three
rockets firing at five-second intervals in order: top-left, bottom, top-right.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
Recovery plans for orbital missions were considerably more complicated than they
had been for the suborbital flights, since many more contingency areas,
including abort and overshoot, had to be considered. Besides the nominal landing
area off the coast of Bermuda, five secondary landing areas were selected.
Providing that the launch was nominal and proceeded according to the preflight
calculated trajectory, the abort recovery areas were spaced as follows: Area A
began about 13 miles from the launch pad and continued along the track for 2200
miles. For the first 550 miles the coverage extended 30 miles to each side of
the track. This area covered the first 72 seconds after launch, or through
booster staging. The remainder of Area A, accounting for the period up to 298
seconds after launch, narrowed to about 15 miles on either side of the track.
Areas B and C were small elliptical blips on the track, 4 and 8 degrees of
longitude beyond A. These were designated for a possible abort at 298 or at 301
seconds, respectively. [386] The third contingency site, Area D, was a longer
ellipse (20 by 122 miles) beginning about 7 degrees of longitude past C. At this
point the "go/no go" flight decision would be made. The last, Area E, an ellipse
24 by 231 miles along the track, covered aborts up to 304 seconds after the
go/no go decision.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>The MA-4 capsule also was fitted with a number of aids to assist the DOD
forces in their recovery task. Two one-pound sofar bombs, one set to eject upon
main parachute deployment and the other set to detonate at 4000 feet of
hydrostatic pressure if the spacecraft sank, were carried. A flashing light with
a life of about 24 hours was set to activate upon impact. Fluorescein dye,
ejected at touchdown, would be visible for about six hours. Navy recovery forces
were asked to attempt the recovery of the drogue and main chutes and the
spacecraft antenna canister. Balsa wood blocks and Styrofoam had been attached
to these components for flotation.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
<P>As the launch date of the Mercury-Atlas 4 combination neared, weather
problems began to threaten this attempt to orbit a "mechanical astronaut." Not
one but two hurricanes thrashed the Mercury tracking areas. "Carla" raked the
Corpus Christi tracking station, while "Debbie" moved in a northerly direction
on the day before the launch, menacing and causing the ships to get rather a
"rough ride" in the prime recovery zone. The equipment at the Texas site
withstood the storm without damage. The STG-Air Force-Navy recovery planners at
the Cape felt that Weather Bureau support predictions had given them a
sufficient margin of safety in the Atlantic to allow the mission to proceed.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>

<H3>Mercury Orbits at Last</H3>On launch day, September 13, the cloud coverage
was scattered; visibility was 9 miles; the wind velocity was about 11 miles per
hour; and the temperature was 78 degrees. Ninety minutes before launch time a
half-hour hold was called to replace a broken screw in one of the afterbody
shingles. The liquid oxygen was loaded by 8:30 a.m., and 5 minutes later the
operations crew determined that all systems were go. At 8:57, however, the
low-speed data timing was momentarily lost at the Bermuda tracking site, and the
countdown was recycled to T minus 3 minutes and 30 seconds.
<P>A little after 9:04 a.m. on September 13, 1961, MA-4 was launched on its
one-orbit mission. During the first 20 seconds from liftoff, fairly severe
booster vibrations were detected by the flight dynamics officer in the Control
Center. The "thick-skin" Atlas passed its max-q test. At the 52-second point, a
spacecraft inverter that was converting electrical power from direct to
alternating current failed, but the standby inverter switched on automatically.
Guidance data soon disclosed that the trajectory was .75-degree high; later, at
engine cutoff, it was .14-degree low. Although booster engine cutoff occurred
2.5 seconds early, booster velocity was about 100 feet per second too high. Then
the sustainer engine cut off 10 seconds early, so the desired velocity was
essentially achieved. [387] Despite these dispersions, which were within design
limits, perigee and apogee of the orbit were only slightly more than a mile and
12 miles, respectively, below plan. The Goddard computers instantly indicated a
go for the mission. The powered phase, plus posigrade rocket increment, provided
a peak velocity of 25,705 feet per second; g loads during the powered phase
reached a peak of 7.6.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>Despite a slight disturbance in the roll, pitch, and yaw of the booster,
separation occurred properly, and after a 5-second steadying or damping period
the capsule began its turnaround maneuver. Soon, however, large attitude
excursions were observed, and the spacecraft took 50 seconds to reverse its ends
to heatshield forward, as opposed to a normal 20 seconds, using 9.5 pounds of
hydrogen peroxide attitude control fuel against the 2.2 pounds supposedly
required. Even with the abnormal turnaround, the spacecraft attitude gyros and
scanners soon transmitted nominal readings, and there seemed no doubt that the
mission would proceed to its orbital conclusion. The cause of these undue
excursions later was found to be an open electrical connection in the pitch-rate
gyro.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>A high oxygen usage rate like that on Grissom's suborbital mission cropped up
early and continued throughout the flight. At the 27,000-foot point the system
sealed off at 5.5 pounds per square inch; then an abrupt drop was indicated in
the primary oxygen supply and a concurrent rise in cabin and suit pressure
values to 6 pounds per square inch. "Primary oxygen going down fast," Paul E.
Purser jotted in his notes as he listened to the communications circuit.
"Zanzibar reported 30 percent of primary oxygen left," he later added. Toward
the end of the mission, with the primary supply depleted, the system switched
over to secondary. Usage from this source was so slight, however, that Walter
Williams, commenting on the high usage problem in a press conference following
the mission, said that the secondary supply was virtually untouched. Throughout
the flight the crewman simulator continued to use oxygen to produce moisture and
carbon dioxide, and to monitor the operations while recording heat and suit
pressure changes.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>Despite the abnormalities with the oxygen supply, once the automated Mercury
spacecraft was on its orbital course, the computers indicated that the mission
could go for more than seven orbits. In general, the control systems operated
well, although on three occasions the spacecraft dropped out of its 34-degree,
Earth-reference mode, once just before the ignition of the retrorockets and
twice just before the .05-g light telemetry signal. These attitude variations
came from the failure of a one-pound yaw-positive thruster and a one-pound
roll-negative thruster.
<P>Communications between the capsule and the tracking stations were good,
especially on high frequencies, which on the earlier suborbital flights had been
virtually unsuccessful. In some cases radar tracking was not good, largely
because a few of the operators lacked experience. Telemetry reception was
excellent, with some 137 observations received by the various tracking stations
during the flight.<A

<P>[389] One hour, 28 minutes, and 59 seconds after MA-4's liftoff, the first
retrorocket fired in the vicinity of Hawaii. Monitors at the Guaymas station in
Mexico indicated that retrofire, triggered by the spacecraft clock, had gone off
as planned. Within the range of the Cape Canaveral control center, telemetry
data disclosed that MA-4 was in the proper reentry attitude. Over the Atlantic
the drogue parachute opened at 41,750 feet, and the main chute deployed at
10,050 feet. At 10:55 a.m. the capsule splashed down 176 miles east of Bermuda.
After an hour and 22 minutes, the destroyer <I>Decatur</I>, which had been about
34 miles from the impact point, pulled alongside the spacecraft and hoisted it
aboard. From there the capsule and its robot "astronaut" rode to Bermuda, whence
they were airlifted to the Cape for an exhaustive examination.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
<P>The cause of the oxygen supply malfunction was immediately attacked by the
STG and McDonnell engineers. Onboard film, they found, disclosed that the oxygen
supply emergency light had blinked on, which would have signaled an astronaut to
take corrective action. The inspectors also learned that vibration had dislodged
the rate handle from its detent, allowing a valve to crack open. But the flow
rate had not been sufficient to trip the microswitch that would have given the
Mercury Control Center a telemetry indication of an emergency rate actuation
while the mission was in progress. Normally a force of from three to eight
pounds was needed to break the handle free from the detent, whereas in this case
the inspectors moved the handle with very little force. A new emergency rate
handle with a positive latching mechanism was to be devised for later
missions.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>Other postflight analyses by the engineers found the MA-4 spacecraft and its
systems in good condition. There was no afterbody shingle buckling or warping,
and the structural materials were only mildly discolored. The horizon scanner
window was partially coated with a film of oxidized material caused by
aerodynamic heating. Some internal debris, including solder balls and washers,
had apparently escaped preflight tumbling and vacuum cleaning. Six buckled skin
panels between the base ring and the lower pressure bulkhead indicated that the
capsule landed with the heatshield edge striking the water first. Still the
inspectors concluded that the structural damage was not enough to have
endangered an astronaut. The center section of the heatshield was partially
delaminated and the center plug was loose, conditions apparently caused by water
impact and cooling. Two cracks were found on the shield in the vicinity of the
water-impact point. The depth of the char on the ablation shield was very
shallow.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>NASA officials showed their pleasure at the success of MA-4 at the press
conference held at the Cape immediately after the flight. Gilruth pointed out
that this had been the hardest test flight in the whole NASA program. He added
that the Atlas had demonstrated that it was capable of boosting a man into
orbit, as he, Maxime A. Faget, Purser, and others from NACA-Langley days had
long believed. Without hesitation Gilruth concluded that a man would have
survived the flight.
<P>[390] At that point a reporter asked whether a man would fly the next Mercury
orbital mission. Walter Williams answered that a three-orbit circuit, either
unmanned or carrying a chimpanzee, was still necessary. Then why was the
upcoming Mercury-Scout mission necessary, asked a newsman. Again Williams
affirmed his confidence in the wisdom of the agreed-upon schedule of flights.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>

<H3>Space Task Group Gets a New Home and Name</H3>Between flight planning and
scheduling launches in August 1961, a NASA site survey team headed by John F.
Parsons, Associate Director of Ames Research Center, had inspected a number of
sites competing for the permanent location of a center for manned space flight
projects. The new center had been approved in principle by President Kennedy in
accordance with his strategic decision, endorsed by the Congress, to accelerate
the space program. The team appraised the sites on 10 points, briefly stated as
follows: availability of educational institutions and other facilities for
advanced scientific study, electric power and other utilities, water supply,
climate, housing, acreage, proximity to varied industrial enterprises, water
transportation, air transportation, and local cultural and recreational
resources. On September 19, 1961, NASA Administrator James E. Webb announced
that the new Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) would be established on a 1000-acre
tract to be transferred to the Government by Rice University, near Houston. The
site was in Harris County, Texas, on the edge of Clear Lake, an inlet of
Galveston Bay on the Gulf of Mexico.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>Webb maintained that selection of the Houston site had been influenced by
[391] recent decisions to expand the launch complex at the Atlantic Missile
Range and to establish a fabrication facility for large booster and space
vehicle stages at the Michoud Plant, near New Orleans, where torpedo boats had
been manufactured during World War II. The Manned Spacecraft Center, the Michoud
Operations, and the Cape Canaveral complex would become a vast integrated
enterprise coordinating the development, manufacture, and operation of the
manned space flight program.
<P>Not unexpectedly, there was some criticism of the Texas site chosen for the
new development center. Charges of inordinate political influence involved the
names of Vice-President Johnson, a Texan and chairman of the National
Aeronautics and Space Council, and Democratic Representative Albert Thomas of
Houston, Chairman of the House of Representatives Independent Offices
Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. NASA spokesmen categorically
denied that there had been any improper influence. Particularly crestfallen were
the citizens of the Virginia peninsula, who realized they were losing some of
the activities at the Langley Research Center and the Wallops Station. All
through August, September, and October, the dailies of Newport News echoed this
disappointment. To Houston, of course, this was "wonderful news," as the Chamber
of Commerce proclaimed, and local business leaders dispatched representatives to
brief the transferring NASA employees in Virginia on the advantages of the Texas
coast.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>Less than a month after Webb's announcement, a Houston journalist went on an
inspection tour of the site planned for the spacecraft center. He found cowboys
driving herds of cattle to new pasture, a crew of surveyors from the Army Corps
of Engineers mapping the prairie near Clear Lake and fighting snakes, and a lone
wolf hunter with the carcass of a freshly slain wolf. The hunter said he had
just seen several wild turkeys, a fox, and many deer tracks.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>[392] Gilruth and other officials of the Space Task Group reacted quickly to
the Webb announcement. The very next day they flew into Houston to begin a
search for an estimated 100,000 square feet of temporary floor space. Moving
began in October 1961, when Martin A. Byrnes, as the local manager, and a small
cadre of center operations, procurement, and personnel employees opened offices
in Houston's Gulfgate Shopping City. By mid-1962, when the move was completed,
activities were scattered in 11 locations, occupying 295,996 square feet of
leased office and laboratory space in the vicinity of Telephone Road and the
Gulf Freeway. For both old and new employees, a street map was a necessity in
the coordination of information among the various offices located in the
dispersed buildings. Besides the leased quarters, NASA personnel liberally used
surplus facilities available at nearby Ellington Air Force Base.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
<P>By early October 1961, the Space Task Group had established an information
relocation center in its Public Affairs Office to help personnel facing the
move. Inquiries from the employees about schools and housing were numerous.
Shortly thereafter, members of the Space Task Group received procedure
directions for permanent change of duty station and then were advised on
November 1, 1961, that "the Space Task Group is officially redesignated the
Manned Spacecraft Center." The center was now a de facto NASA unit, a nerve
center of the accelerated manned space flight program. It was several months,
however, before the administration of projects was subdivided for management of
the three major programs - Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. NASA outlined its
building requirements for the center on October 13, 1961, at which time two
plans were under consideration, one with 13 major buildings and the other with
14, to accommodate 3151 people. The estimated cost was $60 million for the
first year's construction.<A

<H3>Wires Get Crossed: Mercury-Scout I</H3>Despite the flurry of activity at
Hampton, Virginia, Houston, and elsewhere, generated by the impending move, STG
did not pause in its scheduled Mercury flight test program. Plans had been in
progress for several months and by the summer of 1961 were well developed for
Mercury-Scout, whose flight was to provide a dynamic checkout of the Mercury
tracking network.
<P>Early in May, Purser and Williams of STG, Charles J. Donlan, who had returned
to the Langley Research Center rolls in April, and Warren J. North of NASA
Headquarters had met to discuss how the Mercury tracking network, completed at
the end of March, could be exercised and evaluated. They agreed that the
four-stage, solid-propellant Scout, originally designed at Langley and popularly
called the "poor man's rocket," could perform this task economically. North
briefed Abe Silverstein, NASA Director of Space Flight Programs, when he
returned to Washington from Langley. In the meantime, William E. Stoney of STG
had inquired of the Air Force, which also used the Scout, about the [393]
availability of a Scout launch vehicle. The planners proposed to use the Air
Force and its contractors for payload design and construction and for vehicle
assembly and launch. On May 11, Air Force officials replied that a Scout was
available, but concurrently North reported that Silverstein was not interested
in a Scout shot. Purser, relaying this information on to Gilruth, remarked that
"you or Williams will have to talk to him [Silverstein] about it." Mercury-Scout
mission planning, meanwhile, was already in progress, and Marion R. Franklin of
STG was temporarily appointed as project engineer. This responsibility took on
the aspects of a revolving door, with the assignment being shuffled among
several Task Group engineers. James T. Rose was named to head the project a few
days later; then Rose and Lewis R. Fisher had co-responsibility, until Rose was
relieved to continue his work with James A. Chamberlin on what became the Gemini
two-man spacecraft project proposals.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
<P>Although Silverstein at Headquarters opposed such a test, those on the
operations end of Mercury felt that a flight to train the operators and check
the tracking stations was a necessity. On May 15, 1961, personnel of NASA
Headquarters and several of its cognizant centers, including Harry J. Goett of
Goddard, Williams and Purser of Space Task Group, Low from NASA Headquarters,
and Thomas A. Harris, G. Barry Graves, and Paul Vavra from Langley, met to
review the proposed Scout launch in view of Silverstein's reluctance. They still
concluded that the Scout was the best booster for network checkout purposes. The
problem was how to sell the idea to Silverstein.
<P>Low and Graves saw Silverstein the next day. They told him that only a
one-orbit flight, possibly carrying a chimpanzee, was scheduled for the next six
months; moreover, the Air Force had a spare research and development Blue Scout
booster. This readiness gave promise of a reasonably early launch date, which
was necessary if the communications exercise were to be worthwhile. Silverstein
tentatively acquiesced, but he demanded assurance that all the design problems,
including payload and antennas, would be resolved before he gave final
Headquarters approval. After that approval, he added, all effort should be made
to meet an August 15, 1961, firing date.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
This stipulation apparently was made so that the flight would precede the
scheduled August 22 launch date of the MA-4 one-orbit flight.
<P>With Silverstein's reluctant blessing, the planners wasted no time in getting
the Scout enterprise rolling. At a meeting at Langley on May 17, attended by
Williams, Purser, Merritt Preston, Franklin, and Chamberlin of STG; North of
NASA Headquarters; and Graves, Virgil F. Gardner, and Elmer J. Wolff of Langley,
responsibilities were assigned and some general requirements were outlined. As
noted, Rose and Fisher were named project engineers. Rose was in Los Angeles
discussing boosters for the two-man project at the time. He received a call from
Chamberlin requesting him to go to Aeronutronic in Newport Beach, California, to
talk about instrumentation for the payload. He was joined there by Earl Patton,
communications expert from McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. [394] Graves asked
the Goddard Space Flight Center to supply minitrack equipment and Goddard
tentatively agreed to do so. The purpose of the minitrack equipment (used in the
instrumented satellite programs) was to furnish data for comparison with that
which would be transmitted by Mercury instrumentation. Mercury instrumentation
was to include C- and S-band beacons, telemetry carriers, and either a command
channel on the minitrack or a receiver operated by a command transmitter. Graves
also planned to arrange with Goddard for minitrack drawings, and Chamberlin
volunteered to contact McDonnell for the Mercury instrumentation drawings and
hardware components. Some thought was briefly given to the possibility of using
the Langley Research Center to instrument the payload; otherwise the Ford Motor
Company's Aeronutronic Division, Air Force contractor for the Scout, probably
would provide the instrumentation.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
<P>On May 23, North in Washington telephoned Purser at Langley and reported that
Silverstein "had bought the Scout." There was a qualification, however: planning
could proceed, but money was not to be committed until Robert C. Seamans, Jr.,
NASA's "general manager," approved. Silverstein immediately sought Seamans'
concurrence, offering the inducement that only the payload would require NASA
funding ($130,000); the Air Force, using the operation to provide experience for
its launch crews, would bear the cost of the launch vehicle and launch.
Silverstein argued to Seamans that delays in the Mercury-Atlas program, with a
reduction of the flights to be conducted before a manned orbital mission, made
using the Scout to check out the network seem sensible. The proposed payload, he
said, would be prepared by Ford Aeronutronic, using components from Mercury
capsule No. 14, which had already flown in the Little Joe 5-B test of April 28,
1961. The STG planners estimated that the earliest possible launch date was
sometime in July, but Silverstein told Seamans that an August date seemed more
realistic. Seamans agreed and returned the formal STG request on May 26, stamped
"approved."<A
href="notes.htm#n12.28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>Now that the blessing was official, the Space Task Group made a sustained
effort to launch in July. In June STG engineers considered the components that
were to make up the 150-pound payload. Since Associate Administrator Seamans at
NASA Headquarters had suggested in his approval document that a backup launch
vehicle be obtained, STG secured the Air Force SSD's commitment to supply a
second four-stage Scout. Seamans' suggestion proved to be prophetic; although no
second Mercury-Scout mission was ever launched, the backup fourth stage had to
be used in the first attempt.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<P>By early July, the trajectory data and mission directive for Mercury-Scout
were completed. MS-1 would be launched at the Cape from complex No. 18-B,
formerly the Project Vanguard launching site, on a true azimuth heading of 72.2
degrees east of north, aiming at an apogee of about 400 miles and a perigee of
about 232 miles. Orbital insertion of the payload was to occur some 1100 miles
from the Cape, at a speed of 25,458 feet per second and an altitude of 232
miles. [395] A small rectangular box held the payload, which consisted of a C-
and S-band beacon, two minitrack beacons, two command receivers, and two
telemetry transmitters, all with antennas; a 1500 watt-hour battery; and the
fourth-stage instrumentation package. The payload equipment was to function for
18&frac12; hours in orbit. To conserve electrical power while in flight, the
equipment would be turned off by a ground command after the first three orbits.
During shutdown, the results would be analyzed, and the equipment would then be
activated to make another three-orbit data collection. The planners felt that by
repeating the shutdown and reactivation operation they could obtain data
equivalent to three full missions, gather a wealth of information for
comparison, and give the DOD and NASA trackers a good workout.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
<P>The launch vehicle for the mission was a 70-foot, solid-propellant Scout
rocket weighing 36,863 pounds at liftoff. The booster had four stages. Starting
from the bottom, these included an Aerojet Algol engine with a steel case and
steel nozzle, burning polyurethane fuel and guided by hydraulic exhaust vanes; a
Thiokol Castor motor, also with steel case and nozzle, burning a
polybutadiene-acrylic acid propellant, with a precision autopilot employing
hydrogen peroxide reaction motors; an Allegheny Ballistic Laboratories Antares
motor encased in filament-wound fiber impregnated with epoxy resin, propelled by
nitrocellulose nitroglycerin, and guided by an autopilot identical to that in
the Castor; and an Allegheny Altair engine of the same construction as stage 3,
using the same propellant, but with a spin-stabilizing control mechanism.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>The Scout was erected on the pad on July 25 to await mating with the payload.
Ford Aeronutronic had completed what turned out to be the initial packaging and
had shipped the payload to the Cape on July 3. There the equipment underwent
spin-ballast and operational checks and was mated with the booster. But trouble
with faulty solid-state telemetry transmitters, developing during the pad
checkout, caused such a delay that a July launching became impossible. At about
that same time NASA Headquarters decided that the payload had not had sufficient
vibration testing, so it was shipped to Aeronutronic at Newport Beach,
California, for testing and repackaging. After it returned to the Cape,
malfunctions appeared in the Scout's fourth stage, and the Cape engineers had to
lift the fourth stage from the backup vehicle. The question in August was which
would be ready first, the launch vehicle or the payload. Then on September 13,
MA-4, carrying its mechanical astronaut, essentially preempted the Mercury-Scout
by its orbital trek around Earth. The Scout payload reached the Cape on
September 20, but all four Scout stages did not return to the pad until October
22. The anticlimactic Scout launch was supposed to take place on the 31st.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
<P>On Halloween, 1961, a launch crew under the technical supervision of the Air
Force launch director (who, in turn, was responsible to the NASA operations
director) attempted the Mercury-Scout launch. The countdown proceeded well down
to the moment of ignition - when nothing whatever happened. The [397] ignition
circuits were rechecked and repaired and the next day, November 1, 1961,
Mercury-Scout took off. Immediately after liftoff, the vehicle developed erratic
motions, and after 28 seconds the booster began tearing apart. The range safety
officer gave the destruct signal 43 seconds after launch. The failure, it was
later determined, resulted simply from a personal error by a technician who had
transposed the connectors between the pitch and yaw rate gyros, so that yaw rate
error signals were transmitted to pitch control, and vice versa.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
Six months of plans and labors had disintegrated in less than a minute.
<P>Ambitions for a second Mercury-Scout, such as had been advocated earlier by
Seamans, collided with the reality that another Scout rocket would not be ready
before a Mercury-Atlas launch afforded a satisfactory and complete
ground-tracking network checkout. The first stage of the backup Scout rocket
failed its inspection tests, while the fourth stage had been used on the
ill-fated Mercury-Scout 1 mission. Besides, Mercury-Atlas 5 was scheduled to go
in mid-November, and the first manned orbital mission was set for December 19.
Consequently, Low recommended the cancellation of the Mercury-Scout program to
D. Brainerd Holmes, who had taken on manned space flight duties in NASA
Headquarters.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
So the Scout had a short but chaotic life as a member of the Mercury family of
launch vehicles.

<H3>Man or Chimpanzee for MA-5?</H3>From its unseemly beginning embodied in the
Mercury-Scout failure on the first day of its formal existence, the newly titled
Manned Spacecraft Center would go on in November to direct and record a
resounding success, Mercury-Atlas 5. A curious atmosphere surrounded the
approaching animal orbital mission, a sense of impatience, as though the Nation
wanted to see it done quickly so the program could hurry forward to a manned
orbital shot. The press clearly deplored any slip in MA-5 that would delay the
manned flight. Putting an American into orbit before the end of 1961 was
popularly regarded as something sorely needed for national prestige. NASA
officials obviously were influenced by these pressures, and rank-and-filers in
the space program were like members of a football team committed to a warmup
game before a conference classic.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>Some NASA leaders flatly opposed the chimpanzee flight. Administrator Webb's
office questioned MSC on the need for another unmanned Mercury mission in view
of the successful orbital flights of Cosmonauts Gagarin and Titov. A Washington
newsman suggested that the President's advisers feared another American animal
flight would only invite Soviet ridicule. Paul P. Haney, a public-affairs
spokesman at NASA Headquarters, finally cleared the air when he announced to the
public, "The men in charge of Project Mercury have insisted on orbiting the
chimpanzee as a necessary preliminary checkout of the entire Mercury program
before risking a human astronaut."<A
href="notes.htm#n12.36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>Other space-related events soon distracted public attention from the [398]
impending primate voyage on MA-5. One was the perfect launching of the mammoth
Saturn I on its maiden flight. On the morning of October 27, the 163-foot-tall
vehicle, with its 1.3 million pounds of thrust, rocketed 215 miles into space.
The flight immediately triggered public discussion of whether a super-Saturn
might be selected for launching the lunar mission spacecraft.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
In Houston, the Manned Spacecraft Center, site for the direction of manned space
projects of the future, captured the imagination of local citizens. A space-age
tradition was born when H. T. Christman, a procurement officer, became the first
member of the organization to buy a home in the Houston area, which was located
in the Timber Cove residential development that was to become the neighborhood
of several Mercury astronauts, near the site of the to-be-constructed Spacecraft
Center.
<P>Preparation for MA-5, initiated many months previously, continued without
much fanfare. As early as January 1961, notes on the status of hardware for this
mission had begun to appear in STG's quarterly progress reports to NASA
Headquarters. Both booster and spacecraft then were being manufactured and
tested. On February 24, spacecraft No. 9 had arrived at the Cape to begin a
40-week preflight preparation. This lengthy period, longest in the Mercury
project, derived from the various flight program changes that required
corresponding configuration changes. No. 9 had been configured initially for a
ballistic instrumented flight, then for a ballistic primate flight, next for a
three-orbit instrumented mission, and finally for a three-orbit chimpanzee
flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>Another factor contributing to the long preparatory period was that the data
obtained from the MA-4 mission demanded a number of modifications. For the
environmental control system, a locking device was added to the oxygen emergency
rate handle, while the inverters, one of which had failed during MA-4, were put
through a severe vibration-test program. Since some unbonding had occurred on
the heatshield of the MA-4 spacecraft, x-rays twice were made of the ablative
layer to determine the soundness of the glue line. For the explosive side egress
hatch, as yet untried on an orbital mission, thermocouples were added and a
limit switch was installed to signal any premature hatch firing, an experience
that cost the loss of a flight-tested spacecraft in MR-4. And the horizon
scanner sensor system was modified to avoid the erroneous signals transmitted
during the orbit of the "mechanical man."<A
href="notes.htm#n12.39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>Thus the spacecraft mounted on Atlas No. 93-D for MA-5 differed considerably
from that used on the September orbital flight. This was another reason Haney
had said that "the men in charge of Project Mercury" wanted another qualifying
round before a manned mission. Besides modifications already described, No. 9
had a landing bag installed and a large viewing window. Although the window had
been used on MR-4 and had proved useful to Astronaut Grissom, it had not been
subjected to the much greater reentry heat the MA-5 capsule would encounter.
Aside from these new components, No. 9 had about the same equipment as carried
in MA-4 - tape recorders for [399] gathering data and exercising the
communications network, cameras, and radiation film packs. Of course, "Enos,"
the chimpanzee eventually selected from the colony in training, would need no
simulator to do his breathing or perspiring. He had his own metal-plastic
pressure couch, which was connected to the suit circuit of the environmental
control system.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>The spacecraft operated in a fashion similar to the first orbital Mercury
vehicle. Once again, as during MA-4, the hydrogen peroxide fuel supplies for the
automatic and manual control systems were linked to provide a common reservoir.
The automatic stabilization and control and rate stabilization control systems
would be operated separately, so that the performance of each could be
evaluated. The automatic system was programmed to exercise capsule attitude
control until one minute after the .05-g light signal; then the rate system
would take over for reentry, providing a constant-roll rate of about 7.5 degrees
per second as well as damping motions in the yaw and pitch axes. The rate system
would switch off at main parachute deployment.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
<P>Recovery aids and operations, too, were about the same as for MA-4, including
radar chaff, sofar bombs, a flashing light, and dye marker. The probable launch
abort recovery areas were spaced and designated as before, although there were
more contingency recovery areas because the mission was longer. For each of the
three planned orbits about five contingency locations were selected. During the
second orbit, for example, the emergency landing areas included the Atlantic
Ocean near the west coast of Africa, the Indian Ocean near the east coast of
Africa, the Indian Ocean near the west coast of Australia, and the Pacific Ocean
either 440 miles southeast of Hawaii or 165 miles southwest of San Diego. The
primary recovery zone shifted following the completion of each full orbit.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
<P>Space Task Group officials expected delivery of the MA-5 launch vehicle,
Atlas No. 93-D, about mid-August 1961, but it was decided by STG and the Air
Force to delay shipment until the flight of MA-4. Then, when faulty transistors
had delayed the MA-4 launch, intensive quality assurance inspections of the
transistors had to be initiated. The electronic gear of the rocket was also
modified, its 100-watt telemetry system was replaced by a 3-watt transistorized
unit, and the autopilot circuitry was altered to alleviate the high vibrations
experienced during the first orbital Mercury flight. These changes dragged the
delivery date back to October 9, 1961. In Washington, George Low warned Seamans
that the time needed to secure several components necessary for these
modifications might affect the delivery date of Atlas No. 109-D, the booster
scheduled to launch the first astronaut into orbit. No. 93-D was the third
"thick skin" Atlas booster, employing a heavier gauge of metal in its forward
tank.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>According to plans, which now were to approximate those for the manned
orbital mission as nearly as possible, MA-5 would rise from complex 14 at Cape
Canaveral on a heading 72.51 degrees east of north. Orbital insertion of the
[400] spacecraft should occur about 480 miles from the Cape at an altitude of
100 miles and at a speed of about 25,695 feet per second. Retrofire to initiate
entry into the atmosphere was planned for 4 hours, 32 minutes, and 26 seconds
after launch. Twenty-one minutes and 49 seconds later the spacecraft should hit
the water in the Atlantic. Estimated temperatures during reentry should be about
3000 degrees F on the heatshield, 2000 degrees on the antenna housing, 1080
degrees on the cylindrical section, and 1260 degrees on the conical section.
The STG operation planners estimated that the spent Atlas sustainer engine would
reenter the atmosphere after 9&frac13; orbits, a considerable change from their
estimates for the descent of the MA-4 rocket.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>

<H3>Training Primates and Men</H3>For the all-important task of checking out the
environmental control system on a long-duration flight, a chimpanzee was chosen
to "stand in" for man. As in the preparation for Ham's suborbital mission on
MR-2, two colonies of chimps traveled to the Cape about three weeks before the
flight date. Again the military handlers from Holloman Air Force Base separated
the colonies to prevent cross-infection. Training involved restraining the
animals in a pressurized flight couch, with biosensors attached to their bodies
at various points. And psychomotor training that had been started in New Mexico
was continued at the Cape so that the animals' proficiency would not
deteriorate.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
<P>On October 29, 1961, three chimps and 12 medical specialists moved into their
Cape quarters to join two other simians and eight persons already in flight
preparation status. The name given to "Enos," the animal selected as the flight
test subject, in Greek or Hebrew means "man," and the training and flight
performance recorded by this chimpanzee proved the sobriquet to be well chosen.
Captain Jerry Fineg, chief veterinarian for the mission, described Enos as
"quite a cool guy and not the performing type at all." This "immigrant" from the
French Cameroons had none of the tendencies of his circus-trained counterparts.
Enos' backup "pilots," listed in order of their flight readiness ability, were
"Duane," named for Duane Mitch, a veterinarian; "Jim," named for Major James
Cook, of the same profession; "Rocky," named for a well-known pugilist
(Graziano) because of his cauliflowered ear and pugnacious spirit; and "Ham," the
astrochimp veteran. The ratings were made by Fineg and another Air Force
officer, Marvin Grunzke. Fineg later learned that when these same chimps had
gone through their earlier launch and reentry training on the centrifuge at the
University of Southern California, they had been rated in the same order.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>The psychomotor equipment used by Enos on the MA-5 mission was more
complicated than that operated by Ham during the Mercury-Redstone 2 suborbital
flight. Housed in the cover of his pressurized couch, Enos' package was rigged
to present a four-problem cycle. The first would last for about 12 minutes, and
the second followed six minutes of rest. The routine would proceed until the
[401] cycle was completed, then the four problems would be repeated until the
mission ended. Problem one would offer right- and left-hand levers that Enos
could use to turn off lights, avoiding a mild shock in the left foot (the same
as for Ham). The second problem planned was a delayed-response experiment.
Twenty seconds after a green light would appear on the panel, Enos would have to
press a lever to receive a drink of water. Although there would be no penalty
for his failure to respond, if the chimpanzee should pull the lever too early
the problem would simply recycle and he would receive nothing. The third, a
fixed-ratio problem, would involve pulling a lever exactly 50 times to receive a
banana pellet. This would also be voluntary and without penalty. Chimpanzee
intelligence would be tested in the fourth. Three symbols - circles, triangles,
and squares - would appear in various two-of-a-kind combinations, with the task
being to pull a lever under the odd symbol to avoid a mild shock. Lack of
response during rest periods would give the indication that the animal was well
oriented to his spacecraft environment.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>Planning for this second trial of the Mercury worldwide tracking network was
elaborate. Supporting the MA-5 mission were 18 stations, plus the Goddard Space
Flight Center and the Mercury Control Center. Goddard and the Control Center
furnished computer support and management of the overall operation,
respectively.

<H3>Chimpanzee into Orbit</H3>By mid-October, reported George Low to NASA
Headquarters, problems with capsule No. 9 and booster No. 93-D had forced STG to
delay the launch from November 7 to November 14. On November 11, however, after
the preflight checkout crew found a hydrogen peroxide leak in the fuel line of
the capsule manual control system, the earliest possible launch date slipped to
November 29.<A

The count stopped at T minus 390 minutes, to be resumed the next day. Some 11
hours before the launch, Enos, the 39-pound chimpanzee, underwent his final
physical examination, stood still as his medical sensors were taped on, allowed
himself to be secured in the specially constructed primate couch, and rode in
the transfer van to the gantry. About 5 hours before launch the couch [403] was
inserted in the spacecraft. Thereafter Enos' condition was monitored by lines
connected to his couch in the Mercury capsule and by radio telemetry. He was
relaxed during countdown. His temperature ranged from 97.8 to 98.4 degrees,
normal for the suit inlet temperature of about 65 degrees; his respiration
averaged 14; and his pulse rate was 94. The only time Enos displayed agitation
was when he was roused by the opening of the hatch during a countdown hold
caused by a telemetry link failure at T minus 30 minutes. The gantry was hauled
back to the spacecraft, the hatch was opened, and an off-and-on switch was
correctly positioned. This hold lasted 85 minutes. Some members in the control
center joked that Enos had turned the switch off because he had talked to Ham
and did not want to go.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>In the Mercury Control Center the flight control monitors had manned their
stations and were busily checking out their consoles. Tecwyn Roberts, serving as
flight dynamics officer, noted the intermittent problems cropping up in the
data-gathering and translating computers. A faulty transistor in the direct data
receiver caused one hold, and when the replacement was also faulty, several more
minutes were lost in repairing the computer. Morton Schler, the capsule
environment monitor, reported that the environmental control system was working
smoothly. The Freon flow rate, he reported, leveled at a comfortable 20 pounds
per hour in the prelaunch period. From the oxygen partial-pressure transducer
some erratic readings proved erroneous; Mercury Control teletyped the tracking
stations to discount these readings as the spacecraft passed over.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>Holds during the countdown amounted to almost 2 hours and 38 minutes. Shortly
after the hatch was bolted at T minus 90 minutes, the technicians discovered
that they had failed to install some hatch cover heat insulation material. They
took a little more than an hour to correct this oversight. Then, at T minus 30
minutes, the discovery of an improperly positioned switch necessitated the
85-minute hatch-opening hold. And finally, at T minus 15 minutes, a 4-minute
hold was called to correct a data-link problem between Mercury Control and the
General Electric ground command guidance equipment.
<P>Walter Williams, the mission director, listened as the various difficulties
arose and became somewhat agitated at the chain of events. Although his usual
position during such times was at a console in the mission control center, he
left the building and quickly drove the distance to pad 14 to personally express
his expectations that things would proceed in a more orderly manner. As a member
of Convair later said, "Williams was a master in imparting a need for orderly
urgency."
<P>Despite these holds, weather conditions remained favorable. Only a few thin
cirrus clouds hung in the sky, visibility was 10 miles, and the surface wind
velocity was at a moderate 11 miles per hour from the northwest. In the landing
area the weather was even better.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
<P>The Goddard computers received the liftoff signal 13 seconds before the
booster actually rose from the pad, an error apparently caused by feedback
between two recorders. Nor was this the last incorrect signal. [404] The Goddard
computers registered sustainer engine cutoff twice before that event happened,
once shortly after liftoff and again two minutes after launch. In each case the
Mercury Control Center had to switch to override the signal until the panel
indicator cleared.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
Liftoff came at 10:08 a.m. The powered phase of the flight went well, although
there were minor discrepancies. Between liftoff and staging, the horizon-scanner
signal was lost briefly. All spacecraft systems nevertheless appeared to be
working normally, with the guidance system of the Atlas keeping the booster on
an almost perfect insertion trajectory. Guidance system noise was only about
half that recorded during MA-4, and vehicular vibration also was much lower.
Four and a half minutes after launch, Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., unhesitatingly
made the go-for-orbit decision. At sustainer engine cutoff, the velocity, flight
angle, and altitude were nearly perfect. The Atlas hurled the spacecraft into an
orbit with a perigee of about 99 miles and an apogee of 147 miles, .5 and 5.4
miles low, respectively.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
<P>Spacecraft and booster separation occurred precisely as planned, while the
turnaround maneuver took less than 30 seconds. The capsule's position excursions
were very slight, which contrasted sharply with the erratic turnaround of MA-4.
The spacecraft quickly dropped into its 34-degree orbit mode and began streaking
over the oceans and continents. Of the 61.5 pounds of control fuel aboard,
turnaround and damping had consumed 6 pounds, as opposed to 9.5 for MA-4. From
that point and on through the first orbit the thrusters used only 1.5 pounds to
maintain a correct position, with the automatic stabilization and control system
functioning perfectly.
<P>The environmental control system and the tracking and communications network
performed in a satisfactory fashion. On this mission, for the first time, the
primary and secondary oxygen bottles were pressurized at 7500 pounds per square
inch (the design specification) rather than at 3000, as on previous flights. A
functioning water separator also was used for the first time. Each tracking
station's range on the ultra-high-frequency band lasted for about six minutes;
on high frequency, overlap communications between stations were similar to that
experienced during MA-4. The Goddard computers received valid telemetry data
from all stations except Woomera, but there were instances when communications
were momentarily lost at particular stations. Just before retrofire, for
example, Point Arguello, the site giving the firing command, lost contact with
the Cape. In each instance, as Walter Williams would point out at the postflight
press conference, communications were reestablished whenever that particular
station was needed.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
<P>Enos, the orbiting chimpanzee, fared well. He withstood a peak of 6.8 g
during booster-engine acceleration and 7.6 g with the rush of the sustainer
engine. He had been performing his lever-pulling duties for some two minutes
before the Atlas roared and rose from the pad. During his two orbits he made 29
pulls (divided among four sessions) on the continuous-avoidance and
discrete-avoidance levers, receiving only one shock in each category. On his
second problem, which [405] required at least a 20-second delayed response to
receive a drink of water, his average delay was about 33.8 seconds. For these
labors he was rewarded with a total of 47 measures of water, or about a pint
during the three-hour mission. For the fixed-ratio task, problem three, Enos
pumped his lever and received 13 banana pellets during his four opportunities.
On the first session of problem Four, Enos was correct for 18 out of 28 symbol
presentations (64.2 percent), thus receiving 10 shocks as a result of his
miscues. On the second session of problem four, however, the center lever
malfunctioned, causing shocks even if he pulled the correct lever. He received
36 and 43 successive shocks on the third and fourth sessions, respectively,
because a manmade device had failed. The shocked and frustrated chimpanzee
nevertheless kept pulling the levers. As he was also trained to do, Enos
remained at rest during the six-minute intervals between problems.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
<P>Near the end of the first orbit, the tracking monitors noted that the capsule
clock was about 18 seconds too fast and as it passed over the Cape a corrective
command was dispatched to and accepted by the clock. At that time the Mercury
Control Center display panels indicated that all spacecraft systems were in good
order. Suddenly the Atlantic tracking ship reported that inverter temperatures
were rising. The Canary Island trackers confirmed the environmental control
system malfunction. Since abnormal heating had occurred on earlier flights and
the inverters had continued working or had switched to standby, there was no
alarm among members at Mercury Control. Then, across the world from the Cape,
Muchea, Australia, detected high thruster signals and capsule motion excursions,
although other data indicated that the 34-degree orbit mode was being
maintained. The Woomera, Australia, tracking station failed to confirm this
report, and it was discounted.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
<P>By the time the MA-5 capsule reached the vicinity of the Canton Island
station, the operations team realized that the attitude control system was
allowing the vehicle to go out of its proper orbital mode. A metal chip in a
fuel supply line (the postflight inspection would reveal) had cut off the
propellant flow to one of the clockwise roll thrusters. This inactive thruster
allowed the spacecraft to drift minus 30 degrees from its normal attitude, at
which point the automatic stabilization and control system brought the
spacecraft to zero in a normal roll-turn maneuver. Then the spacecraft swung
briefly back into the nominal 34-degree orbital attitude, and the sequence
started again. The spacecraft repeated this process of drift and correction nine
times before retrofire and once more between retrofire and the receipt of the
.05-g light telemetry signal. The still-active thrusters used about 9.5 pounds
of control fuel working to keep the capsule properly aligned. Each loss of orbit
mode cost a little over a pound of fuel compared with a first-orbit expenditure
of only 1.5 pounds.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
<P>The cooling equipment in the environmental control system also began to give
trouble during the second orbit. Between the Canary Islands and Kano, the suit
circuit temperature rose rapidly from 65 to 80 degrees, indicating a freezing
condition in the heat exchanger. As water in the felt evaporator pad of the
[406] exchanger turned to ice, Enos' body temperature climbed to 99, then to 100
degrees. The medical observers began to worry, especially about the chimp's
ability to handle his psychomotor test problems. Then, at 100.5 degrees, his
body temperature appeared to stabilize, suggesting that the environmental system
was ceasing to overheat. Their fears relieved, the physicians felt that the
mission could continue. Although the cooling system had seemed to correct
itself, Kraft, the flight director, later remarked that a deicing unit should be
added to warm the troublesome unit, which had also caused a freeze-up on MA-4.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
Although the medical monitors were willing to allow the mission to proceed
through its scheduled third pass around the world, the operations team believed
that the problem of the spacecraft's erratic attitude was too grave to live
with. The engineers felt that there simply was not enough attitude fuel left to
complete the circuit and then go through the reentry phase, in which, even under
normal circumstances, fuel usage would be high.
<P>After the attitude aberrations were first noted, Kraft had alerted the
tracking unit in Hawaii for a possible clock change to initiate retrofire during
the second orbit. Then he decided to continue the flight toward California and
notified Gordon Cooper at Point Arguello that that station might have to
initiate a ground command for retrofire. Meanwhile, the capsule continued to
drift and swing in and out of the orbital mode, demonstrating that the attitude
control system, unlike the environmental control system, would not solve its own
problems. Twelve seconds before the retrofire point was reached for the normal
second-orbit primary recovery point, Kraft decided to bring Enos back to Earth.
Arnold Aldrich, MSC's chief flight controller at Point Arguello, correctly
executed the command.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
<P>With the exception of the one repeated variation in attitude position, caused
by the dead roll thruster, reentry went according to plan. The destroyers
<I>Stormes</I> and <I>Compton</I> and a P5M airplane began preparing for
spacecraft retrieval in Station 8, the predicted impact point. Three hours and
13 minutes after launch and about nine minutes from water impact, the P5M
spotted the descending spacecraft at an altitude of about 5000 feet and radioed
the <I>Stormes</I> and the <I>Compton</I>, 30 miles away. All spacecraft
recovery aids except the sarah beacon functioned properly. During the
spacecraft's descent, the airplane circled and reported landing events, then
remained in the area until the <I>Stormes</I> arrived, an hour and 15 minutes
after the landing, and hauled Enos and his spacecraft aboard. Shortly thereafter
the hatch was explosively released from outside the capsule by a pull on its
lanyard, causing the chimp's "picture" window to crack.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
<P>Aboard the <I>Stormes</I> and later at Cape Canaveral, Manned Spacecraft
Center and McDonnell engineers gave the capsule the usual close scrutiny and
happily found that it had held up well. Except for a slight discoloration caused
by aerodynamic heating, the exterior showed no buckling or warping. The interior
was in good shape, too, although the inspectors did find a small amount of salt
water. Activation of the explosive hatch caused minor damage in the form [407]
of the cracked window, several bolts pulled from the skin, and a slight buckle.
Thermodynamic effects on the ablation heatshield had produced several radial and
circular cracks, none of which had been severe enough to threaten the capsule's
structural integrity. The center plug of the heatshield was missing (it had only
worked loose on MA-4), but close inspection of the opening showed that the plug
had evidently been in place during reentry. Condition of the impact bag, which
had survived its first orbital test, was fairly good, although several straps
were broken and others were severely bent. Again the plastic bulkhead was
pierced, probably by the heatshield, and the honeycomb material was crushed in
several places. There was no damage to the tubing or wiring in this area.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>
<P>At the Cape postflight press conference the leaders of Project Mercury
revealed no regrets over missing a third orbit. They seemed to regard the
reprogramming operation, conducted in the middle of the mission, as a satisfying
technical accomplishment. In view of the decisiveness with which the various
potentially critical difficulties had been overcome or circumvented, MA-5 had to
be termed an excellent operation, one that had achieved most of its objectives
and that would become a milestone on the road into the unknown.
<P>Enos had been weightless for 181 minutes and had performed his psychomotor
duties with aplomb. Operations director Williams felt that an astronaut riding
in the MA-5 spacecraft could have made the necessary corrections in flight to
complete the three-orbit mission normally. On the spacecraft attitude control
problem, for example, a man could simply have switched from automatic to manual
mode, he said. At the same time, Williams was pleased that the automatic systems
had worked well for over two hours. Equally significant, the vast network of
NASA, military, and industry personnel had performed like veterans during the
emergency. The spacecraft had reentered and landed without handing the Navy any
unexpected recovery problems.

<H3>Now a Man in Orbit?</H3>
<P>The press corps at the usual postflight press conference listened courteously
to this technical postmortem, but their main concern was whether another test
mission would be flown before a manned orbital flight. Williams and Gilruth
cautiously replied that first the MA-5 data would have to be thoroughly
evaluated. Then the reporters wanted to know who had been selected to make
Mercury's first manned orbital flight. Gilruth was ready for that one; he
announced the team members for the next two missions. John H. Glenn was the
selected prime pilot for the first mission, with M. Scott Carpenter as his
backup. Donald K. Slayton and Walter M. Schirra were pilot and backup,
respectively, for the second mission.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.65"><SUP>65</SUP></A>
This announcement represented a considerable change from the tighter news policy
regarding crew selection that had prevailed in suborbital days.
<P>Meanwhile Enos had his moment. After the urbane anthropoid came [408] aboard
the <I>Stormes</I>, he ate two oranges and two apples, his first fresh food
since he had gone on a low-residue pellet diet. The destroyer dropped Enos at
the Kindley Air Force Base hospital in Bermuda, where Jerry Fineg took over. The
chimp was walked in the corridors and appeared to be in good shape. His body
temperature was 97.6 degrees; his respiratory rate was 16; and his pulse was
100. Apparently reentry, reaching a peak of 7.8 g, had not hurt him. His
composure at his "press conference" surprised the correspondents. One reporter
remarked that Enos, unlike Ham, did not become "unhinged" with the popping of
the flash bulbs. On December 1, Enos reached the Cape for another round of
physicals, and a week later he departed for his home station at Holloman, and
well-deserved retirement.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.66"><SUP>66</SUP></A>

<DIV class="figure" id="fig408">
<IMG src="t408.gif" alt="Cartoon drawing of Enos and Ham walking away after Enos' orbital flight, saying: We're a Little Behind the Russians and A Little Ahead of the Americans">

flights" to the space race was offered by cartoonist John Fischetti of the
Newspaper Enterprise Association.</P>
</DIV>

<P>Enos' fame was short-lived. Public attention now turned to the supposedly
imminent American manned orbital flight, although there still was no assurance
that a spacecraft would next carry a man. Speculation mounted when Atlas 109-D
was hauled into the Cape on the night of November 30. Newsmen immediately
gathered around B. G. MacNabb, the Convair preparation chief, to ask when the
checkout would start. "Tomorrow," he replied. When asked if there would be a
crash effort in order to make the flight in 1961, [409] Williams said that three
shifts were working a 168-hour week (all the hours possible), and that no
special pressure would be applied. None of these statements dampened speculation
by the press early in December. Signs, rumors, and portents cropped up daily.
One correspondent, for example, noted that John Glenn had moved into special
quarters at the Cape, adding that NASA had requested Atlantic Missile Range
support beginning on December 20 and continuing to year's end.<A
href="notes.htm#n12.67"><SUP>67</SUP></A>
<P>If NASA had ever been involved in a drive to put an American in orbit in the
year of the Vostoks, that effort halted on December 7, the 20th anniversary of
the Pearl Harbor attack. Almost casually Gilruth and Williams announced that the
flight was now scheduled for early 1962. The decision, said MSC officials, had
been influenced by "minor problems dealing with the cooling system and
positioning devices in the Mercury capsule." The official press release did
state that NASA considered the spacecraft, its systems, and the tracking network
qualified for manned flight. It had been apparent to many NASA officials for
some time that the manned orbital launch might have to be postponed until 1962.
George Low, at NASA Headquarters, had recognized the probability soon after
mid-October, when he wrote, "The pad conversion time between MA-5 and MA-6 is
exceedingly short if MA-6 is to remain on schedule." On schedule meant December
19.
<P>Hugh L. Dryden summed up his philosophy regarding adherence to schedules for
manned flight when he said, "You like to have a man go with everything just as
near perfect as possible. This business is risky. You can't avoid this, but you
can take all the precautions you know about."<A
href="notes.htm#n12.68"><SUP>68</SUP></A>
<P>Although there was regret that this country did not get a man into orbit
before the Soviets, or at least in the same year, 1961 had recorded substantial
progress toward making the United States a spacefaring nation. In contrast with
the atmosphere of uneasiness marking the end of 1960, the Manned Spacecraft
Center engineers now knew that they were on the brink on fulfilling Project
Mercury's basic objectives. The rehearsals were over.
