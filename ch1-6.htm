<H1>Sputniks and Soul-Searching</H1>[28] On August 26, 1957, Tass, the official 
Soviet news agency, announced that the U.S.S.R. had successfully launched over 
its full design range a "super long distance intercontinental multistage 
ballistic rocket," probably a vehicle employing the improved V-2, the T-l, as an 
upper stage and a booster rocket with a thrust of over 400,000 pounds the T-3.<A

In the furor in the West following the Russian announcement an American general 
allegedly exclaimed, "We captured the wrong Germans."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source83"><SUP>83</SUP></A>
<P>Then, on October 4, the Soviets used apparently the same ICBM to blast into 
orbit the first artificial Earth satellite, a bundle of instruments weighing 
about 184 pounds called <I>Sputnik,</I> a combination of words meaning 
"fellow-traveler of the Earth." A month later Soviet scientists and rocket 
engineers sent into high elliptical orbit a heavily instrumented capsule, 
<I>Sputnik II,</I> weighing some 1120 pounds and carrying a dog named Laika.
<P>The Russian ICBM shot in August had given new urgency to the missile 
competition and had prompted journalists to begin talking about the "missile 
gap." The Sputnik launches of the fall opened up a new phase of the 
Soviet-American technological and ideological struggle, and caused more chagrin, 
consternation, and indignant soul-searching in the United States than any 
episode since Pearl Harbor. Now there was a "space race" in addition to an "arms 
race," and it was manifest that at least for the time being there was a "space 
lag" to add to the ostensible missile gap.
<P>After the first Sputnik went into orbit, President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
reminded the critics of his administration that, unlike ballistic missile 
development, "our satellite program has never been conducted as a race with 
other nations."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source84"><SUP>84</SUP></A> 
As far as the Soviet Union was concerned, however, there had been a satellite 
race for at least two and perhaps four years before the Sputniks. There was 
probably a Soviet parallel to the highly secret studies carried out in the 
immediate postwar years by the Rand Corporation for the Air Force and by the 
Navy Bureau of Aeronautics on the feasibility and military applicability of 
instrumented Earth satellites.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source85"><SUP>85</SUP></A> 
As late as 1952, however, Albert E. Lombard, scientific adviser in the 
Department of the Air Force, reported that "intelligence information on Soviet 
progress, although fragmentary, has given no indication on Soviet activity in 
this field."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source86"><SUP>86</SUP></A> 
Late the next year, President A. N. Nesmeyanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences 
proclaimed that "Science has reached a state when it is feasible to send a 
stratoplane to the Moon, to create an artificial satellite of the Earth."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source87"><SUP>87</SUP></A> 
A torrent of Soviet books and articles on rockets, satellites, and 
interplanetary travel followed the Nesmeyanov statement.
<P>In August 1955, a few days after the White House announced that the United 
States would launch a series of "small, unmanned, earth-circling satellites" 
during the 18-month International Geophysical Year, beginning July 1, 1957, 
Soviet aeronautical and astronautical expert Leonid Sedov remarked that the 
U.S.S.R. [29] would also send up satellites and that they would be larger than 
the announced American scientific payloads. Most Americans complacently tossed 
off Sedov's claim as another example of Russian braggadocio.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source88"><SUP>88</SUP></A> 
The formal announcement of the Russian space intentions came at the Barcelona 
Geophysical Year Conference in 1956. And in June 1957 the Soviet press 
advertised the radio frequency on which the first Russian satellite would 
transmit signals. By the end of the summer a few American Sovietologists were 
predicting freely that the U.S.S.R. would attempt a satellite launching soon, 
and they were somewhat surprised that the shot did not occur on September 17, 
1957, the centennial of the birth of Tsiolkovsky.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source89"><SUP>89</SUP></A>
<P>American embarrassment reached its apex and American technological prestige 
its nadir just over a month after <I>Sputnik II</I>. As the Senate Preparedness 
Subcommittee, headed by Lyndon B. Johnson, began an investigation of the 
nation's satellite and missile activities, Americans turned their attention to 
Cape Canaveral. There, according to White House Press Secretary James C. 
Hagerty, scientists and engineers from the Naval Research Laboratory and its 
industrial contractors would attempt to put in orbit a grapefruit-sized package 
of instruments as part of Project Vanguard, the American International 
Geophysical Year satellite effort. In reality the Vanguard group was planning 
only to use a test satellite in the first launch of all three active stages of 
the research rocket. To their dismay swarms of newsmen descended on Cape 
Canaveral to watch what the public regarded as this country's effort to get into 
the space race. On December 6, before a national television audience, the 
Vanguard first stage exploded and the rest of the rocket collapsed into the wet 
sand surrounding the launch stand.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source90"><SUP>90</SUP></A>
<P>In the face of the fact that "they" orbited satellites before "we" did, 
together with the apparent complacency of official Washington, the Vanguard 
blowup took on disastrous proportions. McElroy had become Secretary of Defense 
on October 9, after Wilson's resignation. In mid-November he had authorized the 
Army Ballistic Missile Agency at Redstone Arsenal to revive "Project Orbiter." 
This was a scheme for using a Redstone with upper stages to orbit an 
instrumented satellite. It had been proposed jointly by the Office of Naval 
Research and the Army in 1954-1955 but overruled in the Defense Department in 
favor of the Naval Research Laboratory's Vanguard proposal, based on the Viking 
and Aerobee.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source91"><SUP>9l</SUP></A> 
Now Wernher von Braun and company hurriedly converted their Jupiter C reentry 
test vehicle, an elongated Redstone topped by clustered solid-propellant upper 
stages developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, into a satellite launcher.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source92"><SUP>92</SUP></A>
<P>On January 31, 1958, just 84 days after McElroy's go-ahead signal, and 
carrying satellite instruments developed for Project Vanguard by University of 
Iowa physicist James A. Van Allen, a Jupiter C (renamed Juno I by the von Braun 
team) boosted into orbit <I>Explorer I, </I>the first American satellite. The 
total weight of the pencil-shaped payload was about 31 pounds, 18 pounds of 
which consisted of instruments. Following a high elliptical orbit, <I>Explorer I 
</I>transmitted data revealing the existence of a deep zone of radiation 
girdling [30] Earth, dubbed the "Van Allen belt." The following March 17, the 
much maligned Vanguard finally accomplished its purpose, lifting a scientific 
payload weighing a little over 3 pounds into an orbit that was expected to keep 
the satellite up from 200 to 1,000 years. <I>Vanguard I </I>proved what 
geophysicists had long suspected, that Earth is not a perfect sphere but is 
slightly pear-shaped, bulging in the aqueous southern hemisphere. <I>Explorer 
III,</I> with an instrumented weight of 18&frac12; pounds, was fired into orbit by a 
Jupiter C nine days later. But in May a mammoth Soviet rocket launched a 
satellite with the then staggering weight of nearly 3,000 pounds, some 56 times 
as heavy as the combined weight of the three American satellite payloads.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source93"><SUP>93</SUP></A>
<P>Clearly, rockets that could accelerate such bulky unmanned satellites to 
orbital velocity could also send a man into space. And it seemed safe to assume 
that the Soviet politicians, scientists, and military leaders, capitalizing on 
their lead in propulsion systems, had precisely such a feat in mind. When the 
one-and-one half-ton <I>Sputnik III </I>shot into orbit, the Atlas, star of the 
American missile drive, viewed not only as the preeminent weapon of the next 
decade but also as a highly promising space rocket, was still in its 
qualification flight program. Plagued by [31] turbopump problems and fuel 
sloshing, so far it had made only two successful test flights, out of four 
attempts.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-6.htm#source94"><SUP>94</SUP></A>
<P>Yet American military planners remained confident that the Atlas finally 
would become a reliable missile. It must if the United States was not to fall 
perilously behind in the frenzied competition with the Soviets, if the missile 
gap was not to widen. And what of the advocates of manned space flight, the 
ambitious individuals on the fringes of the scientific community, NACA, and the 
military services - people who saw the Atlas, not the frail Vanguard or the 
Jupiter C, as holding the key to space? They also kept their hopes high.

to build a new satellite rocket based on the Viking and the Aerobee, as proposed 
by the Naval Research Laboratory, rather than to adapt the Redstone for the 
Geophysical Year satellite program, as proposed by the Office of Naval Research

<P><A name=source92><SUP>92</SUP></A> After losing out in the satellite rocket 
competition, the Army engineers at Redstone Arsenal had stubbornly sought 
authorization to reactivate their satellite project. Rebuffed in the Defense 
Department, the Army group shrewdly renamed a modified Redstone, which they were 
preparing for tests of the Jupiter reentry nose cone, the Jupiter-C, in order to 
continue receiving funds for the satellite project. See von Braun, "Redstone,
