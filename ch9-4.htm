<H1>Election Year Appraisals</H1>The day that Mercury-Atlas 1 failed so badly, 
NASA Headquarters announced plans to follow Project Mercury with a manned space 
flight program called "Apollo" - a project conceived to carry three men either 
in sustained orbital flight or on circumlunar flight. Several days later, the 
X-15 set two new world records when NASA pilot Joseph A. Walker flew the manned 
rocket on partial power to a speed of 2196 miles per hour and when Major Robert 
M. White shot it up to a height of 136,000 feet over Nevada and California.<A

<P>In mid-August 1960, the Air Force accomplished two significant "firsts" 
within eight days when it managed to recover instrumented packages from the 
thirteenth and fourteenth attempts in its Thor-Agena-launched Discoverer series 
of satellites. <I>Discoverer XIII</I> dropped its 85-pound capsule into the 
Pacific off Hawaii on August 11 after 16 orbits; although a mid-air retrieval 
had failed, frogmen and helicopters from a naval vessel found and returned this, 
the first man-made object recovered intact from an orbital journey. On August 
19, 1960, an Air Force C-119 cargo plane trailing a huge trapeze-like trawl 
succeeded in being at exactly [280] the right place at the right time to snare 
in mid-air the descending instruments from <I>Discoverer XIV</I>. That same day, 
however, the Soviets launched an ark, including the "muttniks" Strelka and 
Belka, and the next day they recovered the dogs and their live companions (rats, 
mice, flies, plants, fungi, and seeds) after 18 orbits above Earth's atmosphere. 
This marked the first successful recovery of living biological specimens from an 
orbital voyage. Three months later, on November 14, 1960, another C-119 aircraft 
succeeded in snatching the reentry capsule from <I>Discoverer XVII</I>, which 
carried human tissue, bacteria, spores, and film emulsions to an orbital apogee 
of 616 miles. For the moment, though, the Soviet achievement was overwhelming in 
its portents for manned space flight.<A

<P>On August 12, 1960, after an attempt that had failed in May, NASA's Project 
Echo succeeded in placing into orbit the first passive communications satellite, 
a 100-foot-diameter aluminized Mylar plastic balloon, which reflected radio 
signals beyond Earth's curvature. Launched by a Thor-Delta vehicle into an orbit 
roughly 1,000 miles from Earth and inclined 47 degrees to the equator, <I>Echo 
I</I> was the first artificial moon that could be seen easily with the naked eye 
by all mankind. Although stargazing aborigines in neolithic cultures of New 
Guinea and Mozambique probably could see the Echo balloon with the unaided eye 
better than sophisticates in the smog and haze of urban-industrial centers from 
California to Kazakhstan, the new pinpoint of light in the heavens was a visible 
manifestation of the "space age." President Eisenhower's broadcast message 
reflected from this sphere circling Earth at 15,000 miles per hour proclaimed: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is a great personal satisfaction to participate in this first 
  experiment in communications involving the use of a satellite balloon known as 
  Echo. This is one more significant step in the United States program of space 
  research and exploration. The program is being carried forward vigorously by 
  the United States for peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.
  <P>The satellite balloon which has reflected these words may be used freely by 
  any nation for similar experiments in its own interests. Information necessary 
  to prepare for such participation was widely distributed some weeks ago.
  <P>The United States will continue to make freely available to the world the 
  scientific information acquired from this and other experiments in its program 
  of space exploration.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>While 
the President was pointing to these and other achievements of the United States 
in the exploration and use of outer space, the Nation was in the midst of a 
highly contested presidential campaign and congressional elections. Four years 
earlier it had seemed sheer whimsy, but now the practical values of space 
exploration and policy decisions on space, missiles, and the Nation were being 
not only examined but reexamined. In September, a month after Strelka and Belka 
were orbited and recovered by the Soviet Union, Premier Khrushchev again came to 
the United States for some personal diplomacy and figurative sabotage in the 
United Nations General Assembly. Afterward he told reporters that his people 
were ready to launch a man into space but had not yet made any such attempt.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source39"><SUP>39</SUP></A> 
[281] No longer could Khrushchev's brogan braggadocio be ignored.
<P>Meeting at Barcelona, on October 7, 1960, the Fédération Aéronautique 
Internationale adopted the first set of rules to govern the award of official 
records for manned space flight. To be recognized under the "Code Sportif" that 
had been setting the rules for aeronautical records since 1905, the first flight 
into space must top at least 100 kilometers; later attempts to set records must 
exceed the existing record by at least 10 percent. Four categories of 
performance were set forth: duration of flight, altitude without orbiting Earth, 
altitude in orbit, and mass lifted above 100 kilometers. To be valid, all claims 
for records "must be supported by information on the date, time, place of 
takeoff and landing, identity of the vehicle commander, and any special 
apparatus used to assist liftoff, landing, or control."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>When in mid-October Soviet tracking ships deployed to stations in the 
Pacific, an alert went out to American forces to expect imminent Soviet attempts 
to fulfill Khrushchev's boast. In mid-August there had been much talk in the 
American press that the United States had "rejoined" the space race as a result 
of recent accomplishments. An Associated Press dispatch on August 8 reported 
that Abe Silverstein was not particularly dismayed by the MA-1 fiasco and 
believed that Project Mercury was "essentially along the same time schedule as 
was initially planned." Congressman Overton Brooks, Democrat from Louisiana and 
chairman of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, waxed much more 
critical of the speed with which Project Mercury was moving. In September 
Glennan warned Americans to be prepared for new Soviet announcements of space 
spectaculars. The Mercury astronauts repeatedly were reported confident that one 
of them could ride a ballistic trajectory either in December or January.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> 
In short, the dramatic race to be first to put a man in space made such colorful 
copy that news editors generally ran stories on the space contest second only to 
news about the political contest.
<P>The news media both reflected and fostered a widespread restlessness over the 
apparent failure of American know-how to equal and surpass Soviet rocket 
technology. Back in October 1959, two years after <I>Sputnik I</I>, 
<I>Newsweek</I> had featured an article, "How to Lose the Space Race," itemizing 
blanket criticisms of all American space programs. To ensure that you have the 
losing ticket, advised <I>Newsweek</I>, simply "start late, downgrade Russian 
feats, fragment authority, pinch pennies, think small, shirk decisions."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> 
At the beginning of 1960, Hanson W. Baldwin, the influential military affairs 
correspondent for the <I>New York Times</I>, had chided the Eisenhower 
administration for neglecting the power of intangible ideas and had advised the 
government to seek more advice from political rather than physical scientists: 
"It is not good enough to say that we have counted more free electrons in the 
ionosphere than the Russians have . . . we must achieve the obvious and the 
spectacular, as well as the erudite and the obscure." And in July 1960 one of 
the deans of space fiction and fact, Arthur C. Clarke, published a [282] 
playful, widely viewed article that suggested that the United States had 
"already suffered a failure of nerve" and forfeited its future by failing to 
"rocket to the renaissance."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>Project Mercury specifically, as 1960 wore on without much to show for the 
taxpayers' millions, began to be criticized more minutely. Perhaps the most 
painful sting felt by the Mercury team came from adverse publicity in 
<I>Missiles and Rockets</I>, a weekly defense industry trade journal, on August 
15, 1960. There, under the heading "Is Mercury Program Headed for Disaster?" 
writer James Barr excoriated Project Mercury: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>NASA's Mercury manned-satellite program appears to be plummeting 
  the United States toward a new humiliating disaster in the East-West space 
  race.
  <P>This is the stark conclusion that looms in the minds of a growing number of 
  eminent rocket scientists and engineers as the Mercury program continues to 
  slip backward.
  <P>These experts, many of whom are already calling Mercury a latter day 
  Vanguard, contend:
  <P>The program today is more than one year behind its original schedule and is 
  expected to slip to two. Therefore, it no longer offers any realistic hope of 
  beating Russia in launching the first man into orbit around the earth - much 
  less serve as an early stepping stone for reaching the moon.
  <P>Despite precautions and improvements, Mercury continues to be a technically 
  marginal program that could easily end in flaming tragedy. Mercury, at best, 
  is a technical stop-gap justifiable only as an expedient. It is no substitute 
  for what is needed sooner or later, a maneuverable spacecraft similar to the 
  Air Force's much hampered Dyna-Soar.
  <P>Mercury originally had the supposed advantage of being cheap, an attribute 
  that made it particularly attractive to the Administration. However, Mercury 
  has proven to be a trip down a dead-end road that U.S. taxpayers are finding 
  themselves paving in gold. Appropriations have reached a quarter-billion to 
  date. They may double.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source44"><SUP>44</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Although 
Barr's animadversion could have been discounted in an election year as a plug 
for more encouragement and funding to the Air Force's Dyna-Soar program, the 
occasions for self- doubt inside Project Mercury indisputably were becoming more 
numerous. On September 16, 1960, Gilruth issued a memorandum for his staff that 
showed the effects of barbs like those from Barr on the morale of the Task 
Group. The subject of the memo was "Favorable Press Comments (for a change)": 
<BLOCKQUOTE>As most of you know, there have been some adverse comments in the 
  press and trade publications about the progress, or lack of progress, being 
  made in Project Mercury during recent weeks. A number of members of the Space 
  Task Group have expressed concern about these articles.
  <P>In any program as broad and complex and as important to our national 
  stature as Project Mercury, it is inevitable that there will be people around 
  us who either will not agree with us, period, or who tend to disagree in one 
  element or another just to be disagreeable. At the same time, there are a 
  number of people around our country who do understand how much work and how 
  much blood and sweat go into an undertaking of this kind.
  <P>
  <CENTER>* * * * * *</CENTER>
  <P>[283] I am personally confident that the work that all of you are doing 
  will bear fruit in the near future. In the interim, I urge all of you to put 
  on your thickest hide, to continue your concerted efforts to make Project 
  Mercury the kind of program it was designed to be, and to reflect with me upon 
  our past accomplishments.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source45"><SUP>45</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>At 
NASA Headquarters there was serious concern over how to answer public 
criticisms. On August 14 Warren North sent the Administrator some arguments 
filling in the contextual background of Mercury schedules:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since the negotiation of the capsule contract, McDonnell personnel 
  have averaged 14% overtime for an equivalent 56 hour week. McDonnell has 
  assigned approximately 13,000 people in direct support of Project Mercury. In 
  October 1959, production went on a 7-day week, three shifts per day. Since 
  January 1960 capsule checkout personnel have worked three shifts per day seven 
  days per week. McDonnell is also working three shifts at Cape Canaveral. 
  During the past eighteen months, Space Task Group personnel have been using 
  less than half their annual leave. Many have used essentially no annual leave 
  since February 1959. Space Task Group personnel at Cape Canaveral worked 
  approximately 50 hours a week preparing for flight operations. When the MA-1 
  capsule was delivered to the Cape on May 23, 1960, this group went on a 
  60-hour week. During the final month of MA-1 preparations, the launch 
  operations crew was working a seventy-hour week. The forthcoming simultaneous 
  operations with Atlas and Redstone will require a continuation of this type of 
  effort.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>On 
September 9, 1960, George Low addressed a United Press International editors 
conference at a hotel in Washington on the subject of the progress made in 
Project Mercury to date. Low began by arguing against three common 
misconceptions about the project in the public press: Mercury was not, he said, 
"merely a stunt," not "designed only to win an important first in the space 
program," and should not "be terminated if the Soviets achieve manned orbital 
flight before we do." Firmly convinced that the Soviets now had the capability 
of achieving manned orbital flight, Low tried to persuade the opinion molders of 
the "fourth estate" to accept Mercury as an indispensable step toward Project 
Apollo, one which "must be carried out regardless of Russian achievement." This 
theme subsequently became official NASA policy. The urgency of Project Mercury 
was transferred onto the higher level of the urgency of manned space flight in 
general and for the future. "It has been a major engineering task," said Low, 
"to design a capsule that is small enough to do the mission, light enough to do 
the mission, and yet has reliable subsystems to accomplish the mission 
safely."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>Within the aerospace community of industrialists, technicians, and Government 
scientists and engineers, the context described by North and Low needed little 
explication. Experience with federally sponsored "R and D" programs since 1940 
helped them understand the difference between a project rating the "DX," or 
highest industrial procurement priority, and one designated an all-out "crash" 
program. Mercury was never a "crash" project in the sense that the Atlas ICBM 
[284] or the Manhattan Project had been, in which duplicative and parallel 
solutions were developed for its most difficult systems. The DX priority for 
materials, NASA's own first rating, and STG's high "sense of urgency" were 
tempered always by the rule of noninterference with priority defense programs. 
In mid- September NASA and the Defense Department agreed to aid each other to 
avoid duplication and waste by means of a new Aeronautics and Astronautics 
Coordinating Board, with Dryden and Herbert F. York as co-chairmen.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>But the citizenry, through the press, saw these problems in simpler terms. 
"Project Mercury: Race or Pure Science?" was a banner headline in a Norfolk 
newspaper of September 11. Richard M. Mansfield related therein how the United 
States "space fever" had fluctuated over the previous three years: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gilruth gets a little angry when people talk about Mercury lagging 
  behind schedule. Some say it is behind as much as a year. Gilruth says this is 
  pure nonsense, that no one can properly put a specific target date on a 
  research program that explores "new frontiers," and is beset by such "detailed 
  problems."
  <P>
  <CENTER>* * * * * *</CENTER>
  <P>Gilruth gave assurance that extra money would not have cut time 
  appreciably. He does not believe that a blank- check crash program would save 
  much time even now.
  <P>"I think we've done our optimum," he said. "It's just like having a baby. 
  Maybe (with more money) we could have had a lot more of them, but you wouldn't 
  have cut the time on any one of them."<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source49"><SUP>49</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Reporter 
Mansfield went on to summarize the conflicting attitudes of scientists who "are 
never in a hurry," with Government employees, including scientists, who must 
respond to the demand of the electorate to "overtake the Soviets." The eagerness 
of the seven American astronauts to make their suborbital flights was tempered, 
he reported, by their recognition that the orbital venture into space had 
already slipped too far. "There is little doubt among them that the Russians 
will have been there first," said Mansfield.
<P>Late in September members of the military and industrial community engaged in 
aerospace and defense business watched with interest for indications where best 
to invest their votes. The editors of <I>Missiles and Rockets</I> addressed an 
open letter to both the Republican and the Democratic candidates for the 
Presidency, inviting comments on a "modest proposal for survival." The journal 
sought specific commitments on the recognition as national policy of the 
strategic space race with Russia and on the endorsement of a bold long-range 
program for space projects during the next decade. Candidate John F. Kennedy 
responded immediately with his concurrence that "we are in a strategic space 
race with the Russians, and we have been losing. . . . if a man orbits earth 
this year his name will be Ivan." To this audience Kennedy also explained one 
meaning of his campaign slogans on "moving ahead" into the "new frontier": "This 
is the new age of exploration; space is our great new frontier." Vice-President 
Richard M. Nixon, seeing the issues of an alleged "missile gap" and of national 
prestige loom ever larger in the [285] later stages of the campaign, at last 
replied by vigorously defending the record of the Eisenhower administration.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source50"><SUP>50</SUP></A> 
The issue of manned space flight was never clearly joined, here or in the 
television debates preceding the election. But after the first Tuesday in 
November, even though the popular vote barely showed a preference, it was clear 
that the next Chief Executive as well as the Congress would be Democratic and 
that this meant change.
<P>Project Mercury, as one large and unproven part of NASA, could expect to be 
influenced by "the gathering storm over space" and some sharp changes in the 
Nation's defense and space programs.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> 
The most forthright change to be expected with the new administration likely 
would be an honest and open admission of the competitive aspects of space 
technology. International negotiations on disarmament had failed to produce any 
further arms control measures since the 1958 Russian-American agreement to 
suspend atmospheric nuclear testing. Efforts in the United Nations to exempt 
space as an arena for international rivalries, following the example of the 1959 
Antarctica treaty, had so far failed. It seemed purely sentimental to act as if 
coexistence would become any less competitive. Besides, recent successes of 
American missiles reinforced the United States' foreign policy of steadfast 
resistance to Communist encroachments. An Atlas ICBM had again flown 9,000 miles 
for a bullseye in the Indian Ocean on September 19, 1960; the Thor was 
operational, and the Polaris and Titan weapon systems were in active test 
phases. A "booster gap" there admittedly was, but the "missile gap" appeared 
closed, at least to discussion, after the election. The new President would 
probably find it politic to move speedily but cautiously toward a more intensive 
national (in contrast to a scientific-international) space program. Kennedy was 
historically minded and could be trusted to see "the present in perspective," 
but whether he would consider, as one professional historian did, "manned space 
flight as the main object of Russo-American rivalry" was entirely moot.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>Congressional attitudes before and after the election of 1960 seemed to 
change less drastically because Congress was already Democratic and had been 
critical of the Republican "no-race" thesis for three years now. Some of those 
legislative representatives who felt a need to justify their loyal opposition to 
Eisenhower and their support for manned space exploration could do so by mailing 
their constituents a congressional staff report entitled "The Practical Values 
of Space Exploration." Philip B. Yeager, a staff member of the House Committee 
on Science and Astronautics, wrote this pamphlet "to explain to the taxpayer 
just why so many of his dollars are going into the American effort to explore 
space, and to indicate what he can expect in return which is of value to him." 
Two editions of this report, before and after the election, began with a 
quotation from a Russian workman who reportedly complained in a letter published 
on the front page of <I>Pravda</I> for June 12, 1960: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>What do Sputniks give to a person like me? . . . So much money is 
  spent on Sputniks it makes people gasp. If there were no Sputniks the 
  Government [286] could cut the cost of cloth for an overcoat in half and put a 
  few electric flatirons in the stores. Rockets, rockets, rockets. Who needs 
  them now?<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-4.htm#source53"><SUP>53</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Neither 
edition of Yeager's staff report spoke explicitly about Project Mercury, but 
both implicitly illustrated Mercury‘s motivation. The author delineated in lay 
language five categories of values served by national space programs. Intangible 
values came first and included scientific curiosity and the human urge to do as 
well as to know. National security was second, and included the argument for 
space rivalry as a substitute for war. Economic benefits, immediate and remote, 
were described in social terms for the third category. "Values for everyday 
living" described some of the technological and medical "fallout" or "spin-off" 
from space-related research. And finally this pamphlet pointed to long-range 
values and to possible interrelationships with the population explosion, water 
shortages, soil erosion, new leisure time, and the scientific and spiritual 
aspirations of humanity. In conclusion Yeager chose to quote a paragraph, from 
an editorial in the magazine <I>Industrial Research</I>, which "sober study 
indicates . . . may not be too 'far out' after all": 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Space technology is probably the fastest moving, typically free 
  enterprise and democratic industry yet created. It puts a premium not on 
  salesmanship, but on what it needs most - intellectual production, the 
  research payoff. Unlike any other existing industry, space functions on hope 
  and future possibilities, conquest of real estate unseen, of near vacuum 
  unexplored. At once it obliterates the economic reason for war, the threat of 
  overpopulation, or cultural stagnation; it offers to replace guesswork with 
  the scientific method for archeological, philosophical, and religious 
  themes.<A

Comments (for a change)," with two enclosures, Sept. 16, 1960: Marvin Miles' 
article described the "recent splurge of sniping at the Mercury program," and 
Glennan's letter of August 26 commended the article "as a shot of adrenalin" for 
all the workers on Mercury.

<P><A name=source46><SUP>46</SUP></A> Memo, North to Administrator, "Background 
of Project Mercury Schedules," with enclosures, including a chronology, Aug. 14, 
1960. Significant excerpts from this memo illustrated other features of 
Headquarters concerns:
<P>&ldquo;A major factor in the compressed Mercury schedule is concurrent effort in 
the areas of research and development, design, and manufacturing. As a result of 
this concurrent effort, many of the capsule subcontractors underestimated their 
costs and delivery dates. As early as October 1959, McDonnell anticipated cost 
increases ranging from 200% to 450% from some of their major subcontractors, 
such as Bell Aircraft, AiResearch, Collins Radio, and Grand Central Rocket.
<P>&ldquo;Because of different flight test objectives, it is possible to fly some of 
the early capsules with incomplete and unqualified systems.
<P>&ldquo;From the standpoint of project urgency, it was consistent policy to set . . 
. classified target schedules as tight as possible. . . . However, since problem 
areas cannot be pinpointed in advance, it was felt that the project objectives 
could be most rapidly achieved by purposely setting optimistic target schedules 
and keeping everyone working to meet these dates. . . .
<P>"One is tempted to extrapolate . . . thereby obtaining May 1961 and November 
1961, as the actual launch dates for the manned Redstone and manned orbital 
flights. It is hoped, however, that based on past experience, subsequent 
capsules can be more accurately scheduled through capsule systems checkout. 
Conversely, it must also be remembered that as yet none of the production 
capsules have been qualified during the maximum Q abort and reentry missions."

<P><A name=source54><SUP>54</SUP></A> <I>Ibid</I>., 54. Aside from the better 
illustrations and the updated figures on space costs and accomplishments, the 
August 1961 revision of this report contained one significant addition, namely a 
two-page (20-22) discussion in the national security section entitled 
"Interpreting The Race," which said in part:
<P>&ldquo;The fact that we are racing the Russians to the moon and the planets should 
not be allowed to obscure certain facets of the precise situation we are in.
<P>&ldquo;To begin with, it is essential to realize that sending men beyond earth's 
environment requires rockets of very high thrust - big boosters. The Soviets, 
who have about a 5-year jump on the United States in this field, have such 
rockets in operation. Our biggest ones are still in the development stage, 
although they are showing considerable promise. So we begin this particular 
phase of 'the race' under a marked handicap and doubtless will be in second 
place for some time to come.
<P>&ldquo;It is equally important, however, to recognize that 'getting there first' is 
only one part of the race. Two other parts are just as crucial:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>What will we learn from our effort to explore beyond the Earth? 
  <LI>How will we use this knowledge after it is acquired?</LI></OL>&ldquo;The Vikings 
had the technique to get to the New World 'first,' but England, France, and 
Spain won the prizes.... With no intent to deprecate the notable achievements of 
the Soviet Union in space research, it can nonetheless be said that the broad 
scope of the American effort has - thus far at least - been outstanding in its 
scientific results. And, as subsequent parts of this report suggest, our free 
enterprise system has been quick to take advantage of the technological fall 
out.
<P>"In summary, our international prestige and stature, so far as they are 
influenced by our space activities, depend on all three elements of 'the race' - 
not on one or two."
