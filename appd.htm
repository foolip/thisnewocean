<H1>Appendix D<BR>
Flight Data Summary</H1>The information in this revised flight data summary 
is taken from various sources according to the authors' best estimate of 
reliability. The basic format was made by Jack C. Heberlig for the NASA-MSC 
newspaper issue of "Mercury Program Summary," October 3&ndash;4, 1963, then 
republished as MSC Fact Sheet No. 201 and in <I>Mercury Project Summary</I>, 
NASA SP-45, pages 50&ndash;51. But in expanding this chart, converting it to commonly 
understood units, and judging each mission's success or failure in the light of 
the overall program objectives, the authors have returned to the primary 
classified postlaunch memorandum reports for most of the figures herein.
<P>The sixth column of the table shows the originally scheduled (January 1959) 
launch date. This early schedule represented optimistic planning in that it 
assumed a trouble-free preparation and flight program. As the program 
progressed, some flights were eliminated, others added, and objectives expanded, 
based on experience gained.
