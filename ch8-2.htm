<H1>Controlling the Hostile Environment</H1>[225] To replace the old warhead 
payloads with inhabitable cockpits on the missiles used to transport man into 
space required reliable, lightweight means of sustaining life beyond the 
atmosphere. When man ascends from the bottom of the ocean of air where life as 
we know it has evolved, he must stay inside a pressurized cell of air or die in 
the vacuum of space. Engineering the environmental cocoon to provide the basic 
metabolic needs of man became, through 1959 and 1960, one of the most complex 
and critical aspects in Mercury's development. Aristotle's classical 
anthropocentric elements - earth, water, air, and fire - correspond roughly to 
man's need for the gravisphere and atmospheric pressure, for hydration and waste 
disposal, for oxygen to breathe through lungs and skin, and for temperature and 
humidity control. Safety required that these life systems be redundant wherever 
feasible. The oxygen envelope, for instance, should be contained within the 
welded walls of the pressure vessel, but in case of leak, puncture, or blowout, 
the astronaut would wear a suit that was a second inner casing, fully capable of 
life support in a decompressed capsule.<A

<P>The environmental control system for Mercury, logically divided into the 
cabin and suit subsystems, grew directly out of previous aviation experience in 
maintaining men and machines at high altitudes. McDonnell had to seal 
hermetically the pressure vessel within prescribed limits; a subcontractor 
developed the dual air-conditioning system. Because the clothing needed for 
space travel turned out to be unavailable from the shelves of government issue, 
another subcontractor was called upon to make a full-pressure suit that would in 
effect be a secondary cabin.
<P>When McDonnell and STG engineers first considered the problems of the 
pressurized cabin, they sought the experience of the foremost company of 
industrial specialists on the subject. AiResearch had grown since the 1930s into 
the Manufacturing Division of the Garrett Corporation, the Nation's primary 
supplier of the needs of the pressurized flight industry.<A

In January 1959 the three groups began to discuss the most realistic design 
criteria for ambient and partial gas pressures, air and water regeneration 
methods, thermostats, and heat exchangers. R. A. Fischer, Edward H. Olling, and 
Richard C. Nelson of Garrett, Herbert R. Greider, John R. Barton, and Earl A. 
Reed of McDonnell, and Stanley C. White and Richard S. Johnston of STG were the 
principal designers of this system.
<P>While the process of fabricating the pressure-vessel shell by the 
fusion-welding techniques of William Dubusker and his production engineers was 
cut and tried on the factory floor, the important question of cabin atmosphere 
gas composition was being debated by physicians and physicists. Should the cabin 
air and pressure imitate "sea level" air mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen, or 
should the space cabin endorse the experience of aviation and use at highest 
altitude whatever would guarantee oxygenation?<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-2.htm#source6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> 
Stanley White championed the latter position forcefully, in response to rather 
late outside criticism that "shirtsleeve" environmental [226] air might be 
preferable. John F. Yardley and Barton, Faget and Johnston agreed emphatically 
that a five-pound-per-square-inch pressure of pure oxygen would be far more 
practical for saving weight, controlling leakage, and avoiding the extremely 
difficult problem of providing reliable oxygen partial-pressure sensors. Faget 
explained STG's choice: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important consideration in choice of a single gas 
  atmosphere is reliability of operation. If a mixed gas atmosphere were used, a 
  major increase in complexity in the atmospheric control system and in 
  monitoring and display instrumentation would have resulted. Furthermore, the 
  use of a mixed gas system would have precluded the use of simple mechanical 
  systems for a great number of these functions which in itself would have 
  decreased the reliability of performance.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-2.htm#source7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Reduced 
to practice, these designs had evolved into hardware for three spherical oxygen 
bottles, tested at 7500 pounds per square inch, with simple regulator valves, a 
lithium hydroxide canister to remove carbon dioxide and odors, an evaporator 
heat exchanger (its water would boil around 35 degrees F at a 100-mile 
altitude), and a simple pulsating-sponge water removal system, all to be located 
beneath the astronaut's legs. Blowers, a fan, snorkels, and plumbing were also 
included to make the capsule livable under the extremely diverse conditions 
existing before, during, and after an orbital mission. The most novel parts of 
this system were the high-pressure oxygen bottles, the use of lithium hydroxide, 
and the "sponge squeezer" to collect perspiration and respiration water vapor 
from the cabin atmosphere. Cleanliness in the manufacture of these components 
was so important that AiResearch built the first "surgery," or "white room," for 
Mercury fabrication in the summer of 1959.<A

<P>McDonnell and AiResearch engineers consulted the voluminous literature on 
aeromedicine before imposing STG's specific requirements on top of the state of 
their art. One of the best independent guides to that state was a report 
prepared in mid-1959 by A. B. Thompson of Chance Vought Astronautics, entitled 
"Physiological and Psychological Considerations for Manned Space Flight." 
Thompson compiled a consensus on environmental parameters derived from a wide 
number of sources; then he presented these factors systematically in the order 
of their occurrence on a typical orbital mission. Concerning the internal 
atmospheric environment, he drew heavily from submarine, as well as aviation, 
practice and expressed particular concern over abnormal toxicities peculiar to 
space conditions. Regarding temperature tolerance, Thompson wrote: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Man can exist and carry out simple tasks in environmental 
  temperatures from - 40° to 140° if suitable clothing is worn for the low, and 
  if humidity is kept at 30-50% for the high. Time of exposure to high 
  temperatures should be well below man's tolerance limits. Up to 160°F can be 
  withstood for 20 minutes. Such temperature highs are possible at reentry into 
  atmosphere. Insulation, double walls, cabin temperature and atmosphere cooling 
  should limit the heat of cabin to less than 140°F even when skin temperature 
  of the vehicle is much higher.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-2.htm#source9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>[227] 
Between John Barton of McDonnell and Edward Olling of AiResearch, the system 
specifications for environmental control began to emerge in mid-1959, subject to 
continuous reappraisal as other systems also took shape. Their original set of 
design parameters rather arbitrarily selected 400 British thermal units per hour 
for one man's average heat production rate over 28 hours, and an ambient 
pressure of 5 pounds per square inch circulating through the cabin, with a 
breathable supply of oxygen at the partial pressure of 3.8 pounds. An assumed 
oxygen consumption rate of 500 cubic centimeters per minute allowed a slight 
margin for suit leakage. Setting the average rate of perspiratory and 
respiratory water production at 6 pounds per day dictated the weight and size of 
their system's hardware.
<P>Particularly knotty for the development of the active air-conditioning system 
and the passive insulation to control the cabin temperature was a problem that 
Barton described in terms of applied thermodynamics: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Studies of launch, orbit and reentry heating effects disclosed 
  that the insulation requirements for the cabin side-walls for the orbit and 
  reentry phases were diametrically opposed. In orbit it is desirable to lose 
  heat from the side-walls and during reentry it is necessary to prevent the 
  entry of heat. The reentry phase, being more critical, dictated the side-wall 
  insulation. In orbit, the insulation becomes an almost perfect heat barrier 
  and dictates that the cabin cooling be primarily accomplished by the cabin 
  heat exchanger.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-2.htm#source10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>At 
the end of July 1959, Barton and Frank G. Morgan, Jr., met with 18 STG 
engineers, including all the astronauts, to describe the basic designs and 
developmental problems, especially leaky instrumentation fittings, for the 
system now known as "the ECS." Faget, White, William K. Douglas, William S. 
Augerson, and Robert B. Voas, and the ECS systems engineers, Richard Johnston, 
Frank H. Samonski, and Morton Schler, all warned that the design parameters were 
set too low. They demanded larger margins of at least 1000 British thermal units 
per hour for astronaut heat generation, at least 7 pounds per day assumed water 
production, and certainly no less oxygen pressure in the suit than in the 
cabin.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-2.htm#source11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> 
Greider and Barton warned the astronauts to learn early and thoroughly the 
symptoms of hypoxia in themselves so they could take action soon enough to 
ensure an emergency oxygen supply. Otherwise probe sensors of some sort in the 
nostrils or the lungs might be necessary.
<P>McDonnell hurried the building of a "man-rating" environmental system test 
chamber through September 1959, so that a reliability test program for each 
subsystem could be conducted, complete systems tests could be scheduled, and 
astronaut familiarization training could begin as soon as possible. By the end 
of the month, Gilbert B. North, as McDonnell's test astronaut, had endured so 
many failures or inadequacies in the bench testing that STG sought the aid of 
physiologists from Duke University School of Medicine and from the Navy Air Crew 
Equipment Laboratory in Philadelphia to help speed the man-rating of the 
environmental control system. At the end of January 1960, neither the cabin nor 
the suit environmental control system had passed its test to operate as designed 
for 28 hours. [228] Richard Johnston reported that experience with the system 
was still "rather meager." He urged aeromedical investigators to provide more 
"realistic metabolic data" for his engineers to use in system redesign.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-2.htm#source12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>Difficulties with the body ventilation and post-landing snorkel ventilation 
subsystems continued troublesome through 1960. Extensive testing at AiResearch 
and intensive manned tests at McDonnell beginning in June slowly eradicated most 
of the "bugs" plaguing the reliability of the environmental control system. A 
robot "crewman simulator," designed primarily by Charles F. Jahn and Eugene 
Wulfkehler at McDonnell, served to calibrate the physical parameters for average 
human inputs and outputs to this closed ecological system. Then, too, Gilbert 
North and Herbert Greider learned to outwit the peculiarities of the mechanisms 
to avoid hypoxia, dysbarism, and hyperventilation. The initial manned tests of 
the ECS hardware were endured by McDonnell volunteers; occasionally the Mercury 
astronauts would observe. Gas analysis problems delayed the accumulation of 
reliability records and the verification of certain operational procedures, such 
as ground purge and ground cooling, until early 1961.<A
