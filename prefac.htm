<H1>Preface</H1>[xi] Mankind in the past few years has sailed on one of its 
greatest adventures, the exploration of near space. Men have cast off their 
physical and mental moorings to Earth, and a few have learned to live in balance 
with their gravisphere and above their atmosphere. Transgressing old laws of 
terrestrial navigation and amending newer laws of aerodynamics, man has combined 
the experience gained from aviation and rocket technology with the science of 
celestial mechanics, thus to accomplish for the first time manned orbital 
circumnavigation. The initial American voyages in this new epic of exploration 
and discovery were products of Project Mercury, an intensive national program 
mobilizing creative science and technology to orbit and retrieve a manned Earth 
satellite.
<P>This book is an attempt to describe the origins, preparation, and nature of 
America's first achievements in manned space flight. Neither a history of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) nor a comparative study of 
the competition in space between the United States and the Soviet Union, this 
narrative spans the basic events in the managerial and technological history of 
Project Mercury.
<P>The authors have no illusions that this single volume is complete or 
"definitive" (if any work of history ever can be). Writing only a few years 
after the events described, we inescapably suffer from short perspective, but 
perhaps our scholarly myopia is balanced by our having had access to a multitude 
of still-dustless documents and to most of the main participants in Project 
Mercury. Within obvious limitations of chronology and the sensitivities of 
persons still active in the conquest of space, we have tried to make this 
narrative as comprehensive and accurate as possible in one volume.
<P>Already Project Mercury has come to be regarded as a single episode in the 
history of flight and of the United States. Rather, it was many episodes, many 
people, many days of inspiration, frustration, and elation. Journalists and 
other contemporary observers have written millions of words, taken thousands of 
photographs, and produced hundreds of reports, official and otherwise, on the 
origins, development, failures, successes, and significance of this country's 
first efforts in the manned exploration of space. The foremost image of Mercury 
emerging from its mountainous publicity was that of seven selected test pilots 
called "astronauts." Central as were their roles and critical as were their 
risks in the individual manned flights, the astronauts themselves did not 
design, develop, or decide the means and [xii] ends of the overall program. 
Thousands of engineers, scientists, technicians, and administrators, as well as 
the seven astronauts, cooperated to fulfill Mercury's goals, and this program 
history tries to blend and balance the personal, social, and technical facets of 
the project as it progressed.
<P>Endeavoring to keep fickle human memories accurate in an age that moves 
incredibly fast in too many directions, we have sought to answer unanswered 
questions, to answer some questions that had not been asked, and even perhaps to 
pose some questions that cannot be answered yet. Written under sponsorship of 
NASA at its Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) with principal reliance on a contract 
with the University of Houston, this study is, in the legal sense of the Space 
Act of 1958, an "official" history of Project Mercury. But NASA and its 
Historical Advisory Committee have wisely recognized that history should be 
written, taught, and finally judged by historians, and that the ultimate 
responsibility for historical generalizations and interpretations should rest 
with the authors. Accordingly, while we have trod circumspectly in places, we 
have been encouraged to arrive at historical judgments judiciously and 
independently. Thus there actually is no "official" NASA or MSC viewpoint on 
what happened. More details and acknowledgments on the historiography behind 
this work are to be found in the Note on Sources and Selected Bibliography at 
the end of the volume.
<P>The organization and division of labor imposed on the narrative conforms to 
its chronology, to three genres of historical literature, and to the thesis that 
Project Mercury, from its inception in the fall of 1958, was preeminently an 
engineering, rather than a scientific, enterprise.
<P>Part One, entitled "Research," could be called "origins" or "antecedents." 
This section on the long and complex "prehistory" of Project Mercury follows 
essentially a topical organization and might be seen as part of the external 
history of applied science. Emphasizing the contributions of individual minds 
and small groups of experimentalists, Part One recounts primarily progress in 
rocketry and research in space medicine, aerodynamics, and thermodynamics from 
the end of the Second World War to the inception of the first United States 
manned satellite project. The focus is on the evolutionary roles of the military 
services and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, organizational 
nucleus of NASA.
<P>Part Two, "Development," assumes with reason that all of the basic and most 
of the applied research necessary for undertaking a manned ballistic satellite 
project had been completed by October 1958. Thus the so-called research and 
development, or "R and D," phase of Mercury is mostly, if not entirely, "D" and 
corresponds to a relatively new professional interest, the history of 
technology. Part Two is a study of corporate technology in the crowded period 
during which the concurrent teamwork of previously diverse organizations drove 
toward placing a man in orbit around Earth.
<P>For most people directly involved in Mercury, the dramatic "space race" 
aspect of the project was secondary to the accomplishment of an almost 
incredibly complex managerial and technological endeavor. Yet the historian 
cannot ignore [xiii] the broadly political and social context surrounding all of 
the organizing, contracting, innovating, manufacturing, training, and testing 
before the time in 1961 when men first rocketed into space. Costs, schedules, 
and "quality control" - the range of procedures designed to ensure reliability 
during space vehicle manufacturing and preparation for flight - were far less 
dramatic than the flights themselves. But the NASA Space Task Group, primarily 
responsible for the development of Mercury, had an exciting life of its own as 
it evolved into the Manned Spacecraft Center. The Mercury team was much larger 
than the Space Task Group, or even than NASA, but the focus in Part Two on the 
field managers of the project should be meaningful for anyone wishing insight 
into the enormity and intricacy of modern government-managed technological 
programs.
<P>Part Three, entitled "Operations," describes the fulfillment of Project 
Mercury and the only part of the program witnessed by most contemporary 
observers. This section begins with the successful suborbital flight of 
Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., in May 1961; proceeds through the completion of 
the orbital qualification of the Mercury spacecraft and the Atlas rocket; and 
ends with the four manned orbital missions, stretching from three to 22 circuits 
of Earth, in 1962 and 1963. Part Three is allied with a heroic tradition, the 
history of exploration and discovery.
<P>Cosmonaut Yuri A. Gagarin first made a space flight around Earth on April 12, 
1961, and four months later Gherman Titov's 17-orbit flight pushed the U.S.S.R. 
still further ahead in the cold war space competition. With American 
technological prestige damaged in the court of world opinion, the United States 
responded after Shepard's suborbital ride, when President John F. Kennedy 
proposed and an eager Congress agreed to make Mercury the first phase of an 
epochal national venture in the manned exploration of the Earth-Moon system.
<P>Although the Soviet Union succeeded in orbiting more space travelers, for 
longer periods, and sooner than the United States, Project Mercury still appears 
magnificently successful. It cost more money and took more time than originally 
expected, but no precaution was overlooked and no astronaut was lost. And as the 
"space race" broadened into the "space olympics," Mercury evolved from a 
"dead-end" endeavor, pointed solely at achieving orbital flight and recovery, 
into a prerequisite course in what was needed to reach and return from the Moon.
<P>If Mercury was not all that it might have been, it was certainly more than it 
originally was supposed to be. Less than three and a half years after its 
inception, its prime objectives were attained with the three-orbit flight of 
Astronaut John H. Glenn, Jr. In all, the Mercury astronauts flew two ballistic, 
parabolic flights into space and four orbital missions. Each flight went almost 
as well as planned, thereby substantially enlarging man's knowledge of near 
space, of his psychophysiological behavior beyond Earth's atmosphere, and of the 
impending requirements for cislunar travel. By June 12, 1963, when James E. 
Webb, the second NASA Administrator, announced its termination, Project Mercury 
had [xiv] become the focal point of the American people's vicarious journey into 
space, the first rung on a ladder leading to the Moon, and perhaps beyond.
<P>This volume, therefore, represents an effort to lift out of anonymity, where 
so much of mankind's technological progress lies buried, the odyssey of the men 
who developed the means for escaping our age-old habitat. We hope to enlarge 
man's knowledge of himself by recording who did what, when, and where to achieve 
the confidence and provide the machines for space flight. We have aimed to 
supply a reference to the past, a benchmark for the present, and a source for 
future scholarship. Later historians will write about Gemini and Apollo, and 
about Ranger, Mariner, and other projects in space exploration by men of our 
times. But like students of Mercury, present and future, they must begin with an 
accurate record of technological achievement. In time, perhaps, Project Mercury 
may deserve more, because it was both an effect of and a cause for the faith, 
vision, and prowess necessary to explore space.

<P>This history of Project Mercury is, in more 
than the usual sense, drawn from the memory of many of the primary participants 
in the program. They provided much of the documentation upon which this 
narrative is based, and some 150 of them have commented upon all or parts of a 
review edition before publication. They are not responsible, however, for the 
selection, organization, or interpretations of facts as here presented. If 
errors persist in this account, the fault lies solely with the authors.
<P>A different emphasis might have been pursued in this history - perhaps, for 
instance, more on the management of manned space programs. But Project Mercury 
per se is the focus herein, and as history it is meant to be read consecutively. 
In the launching of this history, the endorsement and support of the late Hugh 
L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator of NASA (1958&ndash;1965); Chancellor George L. 
Simpson of the University of Georgia System, former Assistant Deputy 
Administrator (1962&ndash;1965); and Robert R. Gilruth, Director of the Manned 
Spacecraft Center, proved instrumental. Whatever value this volume may have in 
reflecting the broader concerns of NASA Headquarters results largely from the 
contributions of Eugene M. Emme, the NASA Historian, and Frank W. Anderson, the 
Deputy NASA Historian. They have minutely read and criticized the draft 
manuscripts and coordinated the details of publication.
<P>Paul E. Purser, Special Assistant to the Director, Manned Spacecraft Center, 
and Allen J. Going, Chairman, Department of History, University of Houston, have 
read various phases of the draft work and suggested improvements at every step. 
Sigman Byrd and Pamela C. Johnson worked with the authors as editorial and 
research assistants in its formative stages. Ivan D. Ertel made the final index 
and basic selection of illustrations. Sally D. Gates made many invaluable 
editorial suggestions and comments, typed several "final" drafts, and 
administratively [xv] coordinated the review edition with the numerous readers. 
Geri A. Vanderoef typed many of the early manuscripts in the constant revision 
process.
<P>Among those NASA field center historians and monitors who have been most 
helpful are David S. Akens of the Marshall Space Flight Center; Alfred Rosenthal 
of the Goddard Space Flight Center; Robert A. Lindemann and Francis E. Jarrett, 
Jr., of the Kennedy Space Center; Manley Hood and John B. Talmadge of the Ames 
Research Center; Lyndell L. Manley of the Lewis Research Center; and Robert W. 
Mulac of the Langley Research Center.
<P>Government - particularly Air Force - and industrial historians, librarians, 
and archivists too numerous to mention offered courteous assistance on many 
aspects of Project Mercury. William D. Putnam, Office of Manned Space Flight and 
formerly of the Air Force Space Systems Division; Max Rosenberg of the Air Force 
Historical Liaison Office; Charles V. Eppley, Air Force Flight Test Center; 
Marvin E. Hintz, Air Force Arnold Engineering Development Center; Green Peyton 
of the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine; Michael Witunski of the McDonnell 
Aircraft Corporation; Ralph B. Oakley of North American Aviation; and Louis 
Canter of General Dynamics/Astronautics deserve special mention and thanks.
<P>At the Manned Spacecraft Center, the Public Affairs Office, under Paul P. 
Haney and Albert M. Chop, provided documentation, contract support, and many 
hours of critical reading; the Technical Library, through the efforts of Retha 
Shirkey, furnished literature; and the Technical Information Division's Robert 
W. Fricke helped immeasurably in securing documentation.
<P>Countless others also should be mentioned for their aid on specific 
questions, but most of them have been credited in the citations.
