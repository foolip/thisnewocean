<H1>Calling for a Capsule Contractor</H1>The Space Task Group was ready by 
October 20, 1958, to initiate the formal quest for the best builder of a 
spacecraft. Silverstein, Gilruth, Donlan, Faget, Mathews, and Zimmerman had 
decided what they wanted; now the top-priority need was to decide which 
contractor would be most competent to construct, [121] at maximum reliability 
and speed and with minimum cost and risk, the first manned spacecraft.
<P>Preliminary specifications for capsule and subsystems were mailed by the 
Langley procurement office to more than 40 prospective firms on October 23, 
1958. Thirty-eight of these companies responded by sending representatives to 
the bidders' conference at Langley Field on November 7. The briefing was 
conducted by Faget, Alan Kehlet, Aleck Bond, Andre Meyer, Jack Heberlig, and 
several others from STG and Langley. The verbal exchange of ideas at this 
meeting was preliminary to corporate expressions of interest expected by STG 
before mid-November. After that the Task Group would mail out formal 
specifications as the basis for bid proposals to be submitted before December 
11, 1958. After his part of the briefing, Faget was asked by one of the 
representatives whether the retrorockets described could also be used for 
escape. Faget said no and explained why not. He then made it clear that any 
alternative capsule configurations would be considered "provided that you 
incorporate the retrorocket principle, the non-lifting principle, and the 
non-ablating heat sink principle."<A

<P>Nineteen of the companies present expressed interest in the competition; they 
were mailed copies of STG's 50-page "Specifications for Manned Space Capsule" on 
November 14, 1958. This document, officially numbered "S-6," formally described 
STG's expectations of the missions, configurations, stabilization and control, 
structural design, onboard equipment, instrumentation, and testing for manned 
orbital flight, but significantly it did not deal in detail with reliability, 
costs, or schedules for flight testing.<A

<P>By December 11, the deadline for bid proposals, the list of original 
competitors had narrowed to 11; there was a late starter in Winzen Research, 
Inc., whose proposal was incomplete. All but three of these manufacturers had 
been engaged for at least a year with feasibility studies related to the Air 
Force plans for a manned satellite. Of the 11, the eight corporations with 
deepest investments were Avco, Convair/Astronautics, Lockheed, Martin, 
McDonnell, North American, Northrop, and Republic. The three other bidders were 
the Douglas, Grumman, and Chance-Vought aircraft companies. Significantly 
perhaps, certain other major missile and aircraft companies, like Bell, Boeing, 
and United Aircraft, were not represented. Bell was preoccupied with the 
Dyna-Soar studies; Boeing also was working on Dyna-Soar and had obtained the 
prime contract for the Minuteman missile system; and United Aircraft sent its 
regrets to Reid that it was otherwise deeply committed.<A

Other military research and development contracts, such as those for the XB-70 
"Valkyrie" and XF-108 were also competing for the attention of the aerospace 
industry.
<P>The Space Task Group and NASA Headquarters meanwhile had worked out the 
procedures for technical assessment of these manufacturers' proposals and for 
contractual evaluations and negotiations. At Langley, a Technical Assessment 
Committee headed by Donlan was to appoint 11 component assessment teams to rate 
the contending companies in each of 11 technical areas. The classification [122] 
system set up by the Space Task Group to evaluate these competitors for the 
spacecraft contract illustrated the major areas of concern.
<P>Between four and six research engineers sat on each of the following 11 
components assessment teams: systems integration; load, structure, and 
heatshield; escape system; retrograde and landing system; attitude control 
systems; environmental systems; pilot support and restraint system; pilot 
displays and navigational aids; communications systems; instrumentation sensors, 
recorders, and telemeters; and power supplies. Each area was rated on a 
five-point scale ranging from excellent to unsatisfactory; the scores from these 
ratings were averaged to provide an overall technical order of preference.
<P>All this had to be done over the Christmas holidays and while the Task Group 
was moving from the Unitary Wind Tunnel building on the west side of Langley Air 
Force Base to new quarters in an old NACA building on the east side. Early in 
January at NASA Headquarters a similar assessment team would gather to evaluate 
the competitors on their competence in management and cost accountability. 
MacDougall was to be the only Task Group representative on the "business 
evaluation" committee. Finally, a Source Selection Board, chaired by Silverstein 
at NASA Headquarters and including Zimmerman from STG, would review the grading, 
approve it, and make its final recommendation for the choice of the spacecraft 
contractor.<A

<P>Although virtually everyone in the Task Group participated in the process of 
selecting the capsule builder, there were other equally pressing tasks to be 
accomplished as soon as possible.Procurement of booster rockets, the detailed 
design and development of a smaller, cheaper test booster, and the problem of 
finding the best volunteers to man the finished product - these were seen as the 
major problems requiring a head start in the fall of 1958.

of 1954, the X-15 research airplane attracted nine companies to attend the 
bidders' briefing, and only four submitted bids. Walter C. Williams, interview,
