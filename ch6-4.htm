<H1>Heatshield Resolution</H1>To begin with, all capsule proposals had been 
evaluated on the basis of a beryllium heat sink, but the search for an ablating 
heatshield continued concurrently. George M. Low reported the tentative 
resolution of this conflict in late January: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>At a meeting held at Langley Field on January 16 (attended by Drs. 
  Dryden and Silverstein), it was decided to negotiate with McDonnell to design 
  the capsule so that it can be fitted with either a beryllium heat sink or an 
  ablation heat shield. It was further decided that McDonnell should supply 
  [139] a specified number (of the order of eight) ablation shields and a 
  specified number (of the order of six) beryllium heat sinks. It is anticipated 
  that flights with both types of heat protection will be made . . . . In case 
  of a recovery on land, the capsule with a beryllium heat sink will require 
  cooling; this is accomplished by circulating air either between the heat sink 
  and the pressure vessel, or by ventilating the pressure vessel after impact.<A

the escape system, McDonnell's proposal had carefully weighed the relative 
merits of STG's pylon, or tower, type of tractor rocket with the alternative 
idea, which used three sets of dual-pod pusher rockets, similar to JATO bottles, 
along either side of three fins at the base of the capsule. McDonnell chose the 
latter system for its design proposal, but the STG idea prevailed through the 
contract negotiations, because the Redstone was calculated to become 
aerodynamically unstable with the pod-type escape system, and the Atlas would 
likely be damaged by jettisoning the pod fins.<A

The escape system for an aborted launch was intimately interrelated with the 
problems of the heatshield and of the normal, or nominal, landing plans. By 
mid-March Robert F. Thompson's detailed proposals for a water landing helped 
clarify the nature of the test programs to be conducted.
<P>While McDonnell agreed to design the capsule so that it could be fitted 
alternatively with either a beryllium heat sink or an ablation heatshield, the 
prime contractor farmed the fabrication of these elements to three 
subcontractors: Brush Beryllium Company of Cleveland was to forge six heat-sink 
heatshields; General Electric Company and Cincinnati Testing and Research 
Laboratory (CTL) were to fabricate 12 ablation shields. The Space Task Group 
relied on Andre J. Meyer, Jr., to monitor this critical and sensitive problem, 
the solution to which would constitute the foremost technological secret in the 
specifications for the manned capsule.
<P>Meyer, one of the original STG members from Lewis in Cleveland, had been 
commuting to Langley for 10 months. He soon discovered a bottleneck in the 
industrial availability of beryllium. Only two suppliers were found in this 
country; only one of these, Brush, had as yet successfully forged ingots of 
acceptable purity. But ablation technology was equally primitive, so plans had 
to be made on dual tracks. Meyer had had much experience with laminated plastics 
for aircraft structures. He had previously learned, in consultations with the 
Cincinnati Testing Laboratory, how to design a "shingle layup" for fabrication 
of an ablation heatshield. While collecting all available information on both 
the ablative plastic and the beryllium industries, Meyer listened to the Big Joe 
project engineers, Aleck C. Bond and Edison M. Fields. They argued for ablation, 
specifically for a fiber glass-phenolic material, as the primary heat protection 
for the astronaut. Before moving to Virginia in February, Meyer consulted on 
weekends with Brush Beryllium in Cleveland, watching its pioneering progress in 
forging ever larger spherical sections of the exotic metal, which is closely 
akin to the precious gem emerald. But Meyer, along with Bond and Fields, grew 
more skeptical [140] of the elegant theoretical deductions that supported the 
case for beryllium. Mercury would have a shallow angle of entry and consequently 
a long heat duration and high total heat; they worried about the possibility 
that any heat sink might "pressure cook" the occupant of the capsule. So Meyer, 
using CTL's shingle concept, perfected his designs for an ablative shield.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-4.htm#source19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>There was something basically appealing about the less tidy ablation 
principle, something related to a basic principle in physics, where the heat 
necessary to change the state (from solid to liquid to gas) of a material is 
vastly greater than the heat absorbed by that material in raising its 
temperature by degrees. Meyer became convinced by March that beryllium would be 
twice as expensive and only half as safe. Consequently, Meyer and Fields 
concentrated their efforts on proving their well-grounded intuition that 
ablation technology could be brought to a workable state before the Big Joe shot 
in early summer.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-4.htm#source20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>While lively technical discussions over ablation versus heat sink continued 
through the spring, the fact that Mercury officials had committed Big Joe to the 
proof-testing of an ablative shield also rather effectively squelched any 
further attempts at scientific comparisons. Whereas in January Paul E. Purser 
recorded that "we will procure both ablation and beryllium shields . . . and 
neither will be 'backup,' they will be 'alternates,'" by the end of April 
technological difficulties in manufacturing the prototype ablation shields 
became so acute as to monopolize the attention of cognizant STG engineers.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-4.htm#source21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>Glennan and Silverstein in Headquarters therefore directed continuation of 
the heat sink development as insurance, while STG gradually consigned the 
alternative beryllium shield to the role of substitute even before the fiber 
glass phenolic shield had proved its worth. By mid-year of 1959, apparently only 
the Brush Beryllium Company still felt confident that the metallic heat sponge 
was a viable alternative to the glass heat vaporizer in protecting the man in 
space from the fate of a meteor. The complicated glass-cloth fabricating and 
curing problems for the ablation shield were mostly conquered by July. John H. 
Winter, the heatshield project coordinator at the Cincinnati Testing Laboratory, 
delivered his first ablation shield to NASA in Cleveland on June 22 under heavy 
guard.<A

<P>The critical question of whether to jettison the heatshield was active early 
in 1959. If the shield were a heat sink, it would be so hot by the time it 
reached the lower atmosphere that to retain it after the main parachute had 
deployed would be hazardous to the pilot. Also in case of a dry landing such a 
hot sponge could easily start a prairie or forest fire. On the other hand, a 
detachable shield would add complexity to the system and increase the risk of 
its loss before performing its reentry job. In one of the early airdrops a 
jettisoned shield actually went into "a falling leaf pattern after detachment. 
It glided back and collided with the capsule, presenting an obvious potential 
hazard for the pilot in his vehicle late in the reentry cycle."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-4.htm#source23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> 
This incident prompted the decision that the heatshield would be retained, 
although it might very well be lowered in the final moments of the flight if it 
could help attenuate impact. The memory of this early collision [141] after 
jettisoning continued to haunt STG engineers until they rejected the beryllium 
heat-sink shield altogether.
<P>Although the heatshield problem was highly debatable at the inception of the 
project, there was consolation in the fact that at least two major development 
areas were virtually complete. The two items considered frozen at the end of 
January 1959 were the external configuration of the capsule, except for the 
antenna section, and the form-fitting couch in which the astronaut would be able 
to endure a force of 20 g or more, if it should come to that.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-4.htm#source24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> 
The Space Task Group was pleased to have something as accomplished fact when so 
many other areas were still full of uncertainties.
<P>To George Low's ninth weekly status report for Administrator Glennan on STG's 
progress and plans for Project Mercury was appended a tabular flight test 
schedule that summarized the program and mission planning as envisioned in 
mid-March 1959. Five Little Joe flights, eight Redstone, two Jupiter, ten Atlas 
flights, and two balloon ascents were scheduled, the categories overlapping each 
other from July 1959 through January 1961. The first manned ballistic suborbital 
flight was designated Mercury-Redstone flight No. 3, or simply "MR-3," to be 
launched about April 26, 1960. And the first manned orbital flight, designated 
Mercury-Atlas No. 7, or "MA-7," was targeted for September 1, 1960. After that, 
STG hoped to fly several more, progressively longer orbital missions, leading 
finally to 18 orbits or a full day for man in space. Although merely a possible 
flight test plan, this schedule set a superhuman pace and formed the basis for 
NASA's earliest expectations.<A
