<H2>(October - December 1958)</H2>[109] "All right. Let's get on with it !"
<P>These were the informal words of leadership that launched the development of 
the United States' first manned space flight program. They were spoken by T. 
Keith Glennan, newly appointed first Administrator of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration, following a briefing by eight civil service 
aeronautical engineers who felt ready to become "astronautical engineers." This 
was exactly a year and three days after national debate and preliminary planning 
had been precipitated by <I>Sputnik I.</I> Glennan's words symbolized the firm 
resolution of the Congress, the Eisenhower administration, and the American 
people to accept the challenge of nature, technology, and the Soviet Union to 
explore the shallows of the universe.<A

<P>By the first anniversary of Earth's first artificial satellite, Americans 
generally seemed willing, if not eager, to accept the rationale of scientific 
experts and engineering enthusiasts that the new ocean of space could now and 
should now be explored by man in person. The human and the physical energies 
necessary for man to venture beyond Earth's atmosphere had become, for the first 
time in the history of this planet, available in feasible form. These energies 
only needed transformation by organization and development to transport man into 
the beyond.
<P>If these were the articles of faith behind the first American manned 
satellite program, they had not been compelling enough to spark action toward 
space flight before the Sputniks. Public furor was inspired primarily not by the 
promise of extending aeronautics and missilery into astronautics, but rather by 
the nationalistic fervor and punctured pride caused by the obviously spectacular 
Soviet achievements. Faith, fervor, and even some fear were perhaps necessary if 
the [110] American democracy was to embark on a significant space program. But 
the people most directly concerned with mobilizing the men and the technology to 
accomplish manned orbital flight had first to organize themselves.

<P><A name=source1><SUP>1</A> </SUP>T. Keith Glennan, in a letter to C. C. A. 
dated Dec. 18, 1963, said he could not recall precisely either the dates or the 
happenings at the meetings during his first official week in office. But he 
added, "It seemed the natural course for me to accept the recommendations of the 
only people who knew very much about the matter and initiate the program as soon 
as NASA became an operating agency. In short, I do not recall that President 
Eisenhower actually assigned the manned space flight program to NASA - I guess I 
just accepted the tasks which we would have to undertake." See also Clotaire 
Wood, interview, Washington, D.C., Sept. 1, 1965, for witness to the words to 
proceed.
