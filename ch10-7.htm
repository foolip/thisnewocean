<H1>MR-BD is not MR-3</H1>In the midst of the restudies of Mercury-Redstone 
reliability in early February, Wernher von Braun talked with his chief of public 
information, Bart J. Slattery, Jr., about the way the public had been 
"conditioned" to believe that the Mercury astronaut would not be allowed to ride 
the vehicle until 100 percent assurance of his safe return was obtained from 
testing. "There isn't such a thing!" proclaimed von Braun, and he added that 
future publicity releases should emphasize that there "<I>is a risk</I>," 
perhaps greater than the traffic risks Americans take every day but possibly no 
greater than test pilots take with maiden flights of new jet aircraft.<A

<P>During the following month, while trying to reduce that risk to a minimum, 
the von Braun team represented by Slattery, the Space Task Group represented by 
John A. Powers, and NASA Headquarters represented by Paul P. Haney, agreed to 
plan the public information for MR-BD to avoid "over-emphasis or overly 
optimistic assumptions relating to future manned flights."<A

<P>Redstone engineers meanwhile quickly fixed the MR-BD launch vehicle, making 
their seven technical changes during the first two weeks in March 1961. The 
foremost cause of previous Redstone booster overaccelerations was a small servo 
control valve that had failed to regulate properly the flow of hydrogen peroxide 
to the steam generator, which in turn powered, and in the case of MR-1A and MR-2 
overpowered, the fuel pumps. Modifications were made to the thrust regulator and 
velocity integrator, in hopes that MR-BD would be physically incapable of 
exceeding the speed limit again. Another technical difficulty had been some 
harmonic vibrations induced by aerodynamic stress in the topmost section of the 
elongated Redstone. Four stiffeners were added to the ballast section and 210 
pounds of insulation was applied to the inner skin of the upper part of the 
instrument compartment. Although oscillations at the second bending mode 
frequencies were less on MR-2 than on MR-1A, several other electronic changes 
were made to reduce the dangers from noise and vibration. [329] High winds aloft 
probably had added some extra stress in the former case, but in any event the 
next trajectory would smooth out the tilting maneuver in the region of high 
dynamic pressure, and 65 telemetry sensors were placed where the rocket's 
bending moments needed to be monitored. Finally, after a great deal of 
diagnostic study, five resettings were made to ensure that the booster engine 
cutoff time would not precede oxidizer depletion and hence cause another 
premature abort signal, as had happened with MR-2. All these changes proceeded 
smoothly while the boilerplate capsule was ballasted and corrugated to 
approximate the production model, McDonnell spacecraft No. 7, and fitted with an 
inert escape rocket. The capsule did not have a posi-retrorocket package.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm#source75"><SUP>75</A></SUP>
<P>On the morning of March 24, 1961, the second half of the split countdown for 
MR-BD was in progress, and so far everything had proceeded without a hitch or a 
"glitch." To test procedures for the launch pad rescue crews, a manned M-113 
armored personnel carrier was parked only 1,000 feet southwest of the unmanned 
Redstone. The firemen in this vehicle were going to endure bone-jangling noise 
and vibration during the launch to see how much emergency rescue crews could 
stand. Closer still, an unmanned asbestos-covered truck was [330] parked 65 feet 
from the MR-BD blast deflector to simulate the position that the "cherry 
picker," or mobile egress tower, would occupy during the launch of a manned 
missile.
<P>Liquid oxygen loading for MR-BD began only two hours before the scheduled 
launch time. During the automatically controlled loading process, winds of about 
20 knots swayed the Redstone and produced sloshing during the "topoff" 
operation. The fuel temperature began to rise toward the boiling point, and soon 
an overflow bled out the booster standpipe and boil-off valve. This potentially 
dangerous situation was governed by a computer, which, when its electronic bias 
in the topping circuit was lowered, continued the "lox- topping" normally. No 
holds were called, and the countdown proceeded to launch without further 
incident.
<P>At 12:30 p.m., MR-BD lifted off straight and smooth from Cape Canaveral on 
its programmed trajectory. The people in the armored vehicle on the ground 
watched it all without discomfort, and a truck driver later moved the simulated 
"cherry picker" away undamaged. Although the actual exit velocity was 89 feet 
per second higher than planned, there was in general, said Hammack in his report 
to STG, "hardly a plotting difference between the actual trajectory data 
computed . . . and the nominal trajectory published in NASA working paper 
178."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm#source76"><SUP>76</A></SUP> 
The whole configuration impacted in the Atlantic 307 miles downrange (five miles 
short of the plan) and sank to the bottom, exploding a sofar bomb en route. 
MR-BD was highly successful; as George Low reported to Administrator Webb, it 
"demonstrated that all major booster problems have been eliminated."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm#source77"><SUP>77</A></SUP> 
Telemetry revealed that the Redstone still wriggled a bit with high vibrations 
in the instrument compartment, but all the "quick-fixes" had worked properly. 
MR-BD satisfied von Braun's team, Debus' crew, and all of NASA that the Redstone 
was now trustworthy enough to be called "man-rated." Enough experience was at 
hand to tackle the next step in Project Mercury, manned suborbital flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm#source78"><SUP>78</A></SUP>
<P>But the very next day, March 25, the Soviets announced the successful launch 
and recovery of their fifth <I>Korabl Sputnik</I>, containing a dog named 
Zvesdochka, or Little Star. Three out of five was their record now for 
successful recovery of "cosmic ships" and dogs from orbit. Three days later, at 
a Soviet Academy of Science press conference in Moscow, six of Strelka's pups, 
as well as four other space dogs, were on exhibit as evidence and harbingers of 
the imminent flight of man into space. MR-BD might have been that first flight 
had it been "MR-3," as originally scheduled, but the decision of a month before 
froze the Mercury-Redstone schedule for at least two months afterward. And the 
Mercury team, aware of but not dominated by the space race, could only hope that 
the "Sputnik Spacecraft Team" was having comparable final checkout difficulties.
<P>At the beginning of April 1961, Mercury-Redstone launch vehicle No. 7 was 
erected on its launch pedestal at pad No. 5 and made ready for the first mating 
of the man-rated capsule No. 7. Feverish activity pervaded Hangar S and the 
[331] service structure, where another "white room" was being hastily rigged on 
the third level of the gantry at MR-3's capsule height. Rework on the capsule's 
reaction control system was completed during the first week in April, while the 
three chosen astronauts went through final procedures training and acceleration 
conditioning in centrifuge runs at Johnsville. The Space Task Group now believed 
that the development phase of the project was practically over. Symbolizing this 
shift, the Associate Director responsible for development, Charles Donlan, left 
STG formally on the first of April to return to Langley Research Center, leaving 
Walter Williams, the operations chief, as Gilruth's sole Associate Director.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm#source79"><SUP>79</A></SUP>
<P>The Space Task Group nevertheless could not afford to become too preoccupied 
with the preparations for MR-3 because MA-3 and Little Joe 5B were scheduled 
first, and within two weeks, as prerequisites for the orbital objective. On 
April 10, foreign correspondents in Moscow reported rampant rumors sweeping the 
city that the U.S.S.R. had placed a man into space. That same day at Langley 
Field, Virginia, another rumor reached the attention of STG to the effect that 
the 10 members and four consultants of the President's Hornig panel were 
recommending at least 50 more chimpanzee runs before putting man in space. 
Gilruth remarked facetiously that if this were true, the Mercury program ought 
to move to Africa.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm#source80"><SUP>80</A></SUP>
<P>This hearsay recommendation did not become a part of the "Report of the Ad 
Hoc Mercury Panel" or of the Hornig Committee, as it was more widely known, 
which was submitted on April 12, 1961. Having been delegated by President 
Kennedy and his scientific adviser, Wiesner, the panel visited the McDonnell 
plant, Cape Canaveral, and Langley Field and talked with representatives of 
supporting services and contractors. In its 18-page report it reviewed the 
accomplishments and failures of the Mercury program, assessed the risks and 
probability of success, and commented upon medical aspects of Project Mercury as 
a whole and medical readiness for manned suborbital flight in particular. It 
concluded with some reasonable medical reservations that a Redstone flight now 
would be "a high risk undertaking but not higher than we are accustomed to 
taking in other ventures," such as in the initial flights of the Wright 
Brothers, Lindbergh, and the X-series of research aircraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm#source81"><SUP>81</A></SUP>
<P>In its reliability assessments, the Hornig panel graded the Mercury 
subsystems or components according to three classes of reliability percentages: 
Class 1, 95-100 percent; Class 2, 85-95 percent; Class 3, 70-85 percent. Eleven 
items were rated as Class 1: Capsule structure and reentry properties; 
separation mechanism and posigrade rocket; tower and abort rockets; voice 
communications; abort sensing instrumentation system; manual control system; 
retrorocket system; parachute landing system; ground environment system; 
recovery operation; and pilot training. Three items were rated in Class 2: 
Landing bag; environmental control system; and automatic stabilization and 
control system. The two items in the Class 3 category, booster (Redstone or 
Atlas) and telemetry, were explained as "not per se a cause for alarm" for pilot 
safety but only for mission success.<A
