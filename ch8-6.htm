<H1>Management Learns Its Limits</H1>The astronauts were not alone in their need 
to become in some sense machine-rated. The managers of Mercury, both the civil 
servants and the contractors, had found truth in the maxim of industrial 
management that short-term estimates of accomplishment are nearly always 
overestimated. Mercury, like virtually all contractual development programs, 
entailed inherent technical and administrative difficulties impossible to 
foresee. A corollary to the rule of short-term estimates, namely that long-term 
predictions of accomplishments are very often underestimated, offered little 
solace at this stage of the development of Project Mercury. In its fifth status 
report at the end of January 1960, the Space Task Group related to Headquarters 
some of the lessons learned during its first year of contractual operations: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>A new capsule delivery schedule has recently been indicated by 
  McDonnell to reflect a delay in delivery of over 3 months in the early 
  capsules. This revision was made necessary by a realistic appraisal of 
  progress to date. Although various proposals for improving the situation have 
  been considered, there does not seem to be any practical avenue open at this 
  time for effecting any worthwhile change.
  <P>[251] Because of these delays and the fact that it has not been possible to 
  substantiate the shingle structure adequately on the ground, it has been 
  decided to cancel the vibration program on capsule No. 4 and instead to fit 
  this capsule with an absolute minimum of equipment and instrumentation and to 
  fire it on an Atlas as MA-1 . . . at the earliest practicable date.<A

Charles J. Donlan, and their younger associates in STG grew older rapidly during 
their first 15 months as a contracting agency. Gradually attaining more 
autonomy, the Space Task Group still expected eventually to move to Beltsville, 
Maryland. But in February NASA Headquarters made clear its intention not to move 
STG until Project Mercury was essentially completed. Relations with the Langley 
Research Center, STG's parent organization, improved markedly with better 
organizational arrangements, such as job order procedures, and with the growth 
of STG's own administrative staff. Close working exchanges still prevailed in 
many areas, especially with the Langley shopmen under Jack A. Kinzler providing 
technical services. But on STG's first birthday, only two out of Langley's 12 
applied research divisions could still say with regard to Mercury that "there is 
as much to be done as has been done."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
<P>The Pilotless Aircraft Research Division (PARD), renamed the Applied 
Materials and Physics Division at the end of 1959, and the Instrument Research 
Division were still most actively supporting Mercury.
<P>During STG's infant year, overall Langley support amounted to well over 100 
separate preliminary data releases, contributed by more than 325 professional 
people, and costing approximately $1.9 million of Langley's own appropriations. 
STG's personnel complement in January 1960 was climbing above 500; the total 
cost of the prime contract with McDonnell, already modified in about 120 
particulars, was approaching $70 million and rising. At the same time, McDonnell 
estimated that more than half its total effort on Project Mercury was still in 
engineering development; a third of its effort was on actual production; and 
about 10 percent was on tooling. According to McDonnell's assistant contract 
manager, the overall weighted percentage of contract completion was just below 
60 percent.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source61"><SUP>61</A></SUP>
<P>The magnitude of monitoring a contract of this size was reflected in another 
reorganization of the Space Task Group in mid-January. Formalized in the new 
block chart were the personnel office under Burney H. Goodwin, a budget and 
finance office under J. P. Donovan, a procurement and supply office under Glenn 
F. Bailey, and an administrative services office under Guy W. Boswick, Jr. STG 
simplified its three line divisions by making James A. Chamberlin chief of its 
"Engineering Division" instead of the "Engineering and Contract Administration 
Division." Under Chamberlin, Andre J. Meyer, Jr., and Norman F. Smith served as 
assistant chief and executive engineer, respectively. In Faget's Flight Systems 
Division, Robert O. Piland and J. T. Markley were confirmed in their posts as 
assistant chief and executive engineer.
<P>At this time Faget unofficially set Robert Piland to work considering 
advanced [252] vehicles suitable for a circumlunar space flight. This 
soft-spoken Virginian had turned from mathematics to aeronautical engineering in 
1947 and had served as technical assistant to James T. Killian and the 
President's Science Advisory Committee during 1958. Technically able and 
politically experienced, Piland directed the circumlunar pilot studies for four 
months before authorization for an advanced vehicle team on May 25, 1960, 
formally added eight other senior STG engineers to look to the future beyond 
Mercury.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source62"><SUP>62</A></SUP>
<P>Robert Piland also learned something from his older brother, Joseph V. Piland, 
assistant head of the contracts and scheduling office, who had evolved from a 
mechanical engineer into a contract administrator. Joseph Piland was 
instrumental in smoothing STG's formal relationships with its industrial 
contractors. His counterpart in McDonnell's organization was C. F. Picard, and 
together they had now to supervise over 50 subcontractors and over 5,000 
sub-subcontractors.
<P>Charles Mathews' Operations Division was in a state of flux as he and Walter 
C. Williams shuffled men and positions in preparation for manned operations. 
Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., and Chris C. Critzos stayed put, while G. Merritt 
Preston went to the Cape and Scott H. Simpkinson was sent to St. Louis to help 
expedite matters at McDonnell. Other names on the STG organization chart of 
January 11, 1960, filled staff positions alongside Purser, Kenneth S. 
Kleinknecht, and Martin A. Byrnes. Another assistant to the director was Raymond 
L. Zavasky; heading the technical services liaison with Langley was Kinzler. The 
military officers originally assigned to STG as liaison remained aboard and 
active. They were Colonel Keith G. Lindell of the Air Force, who doubled as head 
of the astronaut and training section; Lieutenant Colonel Martin L. Raines of 
the Army; and Commander Paul L. Havenstein of the Navy. Even Langley Research 
Center, across the field, had its liaison man on STG's staff: W. Kemble 
Johnson.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source63"><SUP>63</A></SUP>
<P>Beginning in January 1960, plans were made to integrate the astronaut with a 
flight-control team as well as with his machine. Team training of the 
remote-site ground crews required an extensive familiarization and orientation 
program. The initial proposal for training these teams began with an admonition: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is essential that the training of the flight control personnel 
  be closely integrated with that of the astronaut's. As long as the astronaut 
  is conscious all ground commands must be executed through or with the 
  concurrence of the pilot. To be effective, the pilot and the ground crew must 
  work as a closely knit team. An efficient system is dependent upon adequate 
  team training and development of mutual confidence.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source64"><SUP>64</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>In 
preparing to train and integrate the flight-control team for final operations, 
Walter Williams first discussed the problem with Kurt H. Debus, the Director of 
ABMA's Missile Firing Laboratory, and Major General Donald N. Yates, the Defense 
Department's representative and Commander of the Air Force Missile Test Center 
at Patrick Air Force Base, near Cape Canaveral. [253] Manned missile operations 
were as new to them as to him, so on January 18, Williams wrote letters to each 
of these gentlemen formally proposing the establishment of new coordination 
committees for the upcoming flight tests. NASA Headquarters meanwhile had 
appointed another Air Force missile expert, Major General Don R. Ostrander, as 
Director of an Office of Launch Vehicles. His appointment, it was felt, would 
help interservice cooperation and relieve Silverstein of management 
responsibility for rocket development.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source65"><SUP>65</A></SUP>
<P>In February Mathews and Williams organized a Launch Operations Branch within 
STG's Operations Division under Preston at the Cape. Then they specified the 
duties, organization, and responsibilities of the Mercury launch coordination 
office. Approaching a phase of heavy operational activity, different in kind as 
well as degree from Edwards and Wallops Island field operations, Williams and 
Mathews appointed Christopher Kraft as flight director, Stanley White as chief 
flight surgeon, Merritt Preston as launch operations manager, and Scott 
Simpkinson as capsule operations manager. By early March, 32 other position 
titles for ground operations - in the Mercury Control Center, in the blockhouse, 
at Atlantic Missile Range Central Control, and in the launch pad area - were 
specified. Capsule engineers at the Cape published quickly a thick "Manual for 
Launch Operations," which indicated their readiness to assume responsibility for 
launch operations. Williams also asked Destroyer Flotilla Four to plan for the 
recovery of MA-1 toward the end of May.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source66"><SUP>66</A></SUP>
<P>If Debus and Yates were somewhat chagrined by the forceful speed and decision 
exhibited by Williams and Mathews in setting NASA firmly in control of launching 
operations, they were not alone in worrying about the future. Within other 
divisions of the Space Task Group there was also some worry lest the operations 
division should monopolize participation in the payoff phase of Project Mercury. 
William Bland, for instance, wrote a memo to Maxime Faget early in March urging 
that "the specialists who have matured with Project Mercury" not be diverted to 
advanced vehicular planning before getting a chance to prove in flight the 
systems they had designed: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>As Project Mercury matures, the total workload with the Space Task 
  Group will increase with the greatest portion of the load carried by the 
  operations division. This change in relative work does not mean that personnel 
  of the flight systems division should decrease their participation in the 
  project. Actually personnel of the flight systems division, at this particular 
  time, have a much wider and deeper range of experience in preparations for 
  launchings, in launchings of rocket vehicles, and in flight data analysis than 
  the Mercury launch personnel (NASA and MAC). This experience in detailed 
  knowledge which was collected during the Little Joe and Big Joe flight 
  programs, the beach abort tests, the different system development programs 
  (such as those conducted on escape motors, pyrotechnics, parachutes, drogue 
  chutes, controls, etc.), and in the development of individual components which 
  make up the capsule system, must be available to the Space Task Group 
  organization conducting launch operations in order to insure direct approach 
  to <I>successful launchings</I>.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source67"><SUP>67</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>[254] 
Bland expressed to Faget his concern about the possibility of being preempted 
from participation in Mercury operations. Faget, restlessly pursuing his first 
loves of conceptual design and initial development, first for Mercury and now 
for something soon to be called "Apollo," was in danger of losing the support of 
some of his lieutenants unless the Flight Systems Division got some role in the 
flying of their systems.
<P>Part of this disaffection had been precipitated by a major meeting regarding 
the Mercury network, held on February 9 at Langley. Ostensibly this meeting was 
to discuss the operational organization, maintenance and operations training, 
and communications for the network. About 30 men from the Air Force, Navy, 
Western Electric, Bendix Radio, the oceanic missile ranges, and the Tracking 
Unit at Langley met with Williams, Mathews, Kraft, and John D. Hodge, but no 
representative of the Flight Systems Division was present. A week later Gilruth 
appointed the flight controllers and set C. Frederick Matthews, a Canadian whose 
name was often confused with that of his chief, Charles W. Mathews, in charge of 
coordinating the ground crew training programs. Walter Williams saw this as a 
full-time job in itself. By the first of March flight controller indoctrination 
and training plans were underway, and Philco contractors and medical monitors 
were being briefed for a larger role at various ground sites whenever their 
training should warrant.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source68"><SUP>68</A></SUP>
<P>In mid-March Faget confronted another problem in machine-rating his 
technicians when he received another technical complaint, this one from William 
A. Petynia, a conscientious engineer he had assigned to watch complete systems 
tests of capsule No. 1. Petynia had been working with McDonnell project engineer 
A. M. Paolini since June 1959, preparing capsule No. 1 for the beach-abort 
launch from Wallops. But the complicated, specialized knowledge required to do a 
faultless job seemed to Petynia to be overwhelming by the spring of 1960: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>To determine the "overall picture" is not difficult, but I found 
  additional effort was required to be in a position to even partially 
  understand capsule systems. I do not mean to become a specialist in each of 
  the capsule systems, but I wanted to be able to recognize and understand 
  problems and their relationship with the flight.
  <P>The flight systems capsule engineer is the one person in the test 
  organization who clearly understands the flight test objectives and the 
  performance of the hardware in order to fulfill them. This I think is 
  important! However, I think that due to the complexity of the capsule, the 
  engineer cannot hope to become familiar with the hardware to any great degree 
  in the short period before CST [Capsule Systems Test]. I believe that training 
  classes for the engineers [should] be started immediately under MAC's 
  supervision.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source69"><SUP>69</A></SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Petynia's 
awareness of the necessity to machine-rate himself so he could do an adequate 
job of inspection was one individual manifestation within STG of the problem of 
getting all the million or so people involved to do a perfect job in order to 
man-rate all the machines. From the highest level to the lowest, [255] 
supervisors sought better methods to inspire the men at work on Mercury to make 
the quest for reliability a personal matter.
<P>One of the methods used to good effect was identification, both of parts and 
of workers in the project. The Redstone managers had adopted in 1959 a seal 
showing the anthropomorphic god Mercury in winged cap and boots bearing a 
missile and vaulting Earth. Atlas managers eventually selected the alchemical 
and astrological symbol for Mercury, enclosing a blue "R" for reliability, as 
their identifying label for Mercury-Atlas components and laborers. On personnel 
badges, these marks of distinction meant a record of highest performance, but on 
hardware these decals signified a test record that came closest to the nominal 
design desiderata. Machines or components that performed too well in certain 
respects were suspect as possible troublemakers in other respects for the 
future.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source70"><SUP>70</A></SUP>
<P>The astronauts were now making periodic appearances along the production 
lines at McDonnell, Chrysler, Convair/Astronautics, and elsewhere to encourage 
the highest standards of craftsmanship among even apprentices or semiskilled 
workers handling or processing any components that bore the Mercury decal. 
Having shaken the hand of one of the pilots whose life depended on their work, 
the factory workers presumably would treat with the greatest care and tenderness 
the parts then still in their hands.
<P>Credit for having first worked out the guidelines for a coherent plan to 
machine-rate everybody probably should go to Bernhard A. Hohmann and Ernst R. 
Letsch of Space Technology Laboratories (STL) and later of Aerospace 
Corporation. Together with Major General Osmond J. Ritland, former test pilot in 
command of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, Hohmann assured the 
astronauts that their interests would never be sacrificed. Hohmann's study of 
the "General Aspects of the Pilot Safety Program for Project Mercury Atlas 
Boosters" analyzed the differences between the ideas of reliability, quality 
control, and quality assurance before synthesizing them in a specific program 
adaptable to other areas of Mercury development. Hohmann combined the approaches 
of the mathematicians and systems engineers at STL with the viewpoints of 
production, inspection, and test engineers at Convair/Astronautics, Rocketdyne, 
and elsewhere.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source71"><SUP>7l</A></SUP> 
But some of the compromises he recommended, such as choosing most nominal 
instead of highest performance parts to assure a higher level of final quality, 
were appropriated only gradually by NASA and STG.
<P>Upgrading the intensity of quality control over raw materials, of inspections 
and tests of systems integration in the plant, and of the requirements for a 
complete vehicle at the time of the "factory rollout" were significant parts of 
the pilot safety program. In the final analysis for flight readiness, a Flight 
Safety Review Board, patterned on Air Force practice, should take the technical 
responsibility for certifying the booster to be man-rated.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-6.htm#source72"><SUP>72</A></SUP> 
Even after all these precautions there was always going to be an element of 
doubt. Procedural principles on paper would require two more years - and at 
least five flight experiments - to become realized in practice and working 
habits. 
<P>

<P><A name=source59><SUP>59</A> </SUP>"Status Report No. 5," STG, 2. This status 
report continued on the next page with these significant remarks:
<P>"It has also been found possible to make the configuration of the capsules 
for MR-2 . . . and MR-3 identical. The missions of these capsules remain 
unchanged. However, in order for the basic capsules to be identical, the 
quantities to be recorded for the primate carried in MR-2 must remain the same 
as those to be recorded for the man in MR-3. The advantage of making these 
capsules identical is that otherwise the first manned flight would have been in 
a capsule that differed in several respects from those that had been fired 
previously. Now there will be at least one firing of an identical capsule before 
inserting a man.
<P>"The operations required for preparation and launch of the capsule have 
received very careful study, and it has been concluded that these operations 
will require much more time than was previously estimated. The resultant program 
with the delayed capsule deliveries was, however, felt to be unacceptable. For 
this reason, new, rather optimistic target times have been set for the checkout 
and launch period, and a study has been instituted to see whether these 
schedules can be met by careful planning of the work and facility utilization 
and by extra work shifts. The effects of all these factors are being considered 
in formulating a new schedule."
