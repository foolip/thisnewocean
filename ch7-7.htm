<H1>Little Joe Series</H1>While the results of the Big Joe launch were being 
studied, a five-man investigating committee at Langley was trying to learn why 
the first Little Joe shot, on August 21, 1959, had miscarried so badly. Out at 
Wallops Island that Friday morning several weeks earlier, the first Little Joe 
(LJ-1) had sat on its launcher, tilted toward the sea, with a full-sized model 
capsule and escape system on top. Its test mission was to determine how well the 
escape rocket would function under the most severe dynamic loading conditions 
anticipated during a Mercury-Atlas launching. At 35 minutes before launch, 
evacuation of the area had been proceeding on schedule, and the batteries for 
the programmer and destruct system in the test booster were being charged. 
Suddenly, half an hour before launchtime, an explosive flash and roar startled 
several photographers and crewmen into diving for cover.
<P>No one was injured, but when the smoke cleared it was evident that only the 
capsule-and-tower combination had been launched, on a trajectory similar to an 
off-the-pad abort. The booster and adapter-clamp ring remained intact on the 
launcher. Near apogee, at about 2000 feet, the clamping ring that held tower to 
capsule released and the little pyro-rocket for jettisoning the tower fired.<A

<P>The accident report on LJ-1, issued on September 18, blamed the premature 
firing of the Grand Central escape rocket on an electrical leak, or what missile 
engineers were calling "transients," "ghost" voltages or currents, or simply a 
"glitch" in a relay circuit. The fault was found in a coil. It had been 
specially designed as a positive redundancy to protect biological specimens from 
too rapid an abort and as a negative redundancy to prevent inadvertent 
destruction of the test booster. Again the problem of upgrading the machines to 
provide safety for animal payloads as well as to ensure mission success had 
created unexpected problems. This first trial of the brand-new Little Joe test 
booster apparently had been too ambitious. Fortunately the momentum of the 
Little Joe test series was not disturbed by the debacle of the boilerplate 
payload on Little Joe No. 1.
<P>[209] North American Aviation finished and shipped on September 25, 1959, its 
sixth and last airframe for the Little Joe booster as promised. The Space Task 
Group therefore had available at the beginning of October all the Little Joe 
test boosters it had ordered. Designed primarily to man-rate the escape system 
operating from a Mercury-Atlas already in flight, the Little Joe booster also 
was committed to perform some biological research before fulfilling its primary 
mission.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source85"><SUP>85</A></SUP>
<P>More by coincidence than by design, the next three Little Joe boosters were 
launched from Wallops Island exactly one month apart in the autumn of 1959. 
Still the primary aerodynamic test objectives remained unfulfilled. But the 
fourth shot, in January 1960, finally worked precisely as planned. STG was 
satisfied that its own pilot safety provisions were viable under the worst 
possible aerodynamic conditions. The same kind of test on McDonnell's finished 
product, rather than on boilerplate demonstration capsules, perhaps could be 
made the following summer.
<P>On October 4, 1959, the same booster that had been jilted by the capsule and 
escape rocket in August was finally fired, this time with a double dummy - an 
uninstrumented boilerplate model fitted with an inert escape rocket system. 
After the fiasco of LJ- 1, the more modest purpose of this test, which later 
became known as Little Joe 6 (LJ-6), was to prove the "reliability" of the whole 
booster propulsion cluster. All four Pollux motors, plus four smaller Recruit 
motors, were set to fire in sequence. Little Joe 6, 55 feet tall and weighing 20 
tons at liftoff, blasted up to a peak altitude barely short of 40 miles; then it 
was intentionally destroyed after two and a half minutes of flight to prove the 
destruct system. Impact was over 70 miles from Wallops Island. All went well.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source86"><SUP>86</A></SUP>
<P>Satisfied that Little Joe had proved itself as a booster, the supervisory 
team of NASA engineers, consisting of John C. Palmer from Wallops, and Roland 
English, James Mayo, Clifford Nelson, Charles McFall of Langley, and William M. 
Bland and Robert O. Piland of the Space Task Group, prepared for a new effort to 
check the correct operation of the abort escape system at maximum loading 
conditions. The region called "max q" (for maximum dynamic pressure) by 
aerodynamicists is the portion of the flight path at which relative speed 
between the vehicle and the atmosphere produces the greatest air resistance on 
the vehicle. Many variables were involved, but roughly both Little Joe and the 
Mercury-Atlas were expected to experience dynamic pressures of almost 1,000 
pounds per square foot at an approximate altitude of six miles after about one 
minute of flight time.
<P>For the second attempt at this primary mission, Little Joe 1-A (LJ-1A) needed 
to propel another dummy capsule and pylon to the max q region. Both drogue and 
main parachute behavior were to be carefully studied on this flight. Surprised 
by the insistent demands from the news media to witness these developmental 
flight tests, STG gave the press a careful enumeration of situations that might 
call for a "hold" or a "scratch" of the shot.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source87"><SUP>87</A></SUP>
<P>On November 4, 1959, when the second Little Joe booster was successfully 
launched, newspapermen could see nothing wrong. The flight looked straight and 
[210] true until the rocket was out of sight. But the test engineers in the 
control center observed that the escape motor did not fire until 10 seconds 
after the point of maximum dynamic pressure. The parachutes and recovery 
operations performed well enough to fulfill secondary and tertiary objectives, 
but precisely why escape was too slow was never fully understood. Later analysis 
showed only that the delayed ignition of the escape rocket caused the separation 
of capsule from booster at a pressure only one-tenth of that programmed.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source88"><SUP>88</A></SUP> 
Because the next scheduled launch of a Little Joe booster was already committed 
to a test for certain aeromedical objectives and was now in a late stage of 
preparation, the primary aerodynamic test of the escape system was postponed 
until January, when a third try, to be called Little Joe 1-B, could be made.
<P>Back in May, STG had begun planning with the Air Force School of Aviation 
Medicine to include some biological packages in later Little Joe flights. The 
booster designated No. 5 was reserved specifically to qualify all systems in the 
McDonnell capsule, carrying a chimpanzee occupant and escaping from a simulated 
Atlas explosion at the point of max q.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source89"><SUP>89</A></SUP>
<P>After the disappointment of Little Joe 1-A, Donlan, Bland, and Piland decided 
to pull out the stops on Little Joe 2 and allow the aeromedical specialists to 
run all the experiments they wanted on a high-powered flight. The School of 
Aviation Medicine had made ready a biological package for its primate passenger, 
a small rhesus monkey named "Sam," after his alma mater. In addition to Sam's 
special capsule for rocket flight, the military physicians now prepared barley 
seeds, rat nerve cells, neurospora, tissue cultures, and insect packets to 
measure the effects of primary radiation, changes in appearance and capacity for 
reproduction, and ova and larvae responses to the space environment.
<P>Little Joe 2 promised to be a spectacular flight if everything went as 
planned. The engineers could see how the capsule escape system would function 
under conditions of high mach number and low dynamic pressure; more important 
technically, they could measure the motions, aerodynamic loads, and aerodynamic 
heating experience of the capsule entering from the intermediate height of about 
70 miles. The Air Force medical specialists might also learn about other things, 
but their chief interest was to see how well Sam himself would withstand 
weightlessness during the trip. This was also the chief interest of Alan B. 
Shepard and Virgil I. Grissom, who came to see this launch.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source90"><SUP>90</A></SUP>
<P>On December 4, 1959, just before noon, the third Little Joe, LJ-2, ripped 
through the air under full power and burned out at an altitude of 100,000 feet. 
The tower and capsule separated as planned and the escape rocket gave an 
additional boost, throwing the capsule into a coasting trajectory that reached 
its zenith just short of 280,000 feet, or 53 miles. This peak height was about 
100,000 feet lower than expected because of a serious windage error, so Sam 
experienced only three minutes of weightlessness instead of four. He survived 
the mild reentry, the not-so-mild impact, and six hours of confinement before he 
was recovered by a destroyer and liberated from his inner envelope.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source91"><SUP>91</A></SUP>
<P>[212] All preliminary indications reflected a highly successful flight. For 
the first time Little Joe had achieved full success on all three orders of its 
programmed test objectives. Congratulatory letters sped around the circuit among 
those responsible. It was a satisfying way to close out the year. But STG 
engineers knew that this full-performance test of the Little Joe was not the 
most crucial case for man-rating the Mercury escape system. They still had to 
prove that at max q, where everything conspired to produce failure, the escape 
system could be relied upon to save the life of any man who ventured into this 
region aboard an Atlas.
<P>Later evaluations of Little Joe 2 were somewhat less sanguine. Biologists 
were disappointed: although results were better than on any previous biological 
space flight, they were still not good enough. STG engineers still awaited the 
more crucial test of the escape system under maximum aerodynamic stress. And the 
Mercury managers were disappointed at the way the news media had dramatized the 
animal experiments at the expense of the equally significant demonstration of 
technological progress.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source92"><SUP>92</A></SUP>
<P>Public information officers John A. Powers of STG and E. Harry Kolcum of NASA 
Headquarters tried to correct the "misplaced emphasis" in the news stories 
before the fourth Little Joe shot, Little Joe 1-B, occurred in January. By this 
time, Gilruth wished the press would note "the relatively minor role of this 
particular task in the context of the total Mercury program."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source93"><SUP>93</A></SUP> 
But again, to the reporters the star of the event was "Miss Sam," the female 
counterpart to the occupant of LJ-2, whose life was at stake and whose nervous 
system was to be tested in psychomotor performance tasks during the short but 
severe flight. Some of the newsmen perhaps knew or divined that several of the 
astronauts wanted to ride one of the next Little Joes into space.
<P>Finally, on January 21, 1960, with the fourth launching of the Little Joe 
series, the escape system performed as planned at the point of max q.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source94"><SUP>94</A></SUP> 
Propelled by two Pollux main motors, Little Joe 1-B blasted up to the nominal 
altitude of slightly less than nine miles and attained a maximum velocity 
slightly over 2,000 miles per hour. Then the escape rocket kicked on the 
overdrive for an additional 250 feet in one second to "rescue" the Mercury 
replica from a simulated booster failure at that point. Over a range of 11.5 
miles out to sea, Miss Sam, in her biopack prepared by medical technicians from 
Brooks Air Force Base and its School of Aviation Medicine, not only survived 
these severe g loads but also performed well (except for a 30-second lapse) at 
her business of watching for the light and pulling the lever. After 8.5 minutes 
of flight, during which the sequence system and capsule landing systems worked 
perfectly, Miss Sam touched down. She was recovered almost immediately by a 
Marine helicopter, and was returned in excellent condition to Wallops Station 
within 45 minutes after liftoff.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source95"><SUP>95</A></SUP>
<P>For half a minute after the escape rocket fired, the little rhesus monkey had 
been badly shaken up and did not respond to stimuli, but otherwise Miss Sam 
acted the role of the perfectly trained primate automaton throughout the flight. 
[213] Evidence of nystagmus after escape rocket firing and after impact on the 
water did cause concern, for it suggested that an astronaut's effectiveness as a 
backup to the parachute system might be impaired. The internal noise level 
proved to be higher than expected, likewise causing some other worries over the 
provisions for communications and pilot comfort.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source96"><SUP>96</A></SUP>
<P>To this point, the Little Joe series of five actual and attempted flights had 
expended four of the six test boosters North American had made for NASA and five 
prototype capsules made in the Langley shops. The primary test objectives for 
these solid-fuel-boosted models were an integral part of the development flight 
program conducted within NASA by the Space Task Group, with Langley and Wallops 
support. Now only two Little Joe boosters remained for the qualification flight 
tests. North American had manufactured seven Little Joe airframes, but one of 
these had been retained at the plant in Downey, California, for static loading 
tests. STG ordered the refurbishment of this seventh airframe so as to have 
three Little Joe boosters for the qualification flight program. The success of 
Little Joe 1-B in January 1960 meant that the next flight, the sixth, to be 
known as LJ-5, would be the first to fly a real Mercury capsule from the 
McDonnell production line.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-7.htm#source97"><SUP>97</A></SUP> 
In passing from development flight tests with boilerplate models to 
qualification flight tests with the "real McDonnell" capsule, the Space Task 
Group moved further away from research into development and toward operations.
