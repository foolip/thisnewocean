<H1>Jockeying for Position</H1>On October 9, only five days after <I>Sputnik 
I</I>, the Ad Hoc Committee of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board urged the 
development of "second generation" ICBMs that could be used as space boosters, 
proposed the eventual accomplishment of manned lunar missions by the Air Force, 
and recommended the launching of Air Force satellites for reconnaissance, 
communications, and weather prediction purposes as soon as possible. A few days 
later, Secretary of the Air Force James H. Douglas appointed a committee of 56 
academic and corporate scientists and Air Force officers, headed by the eminent 
but controversial nuclear physicist Edward N. Teller, to "propose a line of 
positive action" for the Air Force in space exploration. Not surprisingly, the 
Teller Committee in its report of October 28 recommended a unified space program 
under Air Force leadership.<A

<P>Then, on December 10, 1957, Lieutenant General Donald L. Putt, Air Force 
Deputy Chief of Staff, Development, set up a "Directorate of Astronautics" for 
the Air Force. Brigadier General Homer A. Boushey, who sixteen years earlier had 
piloted the first rocket-assisted aircraft takeoff in this country, became head 
of the new office. The move quickly met opposition from Secretary of Defense 
Neil H. McElroy, who was chary about any of the services using the term 
"astronautics," and from William M. Holaday, newly appointed Defense Department 
Director of Guided Missiles, whom the <I>New York Times </I>quoted as charging 
that the Air Force wanted to "see if it can grab the limelight and establish a 
position." The furor within the Defense Department caused Putt to cancel the 
astronautics directorate on December 13, only three days after its 
establishment.<A

<P><I>Sputnik II</I>, the dismayingly large, dog-carrying Soviet satellite, had 
gone into orbit on November 3. As the mood of national confusion intensified in 
the last weeks of 1957, Headquarters USAF ordered the Air Research and 
Development Command to prepare a comprehensive "astronautics program," including 
estimates of funding and projected advances in space technology over the next 
five years. ARDC, which had been working on its own 15-year plan for Air Force 
research and development in astronautics, now boiled its findings down to a 
five-year prospectus. ARDC's report went to Headquarters USAF on December 30, 
and at the end of the year of the Sputniks the five-year plan was under 
consideration in the Pentagon.<A

<P>In any Air Force push into astronautics, NACA presumably would play a key 
role as supplier of needed research data. The agency had done this for nearly 
four decades in aeronautics. Proceeding on this premise, Putt wrote NACA [74] 
Director Dryden on January 31, 1958, formally inviting NACA's participation in a 
man-in-space program with the Air Force, including both the boost-glide research 
airplane, soon to be dubbed Dyna-Soar, and "a manned one-orbit flight in a 
vehicle capable only of a satellite orbit. . . ."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-6.htm#source60"><SUP>60</A></SUP> 
Dryden promptly approved NACA cooperation on the first approach, although the 
research agency and the Air Force would not sign their formal agreement on the 
subject until the following May.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-6.htm#source61"><SUP>61</A></SUP> 
Regarding the satellite project offer, however, Dryden informed Putt that NACA 
was working on its own designs for a manned space capsule and would "coordinate" 
with the Air Force late in March, when NACA completed its studies.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-6.htm#source62"><SUP>62</A></SUP>
<P>Behind NACA's apparent reluctance to follow the Air Force lead into manned 
satellite development was a conviction, held by some people at NACA 
Headquarters, but mainly by administrators and engineers of the Langley and 
Lewis laboratories, that the agency should broaden its activities as well as its 
outlook. Moving into astronautics, NACA should leave behind its historic 
preoccupation with research and expand into systems development and flight 
operations - into the uncertain world of large contracts, full-scale flight 
operations, and public relations. NACA should, in short, assume the leadership 
of a new, broad-based national space program, having as one of its principal 
objectives to demonstrate the practicability of manned space flight.
<P>So in the 10 months between the first Sputnik and the establishment of a 
manned space program under a new agency, NACA would follow a rather ambivalent 
course. On one hand it would continue its traditional research and consultative 
capacity, counseling the Air Force on space flight proposals and imparting its 
findings to industrial firms. But at the same time ambitious teams of engineers 
here and there in the NACA establishment would be preparing their organization 
and themselves to take a dominant role in the Nation's efforts in space.

for Participation of NACA in Development and Testing of the Air Force System 
464L Hypersonic Boost Glide Vehicle (Dyna-Soar I)," May 20, 1958, NASA Hist. 
Archives. In July 1958 the Air Force awarded concurrent feasibility study 
contracts to two contractor teams headed by the Martin Company and the Boeing 
Company. Almost two years later, after Project Mercury was well underway, Martin 
was chosen to build the booster system and Boeing the hypersonic vehicle itself. 
By that time the Dyna-Soar concept called for a true satellite vehicle acting as 
a controllable glider in the atmosphere. After a complex and controversial 
history, Dyna-Soar finally fell victim to leapfrogging space technology, 
particularly the two-man Gemini program initiated by NASA. Economy drives in the 
Defense Department also played a part in this December 10, 1963, decision. After 
an expenditure of over $350 million without a single test flight, and in the 
face of a predicted total cost of around $800 million, Secretary of Defense 
Robert S. McNamara ordered the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar project. On the 
general characteristics of Dyna-Soar see, for example, Senate Committee on
