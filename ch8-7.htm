<H1>Is Perfect Reliability Possible?</H1>[256] At NASA Headquarters in 
Washington on February 29, 1960, the high-level debate over the meticulous 
versus the statistical approach to reliability was fervently renewed. NASA, STG, 
and McDonnell representatives that day met in conference to decide what weight 
to give the "numbers game" in their own confidential estimates of readiness. 
Gilruth, Donlan, and their chief of reliability, John C. French, defended STG's 
practical procedures against the theoretical approach of Nicholas E. Golovin, 
Landis S. Gephart, and Catherine D. Hock. The third revision of McDonnell's 
reliability program was delivered by Eugene Kunznick, who also outlined the 
particulars of the prime contractor's quality control measures. Walter Williams 
presented STG's latest views on operational flight safety, and STG generally 
endorsed McDonnell's reliability program review as its own. But neither Richard 
E. Horner nor Golovin was satisfied that the pains being taken by STG and 
McDonnell were sufficient or thorough enough.<A

<P>A new Division of Life Sciences Programs was created in March at NASA 
Headquarters, with Clark T. Randt, a neurosurgeon from Cleveland, as its 
director. Part of this division's purpose was to ensure machine-rated men for 
the future of manned space flights. Earlier in the year an Air Force aeromedical 
leader, Brigadier General Don D. Flickinger, reported to NASA and STG on his 
recent trip to Russia and on the opinions he had formed about Soviet progress 
toward manned space flight. Flickinger estimated that the Soviets would attempt 
without prior announcement to orbit a two-man laboratory about mid-year. The 
American astronauts were "anxious to do anything possible to speed things up."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source74"><SUP>74</SUP></A>
<P>But the hardware was simply not yet hard enough or wearable enough for the 
insiders to get deeply excited about beating the Russians into space. Just after 
capsule No. 4 arrived at Langley, Purser went to look at it and reported to 
Gilruth: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although there are evidences of careless workmanship, I don't 
  think it is too much worse than standard aircraft practice. Also, most of the 
  bumps, patches, etc., seem to be on the unpressurized part of the structure. 
  It was also mentioned by one of the boys that Capsule 4 was never intended as 
  a flight vehicle, but only as a vibration-and-static test article; this can 
  account for a lot of the errors. While many of the bad spots could be caught 
  by inspection and corrected, a lot are non-fixable except by junking a 
  capsule. These can only be avoided by inspiring in some way, better 
  workmanship. I would suggest documenting the bad spots on Capsule 4 and then 
  having a good inspection by STG people of the flight capsules now on the line. 
  This could be repeated in 6 to 8 weeks to catch the next batch and probably 
  would cure the troubles.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source75"><SUP>75</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>After 
the late February meeting on reliability in Washington, a great deal of ferment 
was evident in systems testing, quality control, engineering inspection, and a 
new order of reliability testing. At the McDonnell factory, Robert L. Seat, who 
together with George Waldram had drawn up the first capsule systems test plan, 
began to clarify the differences between acceptable aircraft qualification test 
practices and spacecraft systems integration and reliability tests.
<P>[257] In early March, STG sent a delegation to Huntsville and Detroit for the 
latest word on reliability program upgrading at ABMA and at Chrysler. Joachim P. 
Kuettner, Eugene J. Buhmann, and von Braun's deputy, Eberhard F. M. Rees, 
conducted tours and arranged presentations for March 7 and 8. The next day at 
Chrysler's missile plant in Michigan, C. A. Brady, Bernard J. Meldrum, and L. L. 
Baker presented a similar review, which apparently satisfied their visitors from 
STG that the Redstones for Mercury could be trusted.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source76"><SUP>76</A></SUP>
<P>Through March and April the pressure on McDonnell to deliver the goods 
unfinished and yet with perfect reliability records became so acute that James 
S. McDonnell and his board of directors in St. Louis appointed their factory 
manager, Walter F. Burke, to meet and satisfy that pressure. Burke, already a 
company vice-president, was named general manager for Project Mercury. Logan 
MacMillan remained as "company-wide project manager" for McDonnell, but the 
addition of Burke signified the scale of the growth in size and scope of the 
Mercury contract.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source77"><SUP>77</A></SUP>
<P>McDonnell would have been remiss if it had not responded at the highest level 
to NASA's pressure. All the aerospace companies knew that Faget and Robert 
Piland were traveling around the country during April 1960 presenting their 
preliminary ideas and plans for "advanced vehicular" space flight programs to 
other members of the NASA family. Technical speculation was rife over how best 
to accomplish manned circumlunar flight. Other corporate giants, including 
Grumman and Convair/Astronautics, were competing for snippets of knowledge about 
what was going on in these confidential deliberations within NASA. But James 
Chamberlin, among others, was wondering, as he watched the difficulties in 
manufacturing and ground testing McDonnell's first capsules, difficulties 
particularly acute with the sequence and wiring systems, whether speculation 
about spacecraft ten years hence was legitimate, profitable, or even 
necessary.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source78"><SUP>78</A></SUP>
<P>While uneasiness over reliability was interminable, there were limits - 
practical, political, and social - to the amount of time that could be 
sacrificed for quality assurance. Decisions had to be made and, after close 
calculation, risks taken. Abe Silverstein at NASA Headquarters intervened at 
this point, deciding to short-circuit a duplicate set of prelaunch checkout 
operations. On March 29, two weeks after President Eisenhower had ordered that 
the big new NASA facility at Huntsville should be called the George C. Marshall 
Space Flight Center, Silverstein wrote von Braun a lengthy letter of 
explanation: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have just completed an extensive reexamination of all Mercury 
  schedules, from the point of view of expediting the entire Mercury program. As 
  a result of this reexamination, I have arrived at the conclusion that it is of 
  utmost importance to obtain flight performance data of certain critical 
  components of the Mercury systems at the earliest possible time. More 
  specifically, it is important to initiate the Mercury-Redstone flights as soon 
  as possible in order to obtain inflight evaluations of the Mercury capsules at 
  an early date.
  <P>
  <CENTER>* * * * * *</CENTER>
  <P>[258] A detailed study of the checkout programs at McDonnell, Huntsville, 
  and Cape Canaveral has revealed that there exists a great deal of duplication; 
  in particular all the booster capsule compatibility checks are performed both 
  at Huntsville and at the Cape. The only unique tests scheduled to be made at 
  Huntsville (on MR-1 only) is a vibration and noise test to be performed during 
  the booster static firing.
  <P>
  <CENTER>* * * * * *</CENTER>
  <P>In view of these facts, it appears that the capsule prelaunch operations at 
  Huntsville are no longer required. I have therefore directed that the Mercury 
  capsules assigned to the Redstone program be shipped from St. Louis directly 
  to Cape Canaveral, thereby gaining approximately two months in the launch 
  schedule. I suggest that all parties concerned meet at NASA headquarters in 
  Washington in the near future to discuss detailed arrangements necessitated by 
  this new procedure.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source79"><SUP>79</A></SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>But 
a week later Kuettner persuaded Silverstein to relent on this decision and to 
agree to a compromise: the capsule for MR-1 would be shipped to Huntsville for a 
much shorter period to test the mating and to check on problems of radio 
frequency and electrical compatibility. Silverstein now wrote von Braun a letter 
of appreciation for reducing the Huntsville checkout time "from 8 weeks to 16 
days, so that the Mercury-Redstone program can proceed as rapidly as possible." 
Shortly thereafter, Silverstein also learned that the Air Force Chief of Staff, 
General Thomas D. White, was reaffirming in strong language to his troops that 
the Air Force should cooperate with NASA "to the very limit of our ability, and 
even beyond it to the extent of some risk to our own programs" if that were 
necessary.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source80"><SUP>80</A></SUP>
<P>Scheduling problems continued, becoming acute toward the end of June, when 
the schedules for qualification flight tests were recognized to have slipped by 
at least six months. Complete capsule system testing seemed to require new 
organization, new procedures, and new ground test equipment. Purser filed a note 
for himself on a major meeting on June 27-28, attended by Silverstein and 
Director Harry J. Goett of Goddard, wherein the top technical managers of 
Mercury and STG began to admit that perfect reliability is indeed impossible. 
Quality control and reliability testing must be raised to a new level of effort, 
and not only man and machine but man-rating and machine-rating processes must be 
integrated, reflected Purser. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the major problems facing Mercury management is the 
  conflict between a real desire to meet schedules and the feeling of need for 
  extensive ground tests. The MAC capsule systems tests are not meeting this 
  need since they were not intended for this purpose and since the pressure of 
  time sometimes forces bypassing of some details (to be caught later at the 
  Cape). Further, there has not been time available (or taken) on the part of 
  MAC to study and update the CST procedures and SEDR's. It was concluded that a 
  group (mostly MAC effort) should be set up to review and update the CST and 
  SEDR procedures. It is also firm that no details will be bypassed in the Cape 
  checkout without the express approval of STG management.
  <P>
  <CENTER>* * * * * *</CENTER>
  <P>[259] There was considerable discussion of a proposal to eliminate the 
  unmanned orbital shots on the basis that the systems could be qualified in 
  unmanned and manned ballistic shots and that the presence of the man would 
  reduce the possibility of failure in the first orbital shots and thus reduce 
  chances for a consequent delay in the program . . . <I>it was decided</I> to 
  not change [sic] the program now but to keep the door open and reconsider when 
  MA-5 and MA-6 are closer. Since the astronauts have expressed considerable 
  interest in this proposal STG management is to discuss the above decision with 
  them.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source81"><SUP>81</A></SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Just 
before the reliability meeting in February, the Task Group had received welcome 
news of improving Atlas reliability as a result of more series-D firings since 
Big Joe. Already in mid-February STG had assigned a rough reliability 
coefficient of 75 percent, based on virtually perfect ignition and running of 
the engines and excellent performance from airborne and ground guidance systems 
in recent tests. Studies of the Abort Sensing and Implementation System for 
Mercury indicated that 13 of 43 series-D flights would have been aborted had the 
ASIS been aboard; only one of those 13 would have been terminated unnecessarily 
by the system's sensors.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source82"><SUP>82</A></SUP> 
Hopes were high, therefore, that whenever qualification flight tests should 
begin with Mercury-Atlas No. 1 (MA-1), they would follow each other rapidly at 
monthly intervals.
<P>While Edison M. Fields and Sigurd A. Sjoberg of STG began the arrangements 
for adapting Atlas 50-D to capsule No. 4 for the MA-1 flight, Hohmann's 
engineers at STL, including Jarnes W. McCurry and Ernst Letsch, together with a 
reliability team supporting Philip E. Culbertson at Convair/Astronautics, were 
all warning of the consequences from the predicted increase in capsule weight. 
Guidance and trajectory equations, dependent upon moments of inertia, center of 
gravity, and a gross capsule weight now over 3,750 pounds at launch, had to be 
recalculated.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source83"><SUP>83</A></SUP>
<P>The first Mercury-Atlas test flight was to be virtually a repeat of Big Joe, 
with the significant difference that a McDonnell capsule was to be qualified 
rather than a NASA model demonstrated. The primary objectives for MA-1 were also 
similar to those for Big Joe: to determine the integrity and stability of the 
McDonnell-built structure and to measure heating rates on the afterbody shingles 
during a critical abort and reentry.
<P>MA-2, scheduled for September, should test the integrity and flight dynamics 
of McDonnell capsule No. 6 during a simulated nominal reentry from orbit. Having 
decided to change the materials and increase the thickness of the outer shingles 
on both the conical and the cylindrical section of the capsule, STG had added 63 
more pounds by specifying the use of René 41 nickel alloy .016-inch thick on the 
conical section and 12 beryllium panels .22-inch thick on the cylindrical 
afterbody. The reinstatement of the impact bag and the drogue chute, plus the 
addition of insulation, a super sarah beacon, and heavier batteries, raised the 
estimated weight of the orbital configuration of the capsule to 3,000 pounds.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source84"><SUP>84</A></SUP>
<P>Feverish, if not frantic, work and worry went into these decisions, beginning 
[260] as soon as capsule No. 4 arrived at Langley. But Bond, Fields, and Meyer, 
taking up where they had left off with Big Joe, ran a taut project through 
mid-April; they "pessimistically and therefore," they believed, "realistically" 
estimated again that they would see this rocket's red glare on July 4, 1960. 
Caldwell C. Johnson and Jack Kinzler supervised the polishing of capsule No. 4 
as they had for the Big Joe payload.
<P>But summer arrived, and Chamberlin reported continual capsule delivery delays 
at the weekly STG capsule review board meetings. The slowdown and stretchout of 
the flight-test schedule became ever more vexing and costly. Meanwhile NASA 
Headquarters began to centralize and simplify its launch operations under 
Ostrander, leaving to Silverstein preflight worries and responsibility for 
Mercury boosters only. Warren North justified a $7 million overrun on the prime 
contract for which STG was seeking approval: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This overrun was, of course, anticipated. A major factor involved 
  in the McDonnell overrun is the high level of engineering required in support 
  of the testing program. McDonnell previously planned to reduce their 
  engineering effort in early 1960. However, because of the increased scope of 
  the testing program and the capsule changes, these engineering reductions have 
  not taken place; in fact, in their last monthly report, McDonnell shows their 
  engineering head count at 913 and increasing. The procurement overrun is due 
  primarily to subcontract overruns at Bell, AiResearch, Collins, Radioplane, 
  and Perkin-Elmer.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-7.htm#source85"><SUP>85</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>To 
try to speed things up and to keep safety paramount, Silverstein instituted 
biweekly meetings at NASA Headquarters with Walter Burke of McDonnell and 
Gilruth of STG. Both quality control and urgency militated against keeping cost 
ceilings permanent. They also militated against the schedule. Glennan had 
directed that no flight schedule changes should be made without his personal 
explicit approval. But the technological realities of ensuring highest technical 
performance and STG's priority concern for the orbital objectives of Mercury, 
rather than for suborbital man-in-space, allowed the first Mercury-Redstone 
flights to slip past, or at least alongside, the Mercury-Atlas qualification 
flights.
