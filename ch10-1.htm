<H1>Tests Versus Time in the Race for Space</H1>
<H2>(January - April 1961)</H2>[303] ON January 3, 1961, two years and three 
months after it was formed, the Space Task Group officially became a separate, 
autonomous NASA field element charged with the conduct of Project Mercury and 
any other manned space flight programs that might follow it. The Task Group, now 
composed of 667 people, was still located physically on the Hampton Roads side 
of the Langley Air Force Base and was supported by the Langley Research Center, 
but now the administrative marriage of STG with the Goddard Space Flight Center 
in Beltsville, Maryland, was annulled.<A

The Mercury team had not yet managed to launch a manned rocket, but neither 
apparently had their Russian counterparts. The United States still had a good 
chance to place the first man in space, at least for five minutes. The Soviet 
lead in orbital flight tests argued heavily against the first manned satellite 
being American, but to score first would still be some consolation.
<P>In only three years and three months since <I>Sputnik I</I>, the Soviet Union 
and the United States had launched into space a total of 42 vehicles, 38 of 
which were Earth satellites, three were solar satellites, and one was a lunar 
probe. The box score in the "space race" between the United States and the 
Soviet Union was 33 to 9 in favor of the home team, as far as publicly 
successful space launchings were concerned. But with only nine acknowledged 
launchings the U.S.S.R. had hoisted some 87,000 pounds (as opposed to the U.S. 
total of 34,240 pounds), the Soviets had hit the Moon and photographed its 
backside, and they had recovered two dogs from one Earth orbital flight. Of the 
33 American space launches, only three had been done by NASA launch vehicles and 
crews. Of the remainder, 24 had been launched by Air Force rockets, five by Army 
boosters, one by the Navy. In contrast to the responsibility for launching these 
31 Earth satellites and two solar satellites, the credit for building the 
instrumented payloads was spread more widely; the Air Force counted 15 
successes, the Army and Navy four each, and NASA 10 spacecraft. Already the 
complexity of accounting properly for mankind's successful satellite and space 
probe projects was reaching formidable proportions.<A

<P>[304] On January 11, 1961, three Soviet tracking ships were reported moving 
into the central Pacific once again. The next day, in his final State of the 
Union address, President Eisenhower commended the young space administration for 
its "startling strides" and "real progress toward the goal of manned space 
flights. " After listing all the successes of American instrumented payloads in 
space, Eisenhower said: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>These achievements make us unquestionably preeminent today in 
  space exploration for the betterment of mankind. I believe the present 
  organizational arrangements in this area, with the revisions proposed last 
  year, are completely adequate for the tasks ahead.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-1.htm#source3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>At 
this same time, President-elect John F. Kennedy announced that Jerome B. Wiesner 
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who had chaired the Democratic 
science advisory committee for the campaign, would become the new Presidential 
special assistant for science and technology. And with this announcement Kennedy 
released most of a special report made to him by Wiesner's committee of nine 
campaign advisers on the state of the Nation's security and prestige. A 
political document, the "Wiesner Report" called for a sweeping reorganization of 
the national space program. It was critical of past leadership and direction, 
and it called for more effective use of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Council, better coordination with the Department of Defense, stronger technical 
management, and a closer partnership with industry. On top of all this came the 
uncorroborated news that an Army officer had told a seminar of almost 500 
civilian and military participants that the United States had good evidence that 
at least one and probably two Soviet cosmonauts had been killed in unsuccessful 
attempts to orbit a man during Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States 
in September 1960.<A

with caution. See also memo, Aaron Rosenthal to Dir., Office of Space Flight

Official comparisons sometimes unfairly counted the weights of U.S. rocket 
casings and not those of U.S.S.R. casings.

and most informed American opinion credits the Soviet denial. Two U.S.S.R. 
attempted launchings of Mars probes on October 10 and 14, 1960, may have 
confused this issue. For an important demurrer, see the letter by Julius 
Epstein, a research associate of the Hoover Institute of Stanford University,

Secret Procedures in Space Programs," pp. 18813-18814.
