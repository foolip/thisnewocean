<H1>Whither Gemini?</H1>On June 6 and 7, 1963, Brainerd Holmes, Gilruth, Walter 
Williams, and Kleinknecht met with Administrator Webb, Hugh L. Dryden, and 
Seamans in Washington to make a final decision on whether to fly an MA-10 
mission. President Kennedy had clearly left the decision up to NASA. Webb 
listened thoughtfully to the presentations of each NASA official, and although 
both he and President Kennedy had heard the Mercury astronauts' plea for one 
more Mercury mission, Administrator Webb announced before the Senate space 
committee on June 12, 1963, that "we will not have another Mercury flight."<A

It was to be 22 months before another American manned space flight.
<P>Project Gemini, designed in 1961 to double the volume while retaining the 
basic shape and systems of the McDonnell-Mercury spacecraft, now was well into 
the development and redesign phase of construction. And the Martin Company's 
mighty Titan II rocket, in spite of a recent explosion on launch, had a record 
of nine cleancut successes out of 16 launches. Another Mercury-Atlas flight 
would have been a relatively economical way to extend space technology and fill 
the time (then estimated at a year) before Gemini-Titan could be flight-tested. 
But now that Project Apollo, employing a concept called lunar orbital rendezvous 
(LOR) to land a man on the Moon and recover him, was the ultimate goal of the 
decade, space rendezvous and docking had to be perfected. Mercury had served far 
more than its original purpose, but it could hardly be maneuverable. And so 
Project Gemini was designed to fill these gaps. As people were asking whither 
and whether Gemini was taking them, Mercury died a natural death, while Apollo 
and Saturn were aborning.
