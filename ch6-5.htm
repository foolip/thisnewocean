<H1>Applied Research</H1>By March 1, Langley Research Center was formally 
supporting the Task Group in conducting five major programs of experimentation. 
The first was an airdrop study, begun the previous summer, to determine the 
aerodynamic behavior of the capsule in free fall and under restraint by various 
kinds of parachute suspension. By early January more than a hundred drops of 
drums filled with concrete and of model capsules had produced a sizable amount 
of evidence regarding spacecraft motion in free falls, spiraling and tumbling 
downward, with and without canopied brakes, to impacts on both sea and land.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> 
But what specific kind of a parachute system to employ for the final letdown 
remained a separate and debatable question.
<P>A second group of experiments sought to prove the workability of the escape 
system designs in shots at Wallops Island. On March 11 the first "pad abort," a 
full-scale escape-rocket test, ended in a disappointing failure. After a 
promising liftoff the Recruit tractor-rocket, jerking the boilerplate spacecraft 
skyward, suddenly nosed over, made two complete loops, and plunged into the 
surf.
<P>So disappointing was this test that for several weeks the fin-stabilized pod 
rocket escape system was almost reinstituted.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> 
Three Langley engineers, [142] chagrined by this threat to their work, conducted 
a full postmortem following the recovery of the capsule. They blamed the erratic 
behavior on a graphite liner that had blown out of one of the three exhaust 
nozzles. Willard S. Blanchard, Jr., Sherwood Hoffman, and James R. Raper, 
working frantically for a month, were able to perfect and prove out their design 
of the escape rocket nozzles by mid-April. At the same time they improved the 
pitch-rate of the system by deliberately misaligning the pylon about one inch 
off the capsule's centerline.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>The third applied research program was a series of exhaustive wind-tunnel 
investigations at Langley and at the Ames Research Center to fill in data on 
previously unknown values in blunt-body stability at various speeds, altitudes, 
and angles of attack. Model Mercury capsules of all sizes, including some 
smaller than .22 rifle bullets, were tested for static-stability lift, drag, and 
pitch in tunnels. Larger models were put into free flight to determine 
dynamic-stability characteristics. Vibration and flutter tests were conducted 
also in tunnels. The variable location of the center of gravity was of critical 
interest here, as was also the shifting meta-center of buoyancy.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<P>Using the thunderous forced-draft wind tunnels at Langley and Ames, 
aeronautical research engineers pored over schlieren photographs of shock waves, 
windstreams, boundary layers, and vortexes. Most of the NASA tunnel scientists 
had long been airplane men, committed to "streamlined" thinking. Now that H. 
Julian Allen's blunt-body concept was to be used to bring a man back from 100 
miles up and travelling about five miles per second, both thought and facilities 
had to be redirected toward making Mercury safe and stable.
<P>Albin O. Pearson was one such airplane-tunnel investigator who was forced to 
change his way of thinking and his tools by the ever higher mach number research 
program for Mercury. Pearson worked at Langley coordinating all aerodynamic 
stability tests for Mercury with blunt models at trans-, super-, and hypersonic 
speeds. While exhausting the local facilities for his transonic static stability 
studies, Pearson arranged for Dennis F. Hasson, Steve Brown, Kenneth C. Weston, 
and other Langley, STG, and McDonnell aerodynamicists to use various Air Force 
tunnels at the Arnold Engineering Development Center, in Tullahoma, Tennessee. 
Beginning on April 9, 1959, a number of Mercury models and escape configurations 
were tested in the 16-foot propulsion wind tunnel and 40-inch (mach 22 
capability) "Hot Shot" facility at Tullahoma. During the next 16 months a total 
of 103 investigations utilizing 28 different test facilities were made in the 
wind-tunnel program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
<P>A fourth experiment program concerned specifically the problem of landing 
impact. Ideally touchdown should occur at a speed of no more than 30 feet per 
second, but how to ensure this and how to guard against impacts in directions 
other than vertical were exasperating problems. Landing-loads tests in 
hydrodynamics laboratories for the alternative water landing had only begun. The 
anticipated possibility of a ground impact, which would be far more serious, 
demanded shock absorbers far better than any yet devised. Although there was 
[143] still no assurance that the astronaut inside a floating capsule could 
crawl out through the throat without its capsizing, this egress problem was less 
demanding at the moment than the need for some sort of crushable material to 
absorb the brunt of a landing on land.
<P>Through April and May, McDonnell engineers fitted a series of four Yorkshire 
pigs into contour couches for impact landing tests of the crushable aluminum 
honeycomb energy-absorption system. These supine swine sustained acceleration 
peaks from 38 to 58 g before minor internal injuries were noted. The "pig drop" 
tests were quite impressive, both to McDonnell employees who left their desks 
and lathes to watch them and to STG engineers who studied the documentary 
movies. But, still more significant, seeing the pigs get up and walk away from 
their forced fall and stunning impact vastly increased the confidence of the 
newly chosen astronauts that they could do the same. The McDonnell report on 
these experiments concluded, "Since neither the acceleration rates nor shock 
pulse amplitudes applied to the specimens resulted in permanent or disabling 
damage, the honeycomb energy absorption system of these experiments is 
considered suitable for controlling the landing shock applied to the Mercury 
capsule pilot."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>Fifth, and finally, other parachute experiments for spacecraft descent were 
of major concern in the spring of 1959, because neither the drogue chute for 
stabilization nor the main landing parachute was yet qualified for its task in 
Project Mercury. Curiously, little research had been done on parachute behavior 
at extremely high altitudes. Around 70,000 feet, where the drogue chute was at 
first designed to open, and down to about 10,000 feet, where the main landing 
chute should deploy, tests had to be carried out to measure "snatch" forces, 
shock forces, and stability parameters. Some peculiar phenomena - called 
"squidding," "breathing," and "rebound" in the trade - were soon discovered 
about parachute behavior at high altitude and speed. In March, one bad failure 
of an extended-skirt cargo chute to open fully prompted a thorough review of the 
parachute development program. Specialists from the Air Force, Langley, 
McDonnell, and Radioplane, a division of the Northrop Corporation, met together 
in April and decided to abandon the extended-skirt chute in favor of a newly 
proved, yet so far highly reliable, 63-foot-diameter ringsail canopy. The size, 
deployment, and reliability of the drogue chute remained highly debatable while 
STG sought outside help to acquire other parachute test facilities.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> 
The status of most other major capsule systems was still flexible enough to 
accommodate knowledge and experience gained through ongoing tests.
<P>Two other major problems on which Langley also worked with STG, while NASA 
Headquarters planned the role and functions of the new center in Beltsville, 
concerned the formulation of final landing and recovery procedures and the 
establishment of a worldwide tracking network. Mercury planners had assumed from 
the beginning that the Navy could play a primary role in locating and retrieving 
the capsule and its occupant after touchdown. But a parallel assumption that 
existing military and International Geophysical Year tracking [145] and 
communications facilities could be utilized with relatively slight modifications 
had to be overhauled in the light of a more thorough analysis of Mercury 
requirements.
<P>The Navy's experience with search and rescue operations at sea could be 
trusted to apply directly without much modification to retrieval of the Mercury 
capsule. But a multitude of safeguards had to be incorporated in the capsule to 
ensure its safety during and immediately after impact and to reduce the time 
required for recovery to a bare minimum. William C. Muhly, STG's shop planner 
and scheduler, was most worried about these recovery aids for the Big Joe 
tests.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
<P>The most serious technical decision affecting the landing and recovery 
procedures concerned the feasibility of using an impact bag to cushion the 
sudden stop at the surface of Earth. Gilruth liked the idea of using a crushable 
honeycomb of metal foil between the shield and the pressure vessel to act as the 
primary shock absorber. But a pneumatic bag, perhaps a large inner tube or a 
torus made of fabric and extending below the capsule, either with or without the 
heatshield as its base, was still appealing. Associated with the recovery 
problem [146] were innumerable other factors related to recovery operations. The 
seaworthiness of the capsule, its stability in a rough sea, the kinds of beacons 
and signaling devices to be used, and the provisions for the possibility of a 
dry landing were foremost among these worries.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>The second major area of uncertainty revealed in January 1959 came as 
something of a surprise to Task Group people. They had assumed that the world 
was fairly well covered with commercial, military, and scientific 
telecommunications networks that could be a basis for the Mercury tracking and 
communications grid. The Minitrack network established roughly north and south 
along the 75th meridian in the Western Hemisphere for Project Vanguard turned 
out to be practically inapplicable. On the other hand, the "Moonwatch" program 
and the optical tracking teams using Baker-Nunn cameras developed by the 
Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Laboratory supplied invaluable data during 
1958. Tracking of artificial satellites showed that all previous estimates of 
atmospheric density were on the low side.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>Trajectory studies for equatorial orbits showed a remarkable lack of radio 
and cable installations along the projected track. Much depended upon the 
precise trajectory selections and orbital calculations for a Mercury-Atlas 
combination. New Atlas guidance equations that would convert the ballistic 
missile into an orbital launch vehicle had been assigned to the mathematicians 
of Space Technology Laboratories (STL) in Los Angeles. But whatever these turned 
out to be, it was becoming apparent that the world was far less well-wired 
around the middle and underside than had been thought. Furthermore the medical 
teams were insisting on continuous voice contact with the pilot. So by the end 
of February, Charles W. Mathews had convinced Abe Silverstein that STG should be 
relieved of the monumental tracking job, and NASA Headquarters drafted another 
contingent of Langley men to set up a brand-new communications girdle around the 
world.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>A large part of the Instrument Research Division at Langley, under the 
directorship of Hartley A. Soulé, provided the manpower. Soulé had previously 
laid out a timetable of 18 months for completion of a tracking network. Now he 
and the Langley Procurement Officer, Sherwood L. Butler, undertook to manage the 
design and procurement of material for its construction.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> 
Ray W. Hooker accepted the supervision of the mechanical and architectural 
engineering, and G. Barry Graves began to direct the electronics engineering. By 
mid-March the problem of providing a tracking network for Mercury was on the 
shoulders of a special task unit that came to be known as the Tracking and 
Ground Instrumentation Unit, or by the barbarous acronym "TAGIU." Although by 
this time most of the other divisions at Langley were also acting partially in 
support of Mercury, the Tracking Unit held a special position in direct support 
of the Space Task Group. Indirectly it provided NASA with its first equatorial 
tracking web for all artificial satellites. Some 35 people in the unit went to 
work immediately on their biggest problem, described by Graves as "simply to 
decide what all had to be done."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> 
By the end of April, Soulé had seen the imperative [148] need for a high order 
of political as well as technical statesmanship to accomplish his task on time. 
A detailed report to Silverstein outlined his operational plans.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>On March 17 and 18, 1959, at the McDonnell plant in St. Louis, the 
manufacturers presented to the Space Task Group for its review, inspection, and 
approval the first full-scale mockup of the complete Project Mercury manned 
satellite capsule. This "Mockup Review Inspection" represented a rough dividing 
line between the design and development phases for the project. The "Detail 
Specifications," 80 pages in length, provided a program for the customers. 
Another McDonnell document provided a written description of the "crew station" 
procedures and capabilities. And the mockup itself showed the configuration 
"exploded" into seven component parts: adapter ring, retrorocket package, 
heatshield bottom, pressure bulkhead, airframe, antenna canister, and escape 
rocket pylon.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>The chief designers, constructors, and managers of the program gathered 
around the capsule to watch demonstrations of pilot entry, pilot mobility, 
accessibility of controls, pylon removal, adapter separation, and pilot escape. 
The board of inspection, chaired by Charles H. Zimmerman, then Chief of the 
Engineering and Contract Administration Division of STG, included Gilruth, 
Mathews, Faget, Low, Walter C. Williams, who was then still Chief of NASA's High 
Speed Flight Station, and E. M. Flesh, the engineering manager of Project 
Mercury for McDonnell. In addition, eight official advisers of the board and 16 
observers from various other interested groups attended the meeting. The 
president of the corporation himself introduced his chief lieutenants: Logan T. 
MacMillan, company-wide project manager; John Yardley, chief project engineer; 
and Flesh. In consultation during the two days with some 40 McDonnell engineers, 
the Task Group recommended a total of 34 items for alteration or study. Of these 
recommendations 25 were approved immediately by the board, and the rest were 
assigned to study groups.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
<P>Among the significant changes approved at this meeting were the addition of a 
side escape hatch, window shades, steps or reinforced surfaces to be used as 
steps in climbing out of the throat of the capsule, and a camera for 
photographing the astronaut. Robert A. Champine, a Langley test pilot who had 
ridden the centrifuge with Carter C. Collins and R. Flanagan Gray the previous 
summer to help prove the feasibility of the Faget couch concept, suggested more 
than 20 minor changes in instrumentation displays and the placement of switches, 
fuses, and other controls. Also attending this mockup review were Brigadier 
General Don D. Flickinger; W. Randolph Lovelace II; Gordon Vaeth, the new 
representative of the Advanced Research Projects Agency; John P. Stapp, the Air 
Force physician who had proved that man could take deceleration impacts of up to 
40 g; and a relatively obscure Marine test pilot from the Navy Bureau of 
Aeronautics by the name of John H. Glenn, Jr.
<P>When they returned to Langley Field, Task Group officials were aware as never 
before of the magnitude of their tasks. Conversations with more than 50 
McDonnell [149] engineering group leaders had convinced them that more formal 
contract-monitoring arrangements were needed. Working committees and study 
groups had proliferated to such an extent that a capsule-coordination panel was 
needed. Gilruth appointed John H. Disher in mid-March to head the coordination 
temporarily. But by mid-June the panel was upgraded to an "office" and Disher 
was recalled to Washington by Silverstein to work with Low and Warren J. 
North.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
<P>From a nucleus of 35 people assigned to STG in October 1958, the Group had 
grown to 150 by the end of January 1959. Six months later, in July, about 350 
people were working in or with the Task Group, although some were still 
nominally attached to the research centers at Lewis or Langley.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-5.htm#source43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>The rapid growth of STG, fully endorsed by Washington, was only one of the 
problems facing its management in the spring of 1959. Perhaps the most difficult 
lesson to learn in the first year of Project Mercury was the psychological 
reorientation required to meet new economic realities. Aeronautical research 
engineers who became administrators under NACA were still essentially group 
leaders of [150] research teams. But when NACA became NASA and embarked on 
several large-scale development programs, those in development, and in STG in 
particular, became not primarily sellers of services but rather buyers of both 
services and products. To manage a development program required talents 
different from those required to manage a research program, if only because 
Government procurement policies and procedures are so complex as to necessitate 
corps of experts in supply and logistics. Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri, 
one of the knowledgeable observers watching the transition at this time, 
remarked, "The big difference between NACA and NASA is that NASA is a 
contracting agency."<A
