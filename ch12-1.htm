<H1>Chapter 12</H1>
<H1>Final Rehearsals</H1>[381] With the 1961 Labor Day holiday passed, the Space 
Task Group buckled down to an exceptionally busy season, one that was to be 
climaxed with STG's own demise and phoenix-like resurrection. Its activities had 
become far flung. Dead ahead, at Cape Canaveral, loomed the first orbital flight 
test of a Mercury capsule, carrying a true "black box," called a "crewman 
simulator," instead of an astronaut. Then, too, plans long had been ripening for 
a multi-orbital Mercury-Scout flight to qualify the ground tracking and 
communications network. A second orbital flight carrying a chimpanzee in the 
spacecraft couch also had an early place in the program.
<P>Meanwhile NASA agents had completed an extensive survey of potential sites 
for the new development and operations installation for manned space projects of 
the future. At its Langley Air Force Base domicile, STG was busy planning for 
its expanding role in manned space exploration. Its personnel were weighing 
persistent rumors that the new Manned Spacecraft Center might be located in 
Texas, somewhere near the booming city of Houston.
<P>The first objective of all this simultaneous activity was Mercury-Atlas 4, 
the fifth flight of an Atlas-launched spacecraft. This mission had been planned 
and replanned many times before the unsuccessful launch of MA-3 back in April 
1961, and the failure of that mission directly affected the MA-4 plans. During 
the early months of 1960, MA-3 had been scheduled for a suborbital flight, with 
a crewman simulator aboard. First plans called for the Atlas booster to be held 
150 feet per second below orbital velocity, with capsule separation occurring at 
the normal 100-mile-orbital-insertion altitude. Forty seconds after separation, 
retrofire was to have produced a landing beyond the Canary Islands and about 100 
miles short of the African coast. And when this test was completed successfully, 
MA-4 was to repeat MA-3, but with a chimpanzee in the cockpit. Spacecraft No. 9 
was to be specially fitted for the MA-4 flight.
<P>Toward the end of 1960, however, Walter C. Williams advised the commanding 
officer of the recovery force, Destroyer Flotilla Four, that MA-4 would try for 
three orbits with a crewman simulator aboard and that the targeted launch date 
was April 1, 1961. But the MA-3 launch, still scheduled for a [382] sub-orbital 
flight with its "mechanical astronaut," slipped to April 25. While many 
Americans worried over the Soviet space coup represented by Yuri Gagarin's 
one-orbit flight on April 12, Robert R. Gilruth and Williams already had made 
the decision to change MA-3 to a one-orbit mission.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-1.htm#source1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>April 25, 1961, came, but the day's recorded results were far from 
heartening. The MA-3 launch vehicle failed to program over into the proper 
trajectory; after 40 seconds of flight straight upward the Air Force range 
safety officer destroyed the Atlas booster. So it was necessary on MA-4 to 
strive for the same one-orbit objective and to delay still further the nominal 
three-orbit Mercury mission.
<P>Meanwhile, for various reasons, production of the spacecraft and booster for 
MA-4 fell behind schedule. Atlas No. 88-D, allotted for MA-4, did not receive 
its factory rollout acceptance inspection until June 29-30, 1961, and it was 
July 15 before it was delivered to Cape Canaveral. And spacecraft No. 9 was not 
used, though originally planned. Instead No. 8 was fished from the Atlantic 
after its ill-fated flight in MA-3 and shipped back to McDonnell in St. Louis on 
April 27 for extensive overhauling. That meant cleaning, installing new 
insulation, replacing the external portion of the hydrogen peroxide control 
system, making spot-weld repairs in the large pressure bulkhead, and replacing 
the heatshield, antenna canister, escape tower, tower clamp ring, adapter, main 
clamp ring, and the inlet and outlet air snorkels. The overhauled spacecraft, 
redesignated 8-A, was returned to the Cape, but G. Merritt Preston's crew still 
had plenty of work. A leak had to be repaired in a reaction control system fuel 
tank; the environmental control system and the automatic stabilization and 
control system had to be reworked. A fairing to reduce launch vibration, like 
the one used on the Little Joe 5-B flight on April 28, 1961, and similar to that 
used on Virgil I. Grissom's suborbital mission in July, was added to the adapter 
clamp ring.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-1.htm#source2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<P>Because of all this modification and overhaul, it was August 3 before the 
spacecraft for MA-4 was delivered to the pad and mated with the booster, 
supposedly to be launched on August 22. The day before the scheduled flight the 
Air Force's Space Systems Division in California called Cape Canaveral and 
reported that solder balls had been found in some transistors of the same brand 
that had been installed in the MA-4 booster. Coordination of this information 
among the various Mercury-Atlas teams at the Cape brought to light the fact that 
these types of transistors also had been used in the spacecraft. There was 
nothing left to do but postpone the launch and give both vehicles a thorough 
going-over to replace the defective transistors. On August 25 the spacecraft was 
returned to Hangar S, when it became apparent that this work might encompass 
several days. After these labors in the hangar, spacecraft 8-A was mated with 
the booster again on September 1. This time the engineers conducting the 
prelaunch checkouts found nothing wrong. Although 8-A was a secondhand capsule, 
its landing bag had not been installed, it had ports instead [383] of the new 
window, and the explosive egress hatch had been omitted, it still passed 
inspection.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-1.htm#source3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>Besides the problem with the defective transistors, the Mercury-Atlas booster 
had been proceeding along the same tortuous route as the capsule toward flight 
qualification. By September, the Atlas had undergone so many changes that had to 
be integrated into launch vehicle No. 88-D, and experienced so many setbacks, 
that a successful orbital mission was necessary for the sake of NASA and 
national morale and to forestall any new attacks on the Atlas as the Mercury 
launch vehicle. The year in which the Soviets had orbited a man now was in its 
ninth month, yet the United States was still preparing to orbit a box full of 
instruments. The Mercury-Atlas flight record had produced only one completely 
successful launch - the MA-2 reentry heating test - out of four tries.
<P>This was scarcely an enviable record. Many hours, days, and months had been 
spent by special committees and working groups in ferreting out the sources of 
trouble. The STG, Space Technology Laboratories, Convair, and Air Force 
engineers who had reviewed the failure of MA-1 had concluded that the forward 
end of the Atlas was not designed to withstand the flight dynamic loads fed 
through the adapter section, that the adapter was too flexible, and that 
stiffeners were needed. MA-2 had confirmed the controversial "fix" of the 
adapter section. MA-4 would be the second of the "thick-skin" Atlases. Reviewing 
the MA-3 abort, the engineers assumed that the programmer's failure to pitch the 
booster into a proper trajectory was due to a transient voltage. Also, some two 
years previously, another anomaly caused the Big Joe Atlas to fail to stage, and 
even in MA-2 there had been some propellant sloshing in the booster. To correct 
the programmer problem, Convair modified the autopilot controls to give the 
gimbaling engines of the Atlas a preventive counteraction capability. One 
objective of MA-4, therefore, was to assess this innovation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-1.htm#source4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> 
In September the NASA-Air Force- contractor engineering team that had been beset 
with Atlas problems for two years felt that the ICBM-turned-space-launcher was 
ready to do its part in Project Mercury. In the words of Scott H. Simpkinson, 
STG's liaison man at the Convair factory, "MA-4 just had to work."
<P>Not only would a successful orbital mission on MA-4 provide the necessary 
data on the performance of systems and components, but the Mercury tracking 
network crews and Department of Defense recovery forces would receive valuable 
training for supporting a manned orbital circumnavigation by an American. Many 
components, elements, procedures, and flight maneuvers had to be watched and 
assessed before one of the "Mercury seven" could be committed to an orbital 
mission around Earth.
<P>Of the manifold segments of an orbital flight, reentry was perhaps the most 
critical. As it dropped back into the heavy atmosphere, the capsule would be 
subjected to searing temperatures of about 2,000 to 3,000 degrees F for six or 
seven minutes, or about eight times longer than on the previous Mercury 
suborbital shots. Retrofire between Hawaii and Guaymas, Mexico, would bring 
about a [384] gradual descent over the North American continent. About 345 miles 
east of Savannah, the first contact with atmospheric resistance would begin, at 
an altitude of 55 miles. At this point the appearance of the .05-g light on the 
panel would telemeter a signal that reentry was coming up. Peak aerodynamic 
heating would come when the spacecraft had descended to an altitude of 37 miles 
and was traveling at 15,000 miles per hour. Braking would be dramatic. Between 
46 and 12 miles high, traveling over a slant range of 460 miles, the capsule's 
air speed would be reduced from about 17,000 to 1,350 miles per hour. 
Aerodynamic stresses in this region would provide a severe test of the 
spacecraft's structural strength, particularly the heatshield and the afterbody 
shingles.
<P>Perhaps the second most critical segment of the orbital mission would come 
during the powered phase of the flight. The Space Task Group, supported by the 
DOD and industry, would also monitor carefully the vibration levels to ascertain 
if they would be tolerable for an astronaut. Even more important as the capsule 
was rocketed toward orbit was a reliable escape system, to wrench the capsule 
clear if the launch vehicle failed to perform. Also it was necessary to judge 
the ability of the Atlas to release the spacecraft, to evaluate the abort 
sensing and implementation system, to determine if the launch vehicle could 
withstand the aerodynamic loads of max q, and to demonstrate the capability of 
the Mercury network to perform its intended flight-control and data-collection 
functions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-1.htm#source5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> 
If all went well, MA-4 would provide data proving the validity of years of 
engineering calculations.
<P>MA-4 would be launched from complex 14 at the Cape on a true azimuth heading 
of 72.51 degrees east of north. Following engine ignition, after being held to 
the pad for three seconds to ensure smooth combustion, the Atlas booster engines 
would propel the spacecraft within two minutes to a speed of about 6,500 miles 
per hour and an altitude of 35 miles over a downrange distance of 45 miles. The 
sustainer engine would continue to burn. A gradual pitch program would begin to 
tilt the Atlas toward the sea about 20 seconds after liftoff. Seconds after 
booster engine cutoff (called "BECO" by the various Mercury-Atlas working teams 
at the Cape), or at about 41 miles' altitude and a slant range of 56 miles from 
the pad, the launch vehicle programmer would trigger a greater pitch-over 
maneuver to put the Mercury-Atlas combination on a course parallel to Earth's 
surface. At this time the escape tower would be jettisoned. After capsule 
separation, orbital insertion would occur about 498 miles downrange from the pad 
at an altitude of about 100 miles. The nominal inertial velocity at this point 
was supposed to be 25,695 feet per second, increased to 25,719 feet per second 
by the ignition of the posigrade rockets, which separated the spacecraft from 
the booster. Within 50 seconds, the spacecraft should have drifted some 790 feet 
from the booster. The Atlas, rather than falling away, would trail the orbiting 
spacecraft around Earth at an altitude of about 100 miles, and should complete 
each circle about once every 90 minutes for an estimated three days.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-1.htm#source6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
<P>Instrumentation affixed to the spacecraft would provide data from nearly 
[385] every conceivable point about the capsule. Noise levels in the vicinity 
where an astronaut's head would rest would be measured and recorded on magnetic 
tape. Excess vibration, a problem during early Mercury-Redstone flights, would 
be monitored closely by seven strategically placed sensors, mostly in the area 
where capsule and adapter joined. To determine what radiation dosages a pilot 
would encounter, four standard and two special film packs would be carried. The 
standard packs were placed on the sides and at the top and bottom of the couch. 
Carrying a heavier emulsion, the two extra packs would measure the radiation 
spectrum - the range of all kinds of radiation to which the capsule would be 
exposed - as well as penetration levels. Flight data other than radiation would 
be transmitted by two separate telemetry links, each providing essentially the 
same information.
<P>The flight would be well covered photographically. Located on the left side 
of the capsule cabin was the instrument panel camera, which would start 
operating at liftoff, provide about 20,000 frames of panel information during 
the mission, and cease five seconds after impact. Placed near the right-side 
port, the Earth-sky camera was loaded for about 600 frames of pictorial data, 
which would be exhausted somewhere over the Indian Ocean. A third camera, 
affixed to the periscope, was loaded with about 10,000 frames of film for the 
mission. This camera would provide especially useful information on the 
spacecraft's orbital attitude reference to Earth at points where landmarks were 
recognizable.
<P>Five recorders aboard the spacecraft would tape most of the mission data. 
Three were seven-track systems to record all telemetry outputs, vibration 
levels, noise, and shingle strain. The two others were single-track recorders, 
to be operated in tandem and used to check the reliability of the tracking 
network communications system.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-1.htm#source7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
<P>Plans for spacecraft operations after the powered phase were essentially the 
same as those for the suborbital flights, only on a much larger scale. Retrofire 
was scheduled at 1 hour, 29 minutes, and 4 seconds after launch, with the three 
rockets firing at five-second intervals in order: top-left, bottom, top-right.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-1.htm#source8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
Recovery plans for orbital missions were considerably more complicated than they 
had been for the suborbital flights, since many more contingency areas, 
including abort and overshoot, had to be considered. Besides the nominal landing 
area off the coast of Bermuda, five secondary landing areas were selected. 
Providing that the launch was nominal and proceeded according to the preflight 
calculated trajectory, the abort recovery areas were spaced as follows: Area A 
began about 13 miles from the launch pad and continued along the track for 2,200 
miles. For the first 550 miles the coverage extended 30 miles to each side of 
the track. This area covered the first 72 seconds after launch, or through 
booster staging. The remainder of Area A, accounting for the period up to 298 
seconds after launch, narrowed to about 15 miles on either side of the track. 
Areas B and C were small elliptical blips on the track, 4 and 8 degrees of 
longitude beyond A. These were designated for a possible abort at 298 or at 301 
seconds, respectively. [386] The third contingency site, Area D, was a longer 
ellipse (20 by 122 miles) beginning about 7 degrees of longitude past C. At this 
point the "go/no go" flight decision would be made. The last, Area E, an ellipse 
24 by 231 miles along the track, covered aborts up to 304 seconds after the 
go/no go decision.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-1.htm#source9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>The MA-4 capsule also was fitted with a number of aids to assist the DOD 
forces in their recovery task. Two one-pound sofar bombs, one set to eject upon 
main parachute deployment and the other set to detonate at 4000 feet of 
hydrostatic pressure if the spacecraft sank, were carried. A flashing light with 
a life of about 24 hours was set to activate upon impact. Fluorescein dye, 
ejected at touchdown, would be visible for about six hours. Navy recovery forces 
were asked to attempt the recovery of the drogue and main chutes and the 
spacecraft antenna canister. Balsa wood blocks and Styrofoam had been attached 
to these components for flotation.<A

<P>As the launch date of the Mercury-Atlas 4 combination neared, weather 
problems began to threaten this attempt to orbit a "mechanical astronaut." Not 
one but two hurricanes thrashed the Mercury tracking areas. "Carla" raked the 
Corpus Christi tracking station, while "Debbie" moved in a northerly direction 
on the day before the launch, menacing and causing the ships to get rather a 
"rough ride" in the prime recovery zone. The equipment at the Texas site 
withstood the storm without damage. The STG-Air Force-Navy recovery planners at 
the Cape felt that Weather Bureau support predictions had given them a 
sufficient margin of safety in the Atlantic to allow the mission to proceed.<A

launch the radio-inertial guidance system would be measuring speed, altitude, 
and flight course. If those factors anticipated a successful orbital insertion, 
the ground guidance computer, in operation shortly after booster engine cutoff,
