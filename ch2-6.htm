<H1>Matter From Space</H1>Even after enclosing himself in a sealed cabin and 
adjusting to prolonged isolation, the first man in space ran the danger of being 
killed by decompression if his cabin were punctured by one of the myriad 
meteoroids, ranging in size from less than a millimeter up to several meters, 
that constantly bombard Earth's atmosphere.<A

Impact with a meteoroid, even one the size of a BB shot, conceivably could put a 
hole in the structure of a spacecraft and cause death to its occupant through 
either gradual or explosive cabin decompression.
<P>In the forties and early fifties scientists varied widely in their guesses as 
to the probability of meteoroid impact. Fletcher G. Watson, a Harvard University 
astronomer, predicted in 1946 that at least one of every 25 space ships going to 
the Moon would be destroyed by collision with a meteoroid. Two years later 
George Grimminger, a mathematician with the Rand Corporation, estimated that a 
spacecraft with an exposed area of 1,000 square feet would be hit by a particle 
with a diameter of ½ millimeter only about once every 15 years. As late as 1951, 
however, Fred L. Whipple of Harvard, one of the principal American authorities 
on meteoroids, was rather pessimistic about the chances of avoiding meteoroid 
penetration and suggested thick shielding on the spacecraft to guard against 
structural damage.<A

<P>The early instrumented satellites sent up by the Soviet Union and the United 
States did much to dispel the fears of the space flight enthusiasts about 
meteoroids. [49] The American satellite <I>Explorer I,</I> launched in January 
1958, recorded only seven hits by micrometeoroids - particles considerably less 
than a millimeter in diameter - during the first month of its orbital life. 
Apparently none of these pieces of matter penetrated the satellite's outer skin. 
Data from the much larger Russian <I>Sputnik III, </I>sent into orbit in May 
1958, indicated that an orbiting spacecraft with a surface of 1,000 square 
meters (10,760 square feet) would be hit by a meteoroid weighing at least one 
gram only once every 14,000 hours. And Explorer VI, orbited by the United States 
in the late summer of 1959, encountered meteoroid dust particles only 28 times 
during the first two days it was in orbit.<A

These data prompted a human-factors specialist for one of the major aerospace 
firms to conclude that for low orbital missions in a manned spacecraft "the 
danger from meteorite [sic] penetration is minor to negligible in comparison to 
the other hazards of such flights."<A

Nevertheless, Project Mercury astronauts would wear a full-pressure suit, a 
closed ecological system in itself, so that if cabin decompression occurred each 
astronaut could live until his space capsule could be brought back to Earth.

space flight experts there is considerable variation in the uses and definitions 
of the terms "meteoroid," "meteorite," and "meteor." Throughout this study the 
authors have employed what is apparently standard NASA terminology: a meteoroid 
is a solid object larger that a molecule and smaller than an asteroid, moving in 
interplanetary space; a meteorite is such an object that reaches Earth's surface 
without completely vaporizing in the atmosphere; and a meteor is the light 
phenomenon resulting from a meteoroid's entrance into the atmosphere.
