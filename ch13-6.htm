<H1>Program Growth</H1>The dramatic series of events surrounding the MA-6 
mission tended to obscure what was happening elsewhere in the national space 
program. While Project Mercury finally was fulfilling its prime objective, NASA 
picked the launch vehicle for its Apollo program. Headquarters announced on 
January 9, 1962, that a "Super Saturn" (also known as "Advanced Saturn" and 
"Saturn C-5") would be the Moon program rocket. The Saturn was then described as 
being as tall as a 27-story building generating 7.5 million pounds of thrust in 
its first stage, which would make it about 20 times more powerful than the 
Atlas. On January 25, the Marshall Space Flight Center received orders from NASA 
Headquarters to develop this booster that could support manned circumlunar 
flights and manned lunar landings. The Saturn was to place 120 tons in low-Earth 
orbit or send 45 tons of spacecraft toward the Moon. At the same time, the 
public got its first view of drawings of the Apollo and Gemini spacecraft.<A

<P>When the House Committee on Science and Astronautics opened its annual budget 
hearings on February 27, 1962, among the first witnesses to testify were John 
Glenn, Alan Shepard, and Virgil Grissom. Representative George P. Miller of 
California, chairman of the committee, introduced the three as "men who have 
been closest to the angels and still remain on Earth." All committee members 
expressed their satisfaction with the management of Project Mercury, and they 
reminded NASA that the agency was the committee's protege. Every tax dollar 
required to make Project Mercury and the rest of the civilian space program a 
success so far had resulted from the committee's study, approval, and 
authorization.<A

<P>[438] After the astronauts had made brief statements and answered some 
questions posed by the committee members, Administrator James E. Webb outlined 
the NASA budget request for fiscal year 1963. The total NASA request was for 
$3,787,276,000, of which $2.26 billion was earmarked for developing Gemini and 
Apollo and for further exploration with Mercury in manned space flight. Robert 
Gilruth testified about the Mercury portion of NASA's undertaking. By August 
1962, when Congress passed the authorization bill, the NASA appropriation had 
been pruned to $3,644,115,000. This reduction included $90 million from 
research, development, and operational requests, and about $52.8 million asked 
for construction of new facilities. But the total NASA money bill, coupled with 
almost $1 billion that the Department of Defense received for its space 
projects, meant that the Nation was going to spend almost $5 billion annually on 
its space efforts.<A

The second phase of the Space Age seemed about to commence.
<P>[440] Meanwhile the Manned Spacecraft Center had been undergoing rapid 
changes, even though it was still located at the Langley Research Center pending 
the move to Houston. On January 15, 1962, the Mercury Project Office was 
established, reporting directly to Gilruth, together with the Gemini and Apollo 
management offices. Kenneth S. Kleinknecht, a former leader in NASA's X-15 
project and technical assistant on Gilruth's staff since January 11, 1960, was 
picked to manage the completion of Mercury's program. Under its charter, the 
Mercury Project Office was "responsible for the technical direction of the 
McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and other industrial contractors assigned work on 
the Mercury Project."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-6.htm#source58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
<P>Project Office staffing and division of duties had been completed by the end 
of January. Kleinknecht chose William Bland, who had been associated with 
numerous engineering phases of the manned satellite enterprise since its 
inception, as his deputy. The internal labor divisions of the Office were: 
Project Engineering Office, Project Engineering Field Office (Cape), Engineering 
Operations Office, and Engineering and Data Measurements Office. At the outset, 
42 people worked in the Project Office primarily on scheduling, procurement, and 
technical monitoring tasks. The similar management organizations set up for the 
Gemini and Apollo programs had James A. Chamberlin (manager of Mercury until the 
inception of Project Gemini) and Charles W. Frick as their managers, 
respectively.<A

<P>Moving MSC from tidewater Virginia to the Gulf Coast of Texas could have had 
adverse effects on its staffing. Quite a number of the employees had long years 
of service with NACA and its successor NASA, and had established deep personal 
roots at Langley and around Hampton, Virginia. Now they would be uprooted and 
transplanted some 1500 miles away in Texas. Many would face inconvenience and 
monetary and personal losses resulting from the transfer. Stuart H. Clarke, 
chief of the Personnel Office of MSC, polled the staff to determine how many 
favored the move. Of 1152 employees, only 84 indicated that they would not go.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-6.htm#source60"><SUP>60</SUP></A> 
Gilruth and Williams decided that while people, records, and equipment were 
being transferred, the operational and Mercury Project Office activities should 
remain at Langley to prevent the disruption of Project Mercury's flight 
planning. This meant that management in Mercury would be directed from Langley 
at least through Mercury-Atlas 7.<A

of the personnel survey about 400 to 500 could have been termed "old guard." The 
remainder, being essentially "new hires," did not really care whether they 
settled in Hampton or Houston. The 84 who chose not to go were mainly of the 
"old guard."

a month.
