<H1>Moving to the Launch Site</H1>The imminent shift from development into the 
operational phase of Mercury was reflected in several different ways. Military 
and industrial relations at Cape Canaveral were undergoing rapid change as 
management and launch facilities were partially modified to accommodate the 
influx of a new team for manned space flight. Melvin N. Gough, the senior test 
pilot who had established NASA's basis for operations at the Cape, departed for 
a job with the Civil Aeronautics Board, and into his shoes stepped G. Merritt 
Preston for STG and Kurt H. Debus for Marshall's launch operations, now also a 
part of NASA. The Air Force also added more help for NASA support activities 
under Colonel Asa B. Gibbs and J. W. Rosenberry. Overcrowded facilities and 
overlapping checkout and launch schedules were causes for interminable official 
dickering but not for any program delay. Project Mercury eventually acquired 
Hangar S and launch complexes 56 for Mercury-Redstone and 14 for Mercury- 
Atlas.<A

<P>Although the rank and file of the Space Task Group were barely aware of the 
new liaison between NASA Headquarters and McDonnell reliability experts, the 
quest for quality control at the working level was entering a new phase. In the 
early summer of 1960, about 50 men from STG established residence in Florida. 
John F. Yardley, along with about 80 McDonnell technicians, set up shop in 
mobile-home trailers around Hangar S, in the industrial area within the fences 
[269] of Cape Canaveral. By the end of the year the number of technicians 
working on the capsules for preflight checkout at the Cape had grown to more 
than 400, most of the increase made up by contract personnel.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-2.htm#source16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
<P>At the McDonnell factory in St. Louis, peak employment on Mercury systems had 
reached 880 in April 1960. After that, there was a gradual decline in Mercury 
production workers as Yardley's field team increased to 120 by summer's end. 
Because STG had called for the first four capsules from McDonnell's production 
line before they were entirely finished, the maximum of 427 workers on the 
factory floor in May 1960 declined with the buildup of preflight polishing 
activities at the Cape. Yardley and his crews soon became the center of 
attention for unofficial helpers and kibitzers from other organizations and 
contractors, many of whom were glad to provide materials and tools that were 
urgently needed and in short supply among McDonnell people at the Cape.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-2.htm#source17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>Yardley, his assistants at the Cape - E. F. Peters and Robert L. Foster - and 
other working engineers knew little about the separate reliability contract 
between NASA Headquarters and McDonnell. Walter F. Burke, Logan T. MacMillan, 
and the quality manager, N. E. Covinsky, did know that this extra business was 
coming to their company through separate channels, but they and their production 
engineers were so busy trying to make each capsule work properly that they too 
could see little sense in the "numbers game." Each system and subsystem seemed 
to have its own personality. But to guard against overemphasizing these 
individual idiosyncrasies, capsule No. 10 was set aside as the standard test 
article at McDonnell. As preflight checkouts at the Cape uncovered more and more 
unique difficulties, the need for still more stringent quality control was made 
plain.
<P>No one recognized this more than Yardley, who in the summer of 1960 urged his 
company to institute a new order of reliability tests. He did not insist on 
statistical performance data, but he did enjoin improvement of 
environmental-chamber reliability testing of components. Robert L. Seat, 
McDonnell's senior test engineer, was pressed by Silverstein in Washington, by 
Lewis R. Fisher of STG, and by Yardley from the Cape, as well as by the 
burgeoning number of test requests between McDonnell departments, to prepare 
specifications for an exhaustive environmental reliability testing program. On 
September 26, 1960, the project to flight-test a man in orbit was supplemented 
by an authorization to ground-test the capsule in a simulated mission through 
physical environments in a "space chamber." This simulated orbital test program 
gradually became known as "Project Orbit."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-2.htm#source18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>The reaction control system on capsule No. 2 was giving Yardley headaches. In 
general the power and sequential systems on all capsules were full of 
"glitches," or minute transient voltages from inexplicable origins. Surely more 
problems could be expected from space operations. So the simulated mission test 
program, designed specifically to detect unknown anomalies arising from four and 
a half hours of continuous operation in a vacuum alternately hot and cold, like 
"day" and "night" for the manned satellite, was welcomed by all hands. [270] 
Unfortunately it would take six months to build, install, test, and modify the 
new space chamber test facility at the McDonnell plant. Several smaller, less 
sophisticated "man-rating" vacuum chambers had already been used but none was 
capable of simulating the extremes of orbital conditions.
<P>Prelaunch preparations at the launch site began in June 1960 with an 
understanding between STG and McDonnell that some rework would be performed 
there in addition to extravagant preflight checkout tests, but the extent of the 
last-minute work to be performed and the number of discrepancies to be corrected 
became so great that "preflight checkout" quickly came to be a misnomer. Under 
Preston at the Cape, John J. Williams eventually came to head the "Preflight 
Operations" division, instead of being simply "checkout" crew chief. Paul C. 
Donnelly, Archibald E. Morse, Jr., A. Martin Eiband, Walter J. Kapryan, and 
Jacob C. Moser gradually became involved with wholesale systems engineering as 
the thoroughgoing checkouts in Hangar S expanded.
<P>Gilruth laid down the law "for what is perhaps the most important single 
requirement in our programs: that designs, procedures, and schedules must have 
the flexibility to absorb a steady stream of change generated by a continually 
increasing understanding of space problems." This policy of correcting every 
discovered deficiency and of modifying each spacecraft down to the finish line 
at launch time was what Gilruth meant by an "R and D" program; it sacrificed 
cost and schedules if necessary in the interest of quality or reliability as the 
experimentalists understood it.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-2.htm#source19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>Through August 1960 "space chamber" ground testing for Mercury had consisted 
primarily of the capsule systems tests for integration and compatibility in a 
relatively mild vacuum and of the manned environmental control system tests 
simulating an altitude of 40,000 feet. McDonnell had detected many design 
deficiencies in these test programs. Now early development failures, arising 
from unanticipated interactions between parts and components and from errors in 
estimating the effects of environmental extremes, became most troublesome.
<P>At St. Louis in mid-August, the "Development Engineering Inspection," a 
milestone meeting comparable to the Mockup Review, brought together for three 
days all the chief actors and participants in the hardware work on the capsule. 
Walter C. Williams and Kenneth S. Kleinknecht were eager to institute this old 
Air Force custom - the "D.E.I.," as they called it - as a basic check on systems 
integration and configuration control. When on August 18 the 30 members of the 
NASA inspection team departed, they were well assured that the Mercury capsule 
on display (No. 7) was safe for manned flight, but only for a suborbital 
mission. Orbital flight would require a higher order of precautions for 
reliability. "Project Orbit," taking advantage of recent advances in vacuum 
technology, promised to pioneer this new dimension in development engineering by 
bringing the space climate down to Earth. Capsule No. 10 was specifically set 
aside in September for environmental chamber testing at McDonnell for orbital 
conditions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-2.htm#source20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>[271] While the Tenney Engineering Company of Union, New Jersey, was building 
the new vacuum chamber for man-rated environmental testing of the capsule at the 
Cape, and while McDonnell engineers were moving in to augment STG's preflight 
checkout group there, one NASA operations expert transferred back to tidewater 
Virginia to help Gilruth and French formulate policy and establish STG's 
competence to judge reliability and flight safety issues. F. John Bailey, Jr., 
was Gilruth's choice for the man most likely to reconcile the differences 
between reliability based on experience and on expertise. Bailey believed an 
engineer needed 15 or 20 years' experience in any specialty to be a proper judge 
of the state of his art; he also appreciated the value of mathematical models in 
the redesign stages of technological evolution. But he quickly became convinced, 
particularly by studying the carefully balanced engineering compromises between 
efforts to make the boosters perfect and to perfect the escape system, that 
Mercury dependability could hardly be improved except by flight testing.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-2.htm#source21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>Everyone recognized dangers in the pragmatic experimental approach to 
pilotless spacecraft research, but each calculated the risks differently. 
Silverstein and the new Associate Administrator, Robert C. Seamans, Jr., who 
succeeded Horner at this post on September 1, 1960, were among those at 
Headquarters who justly feared that overemphasis on the uniqueness of each 
production capsule and on STG's policy of continuous rework might lead to so 
many "quick fixes" that a pyramid of unobtrusive changes could cover up the 
truth about whatever might go wrong.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-2.htm#source22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>Perhaps the most pertinent of these difficulties with systems integration 
derived from NASA bench tests of the reaction control system. The manufacturer 
of the RCS, Bell Aerosystems Company, ran its qualification test program from 
August through October 1960 and reported all phases of the testing 
satisfactorily completed. Subsequent tests by McDonnell, STG, other NASA 
engineers, the preflight teams at the Cape, and eventually by the workers on 
Project Orbit revealed innumerable electrochemical and electromechanical 
problems in simulated environments that required small changes here and there 
and eventually everywhere. The thrust chambers, metering orifices, solenoid 
valves, expulsion bladder, and relief valves each presented developmental flaws 
that were "solved" more often by improvisations than by scientific redesign. 
Karl F. Greil, a thermodynamicist who was working for Grand Central Rocket 
Company in 1960 to perfect the escape pyrotechnology for Mercury, joined STG and 
its reaction controls test team in 1961 and tried in vain to apply the same 
perfectionistic standards to this vastly more complicated and inherently less 
reliable system of moving parts: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is the irony: the results that counted in Mercury's RCS were 
  due to changes of the screen, heat barrier, and orifices, all of which were 
  made upon simple first thought. On the other hand, the large amount of 
  experimentation on the valve resulted merely in the assurance that nothing 
  needed to be changed so far as valve design was concerned. This irony, that 
  the simple approach [272] did the entire job while the sophisticated approach 
  merely resulted in an "Amen", is indeed worthy of reflection, because it has 
  in store both a risk and a lesson: a lesson because there is so much glamor 
  cast on sophisticated pretense and so much disregard for the profane causes of 
  all kinds of trouble; a risk because the simple remedy which did the job once 
  without ever having become clear just how it really worked, such success 
  without perspiration is likely to remain confined to its own historical case. 
  But having established a precedent, it is bound to seduce us into relying on 
  it, if it is not even bound to become a myth and a dogma.<A

Fortunately 
neither the reaction system nor the environmental control system for the Mercury 
suborbital flight had to be so nearly perfected as the escape, structural, and 
landing systems. The development engineering inspection confirmed the faith of 
most project engineers, in spite of a spate of impatient criticism from 
outsiders, that capsule sequencing, electrical, communications, stabilization, 
environment, pyrotechnical, instrumentation, and landing and recovery systems 
were virtually ready to fly. McDonnell issued a revised set of detail 
specifications for capsule No. 7 soon afterward. The Aerospace Corporation, 
spawned from and now replacing Space Technology Laboratories (STL) for Air Force 
systems engineering activities, published in September its basic planning 
document, the "General Flight Plan: Atlas Boosters for Project Mercury."<A

<P>If Project Mercury were on the verge of technological bankruptcy, as some 
critics claimed, the problem was that man was still land-locked by inadequate 
boosters. The Redstone for Mercury was still not man-rated. The first 
Mercury-Atlas flight on July 29, 1960, not only did not qualify anything, it 
seemed actually to have disqualified an indispensable part of Mercury. It cast 
everything into doubt.
