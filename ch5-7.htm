<H1>Heat Sink Versus Ablation</H1>Since the peak heating rates for this 
blunt-body, high-drag configuration were expected to be one whole order of 
magnitude less than those experienced by ballistic missiles, no one competent to 
judge the issue now considered the "thermal barrier" problem insoluble. Rather, 
it had been proven to be no more than a "thermal thicket." Since the 
mid-fifties, various civilian and military experimental teams had studied the 
reentry problems for ballistic missile warheads, but only part of this research 
data was applicable to the different case of the spacecraft. Army and Vitro 
Corporation reentry experiments using ablation materials (such as graphite, 
teflon, nylon, or lucite) had already demonstrated that Jupiter nose cones 
worked quite well as ablators. But NACA preferred to rely on the successful 
prior experience of the Air Force with heat-sink metals, particularly copper, 
for early Thor nose cones. The results of these thermodynamic studies in 
materials science were contradictory, or at least inconclusive. So the manned 
satellite project began life officially in October without a commitment to 
either method of heat shielding, but with a definite preference for Faget's 
prejudice.<A

<P>Gilruth, Faget, and other members of the Space Task Group since March 1958 
had been leaning toward the heat sink. A 600-pound metallic heat sponge might be 
a little heavier but it would be more reliable than a ceramic heat dissipator, 
for the simple reason that there was more industrial experience with fabricating 
refractory metals than with molding and bonding ablation materials. Some 
officials were convinced by the Navy's successful use of a lightweight beryllium 
heat sink on Polaris flight tests that beryllium was the answer. The heat sink 
method also was thought to have the considerable advantage over ablating 
materials of creating less of a "plasma sheath" - the envelope of ionized air 
[128] generated by the friction of atmospheric braking. Telemetry and 
communications blackouts from this phenomenon might be troublesome. Pending 
further study, the Task Group and Silverstein decided to retain the original 
specification that a beryllium heatshield be provided by the capsule contractor. 
Requiring all the bidders to assume a beryllium shield should give a fairer 
evaluation of their proposals. Until Big Joe could test the ablation technique, 
no final decision would be made.<A

<P>Ablation technology, imprecise by nature, was neither well understood nor 
very highly sophisticated as yet, whereas the metallography of heat sink 
materials was straightforward, and the thermodynamics of metals was deducible. 
Faget believed there would be no intrinsic weight penalty for using a metal 
shield; the difficulty of ditching a hot shield without danger had yet to be 
solved. There was no disposition to ignore ablation in favor of heat sink. Big 
Joe was conceived to resolve the problem. By late November, when Aleck Bond took 
charge of it, his presumption was that Big Joe would provide the definitive test 
of an ablation heatshield.
<P>Rocketry was not the only means considered for accomplishing high-altitude 
qualification tests at the beginning of the program. On their own initiative in 
the summer of 1958, Jerome Hammack, John B. Lee, Joe W. Dodson, and other 
Langley engineers had begun a modest program of parachute and stability trials 
by dropping boilerplate capsule models from C-130 transports provided by the Air 
Force. Balloon flights, however, seemed to promise even more effective and 
economical means of qualifying by "space-soaking" the complete capsule and its 
associated systems. From the Montgolfier brothers in the 1780s to David G. 
Simons' Manhigh ascents in 1957 and the contemporary Strato-Lab project of the 
Navy, ballooning had always been an attractive way to pierce the vertical 
dimension.<A

<P>Believing that the environmental conditions at extreme altitude could be 
experienced more easily than they could be simulated in vacuum chambers on 
Earth, the Space Task Group proceeded with plans to launch balloons carrying 
ballistic capsules as gondolas. Tests of instrumentation, retrorockets, drogue 
and main parachute systems, and recovery procedures, plus pilot orientation and 
training, might be done within a year's time by lighter-than-air ascents. 
Contracts were let to the Weather Bureau, the Office of Naval Research, and the 
Air Force Cambridge Research Center for planning this flight support program.<A

<P>No sooner had these feasibility studies been started than the Space Task 
Group discovered how intricate, vast, and expensive had become stratospheric 
sounding technology in recent years. The popular craze over Unidentified Flying 
Objects during the fifties had been caused partly by atmospheric and cosmic-ray 
research with floating objects, enormous Mylar plastic gas bags drifting around 
at high altitudes. Preliminary balloon flights for the manned satellite project 
threatened to become much more expensive than had been originally anticipated.<A

<P>Contract planning, booster procurement, and the need for specialized help 
[129] from the military services were central concerns of NASA and the Space 
Task Group during their first three months of existence. The possibility of 
friction in management relations between NASA and the Defense Department was 
also recognized as a potential problem. To facilitate coordinated work and 
plans, STG needed in-house representatives in uniform. Efficient administration 
demanded liaison officers to serve as single points of contact between STG and 
each of the military services. So in December orders were cut for Lieutenant 
Colonel Keith G. Lindell of the Air Force, Lieutenant Colonel Martin L. Raines 
of the Army, and Commander Paul L. Havenstein of the Navy to report to the Space 
Task Group for this function.
<P>In general, relations between NASA and the Department of Defense had 
proceeded quite amicably since the drafting of a "Memorandum of Understanding" 
in September by the Joint Manned Satellite Panel.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-7.htm#source49"><SUP>49</A></SUP> 
However, with so much initiative being taken by the Space Task Group, there was 
danger that the concurrent actions of NASA Headquarters and STG might cause some 
frustrations and confusions in the Pentagon and among military contractors. NASA 
was still too young for its STG to be known. At this stage most of the planning 
for budgeting, procurement, tracking, and recovery operations had to be done in 
Washington; NASA Headquarters was carefully guarding its prerogative of 
conducting interagency business.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-7.htm#source50"><SUP>50</A></SUP> 
Cooperation between Defense and NASA, and between STG and its own Headquarters, 
was good, if not idyllic, during the first 100 days. Nowhere was this more 
obvious than in astronaut selection.
