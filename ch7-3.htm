<H1>Converging Technologies</H1>The problem of man-rating the Redstone rocket 
was tackled with characteristic gusto by Joachim P. Kuettner, the man Wernher 
von Braun had called in 1958 to lead the Army's effort if Project Adam had been 
authorized. Kuettner had earned doctorates in law, physics, and meteorology 
before he became a flight engineer and test pilot for Messerschmitt during the 
Third Reich. Having been one of the first to test a manned version of the V-1 in 
1944, Kuettner had made further use of his avocation as a jet aircraft and 
sailplane pilot for the U.S. Air Force Cambridge Research Center before joining 
the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) at Huntsville.
<P>In retrospect Kuettner has generalized about the problem of "Man-Rating Space 
Carrier Vehicles" in terms relating his experience with both aviation and 
missile technologies: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it is admittedly an oversimplification, the difference 
  between the two technologies may be stated in the following general terms. 
  From an aviation standpoint, man is not only the subject of transportation, 
  and as such in need of protection as a passenger; but he is also a most 
  important integral part of the machine over which he truly has control. His 
  decisions in expected and unexpected situations are probably the greatest 
  contributions to his own safety. Aviation, to the best of our knowledge, has 
  never seen the necessity for a fully automatic initiation of emergency escape.
  <P>In contrast, rocket technology has been for 20 years a missile technology 
  governed by the requirements of target accuracy and maximum range. As such, it 
  had to develop automatic controls. Unlike a human payload, a warhead has no 
  use except on the target. Once the missile fails, it may as well destroy 
  itself during flight. (For this reason, missilery has accepted aerodynamically 
  unstable vehicles which, in case of loss of thrust, flip over and break apart, 
  [172] destroying themselves in the air.) There has been no need to save the 
  payload after a successful flight or in case of a catastrophe.
  <P>The development of manned space flight is not just a matter of replacing a 
  warhead by a manned cabin. Suddenly, a switch is thrown between two parallel 
  tracks, those of missile technology and those of aviation technology, and an 
  attempt is made to move the precious human payload from one track to the 
  other. As in all last-minute switchings, one has to be careful to assure that 
  no derailment takes place.<A

the spring of 1959, while Kuettner was still signing himself the "Adam-NASA 
Project Engineer," he and his deputy, Earl M. Butler, began a series of 
triangular conferences, with Kurt H. Debus and Emil P. Bertram of ABMA's Missile 
Firing Laboratory at the Cape, in one corner, and Charles Mathews and Jerome B. 
Hammack, the Mercury-Redstone project engineer for STG, in the Langley corner. 
Between these informal discussions and six formal study panels inaugurated by 
von Braun, a consensus was supposed to arise on, among other things, the sort of 
emergency detection system necessary to warn of impending cataclysms in the 
booster and to trigger some sort of automatic ejection. Preliminary agreements 
on a design for an abort or safety system began early in good accord. But the 
uncertain reliability program, booster recovery proposal, capsule design 
changes, and electrical interface problems fouled the subsequent development of 
the Redstone abort-sensing system.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> 
In this respect the Atlas was more nearly ready than the Redstone by the end of 
the year.
<P>Many factors contributed to the slippage in the Mercury-Redstone schedule, 
but one significant cause for delay grew out of a subtle difference between ABMA 
and STG in their approach to pilot safety and reliability. The role of the 
astronaut was clearly at issue here longer than anywhere else. Conditioned by 
their designs for Project Adam, the Huntsville rocketmen thought of the 
astronaut throughout 1959 as merely an "occupant" or "passenger." The Adam 
proposal for an escape system during off-the-pad aborts would have ejected a 
biopack capsule laterally into a tank of water alongside the launch pad. Having 
less trust than STG in the reliability of "Old Reliable," the Redstone engineers 
insisted on putting safety first and making it fully automatic wherever 
possible. Reliability, they insisted, is only a concept and should be secondary 
to safety. This attitude was illustrated in the introductory paragraphs of the 
ABMA proposal for the Redstone emergency detection system. The author, Fred W. 
Brandner, began by saying that the use of missiles for transporting man would 
demand an automatic escape system to assure pilot safety: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This system has to rely on emergency sensors. There are an 
  enormous number of missile components which may conceivably fail. Obviously, 
  it would be impractical and actually unsafe to clutter up the missile with 
  emergency sensors. However, many malfunctions will lead to identical results, 
  and, in sensing these results and selecting the proper quantities, one can 
  reduce the number of sensors to a few basic types.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>[173] 
Brandner proposed to measure only three basic quantities: the control system 
attitude and angular velocity, the 60-volt control and 28-volt general 
electrical power supplies, and the chamber pressure of the propulsion system. To 
ensure "a high degree of passenger (pilot) safety" on the Mercury-Redstone 
rocket, if operational limits set on these sensors should ever be exceeded the 
capsule would eject from the booster and be lowered by parachute.
<P>Brandner's modest proposal stated the issue but not the solution to the 
general question of man-machine relationships in Project Mercury. In 1959 the 
technical debate was still inextricably mixed up with previous attitudes toward 
the precise role of man in a manned satellite. Could the pilot test the vehicle 
or should the vehicle test the pilot? Mercury was NASA's program and STG's 
responsibility, but at this stage of development the military establishment and 
missile industries still knew, or thought they knew, more about the 
technological path for man's first climb into space than NASA-STG did.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>[174] From the Pentagon, for example, Brigadier General Homer A. Boushey, 
Director of Advanced Technology for the Air Force, had predicted in January that 
the most important key to space flight in the next decade would be not simply 
manned but rather piloted spacecraft: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>By piloted spacecraft, I refer to a vehicle wherein the pilot 
  operates controls and directs the vehicle. This is quite a different concept 
  from the so-called man-in-space proposal which merely takes a human "along for 
  the ride" to permit observation of his reactions and assess his capabilities. 
  The high-speed flight experience of the NACA and the Air Force has shown that 
  piloted craft return research data more effectively and more economically than 
  do unmanned vehicles. While there is a place, certainly, for automatic, 
  instrumented vehicles, I believe man himself will prove "the essential 
  payload" to the full utilization of space. Orbital rendezvous, controlled 
  landing after reentry, and space missions other than the simplest sensing and 
  reporting type, will require man. If for no other reason than that of 
  reliability, man will more than pay his way.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Boushey's 
percipient remarks illustrated the persistent residue of misunderstanding 
remaining from interagency competition for the manned satellite project in the 
pre-NASA, pre-Mercury period. Task Group officials felt compelled to defend the 
distinctive nature of Mercury and to emphasize that NASA astronauts were never 
intended to be passive passengers. Rather, they were to prove their full 
potential as pilots, within limits prescribed by the mission requirements 
programmed into the automatic systems. Although there were long and hard 
arguments within STG as to whether man should be considered "in the loop" or 
"out of the loop" in performing various tasks, the preponderance of NACA-bred 
aeronautical engineers in STG usually voted for as active an astronaut as 
possible. 
<P>Outside pressures from scientists and missile engineers also helped unify and 
consolidate opinion within STG. The distinguished research chief of Bell 
Telephone Laboratories and one of the fathers of communication satellites, John 
R. Pierce, summed up the argument for automation: "All we need to louse things 
up completely is a skilled space pilot with his hands itching for the 
controls."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>The problem of man-rating the Atlas was preoccupying another task force of 
still larger proportions than the one concerned with the Redstone. The 
industrial and military engineers in southern California and at the Cape who 
were trying to make the Atlas meet its design specifications could and did 
mobilize more resources than either STG or ABMA could command. A few individuals 
stood out as leaders in the vast effort. Kuettner's counterpart for the AirForce 
was Bernhard A. Hohmann, another former test pilot at Peenemuende West, who had 
been project engineer on the first two models of the Messerschmitt-163, one of 
the first rocket-powered aircraft. In August 1959, Major General Osmond J. 
Ritland of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division (BMD) assigned him the job 
of supervising the systems engineering at Space Technology Laboratories (STL) 
for a pilot safety and reliability program on the Mercury-Atlas series. As 
Brandner did for the Redstone, D. Richard White, an STL electronics engineer, 
[175] made the preliminary designs for the Atlas emergency detection system. 
White was inspired, he said, "one Sunday in May when I imagined myself sitting 
atop that bird." Edward B. Doll, STL's Atlas project manager, could never 
imagine anyone foolish enough to sit on an Atlas, but he allowed Hohmann and 
White to proceed with their commitments.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> 
STL performed an overall technical direction over the associate contractors for 
the Atlas similar to that performed by STG for NASA, but with significant 
differences. STL had not been involved in the original MX-774 design behind the 
Atlas, and although it became closely associated with conceptual development of 
Atlas as a weapon, ultimate responsibility remained with the Air Force Ballistic 
Missile Division. Both STL and STG were systems engineering organizations, but 
STG had a deeper background in research and was directly responsible for the 
development of the project it managed; STL had broader experience in systems 
engineering, missile development, and business management.
<P>Hohmann and his assistant, Ernst R. Letsch, huddled closely with the 
reliability statisticians at STL, led by Harry R. Powell, and with BMD's Mercury 
project liaison officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Brundin, also appointed by 
Ritland in August 1959. But the main responsibility for detail design, 
development, and production work fell on the shoulders of the manufacturers, 
General Dynamics (formerly Convair)/Astronautics (GD/A or CV/A) of San Diego. 
The details, tooling, and implementation of the emergency detection or abort 
sensing system for the Atlas were guided by Charles E. Wilson, Tom E. 
Heinsheimer, and Frank Wendzel. Their boss, Philip E. Culbertson, the Mercury 
project manager for General Dynamics/Astronautics, conferred repeatedly and 
sometimes heatedly with Hohmann, Brundin, Doll, and his own factory production 
engineers, John Hopman, Gus Grossaint, Frank B. Kemper, and R. W. Keehn.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>Here, too, a triangular dialogue was going on during initial considerations 
for man-rating the Atlas. But STG engineers were far away, busy with other 
matters, and knew well how little they knew about the Atlas. NASA and the Air 
Force, like STG and the Army, informally had agreed to divide developmental 
responsibility and labor at the capsule-separation point in the trajectory. So 
STG was not directly involved in the tripartite workings of the so-called 
"BMD-STL-GD/A complex" in southern California.
<P>Looking at Project Mercury from the West Coast in 1959 gave a set of very 
different perspectives on the prospects for accomplishing the program on time 
and in style. South of Los Angeles International Airport there was no consensus 
and precious little communication of the confidence felt across the continent on 
the coast of Virginia. But STL, Convair, and Air Force representatives at the 
Cape gradually diffused some of the contagious enthusiasm of STG while commuting 
between home and field operations. More important still, the sense of desperate 
military urgency to develop an operational ICBM still pervaded the factories and 
offices devoted to the Atlas in southern California. Motivation already 
mobilized might easily be transferred if only the Atlas could be proved by the 
end [176] of the year. STG was more sanguine about this forthcoming proof than 
the Atlas people, and NASA Headquarters seemed even more optimistic.
<P>Perhaps symbolic of the profound Air Force distrust of the "bare Atlas" 
approach and indicative of lingering doubts about the competence of the STG 
neophytes who had stolen the march on man in space was the acronymic name 
imposed by Air Force officers on the abort sensing system. White and Wilson 
wanted to call it simply the Atlas "abort sensing system." No, someone in 
authority insisted, let's make the name more appropriate to STG's plans to use 
the Atlas "as is."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> 
So this play on words, "<I>A</I>bort <I>S</I>ensing and <I>I</I>mplementation 
<I>S</I>ystem," became the designator for the only part of the Atlas created 
solely for the purpose of man-rating that missile. Reliability was truly 
designed into the "ASIS"; once this component was proven and installed, the 
Atlas ICBM should, it was hoped, be electromechanically transformed into the 
Mercury-Atlas launch vehicle.
<P>[177] Astronaut Donald K. Slayton defended his prospective role and STG's 
stance on the issue of automation when he addressed his brethren in the Society 
of Experimental Test Pilots on October 9. By his own admission, these were some 
"stubborn, frank" words: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>First, I would like to establish the requirement for the pilot.... 
  Objections to the pilot range from the engineer, who semi-seriously notes that 
  all problems of Mercury would be tremendously simplified if we didn't have to 
  worry about the bloody astronaut, to the military man who wonders whether a 
  college-trained chimpanzee or the village idiot might not do as well in space 
  as an experienced test pilot. The latter is associating Mercury with the Air 
  Force MISS or Army Adam programs which were essentially man in a barrel 
  approaches. The answer to the engineer is obvious and simple. If you eliminate 
  the astronaut, you can see man has no place in space. This answer doesn't 
  satisfy the military skeptic, however, since he is not questioning the concept 
  of a man in space but rather what type man. I hate to hear anyone contend that 
  present day pilots have no place in the space age and that non-pilots can 
  perform the space mission effectively. If this were true, the aircraft driver 
  could count himself among the dinosaurs not too many years hence.
  <P>Not only a pilot, but a highly trained experimental test pilot is desirable 
  . . . as in any scientific endeavor the individual who can collect maximum 
  valid data in minimum time under adverse circumstances is highly desirable. 
  The one group of men highly trained and experienced in operating, observing, 
  and analyzing airborne vehicles is the body of experimental test pilots 
  represented here today. Selection of any one for initial space flights who is 
  not qualified to be a member of this organization would be equivalent to 
  selecting a new flying school graduate for the first flight on the B-70, as an 
  example. Too much is involved and the expense is too great.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Slayton's 
defense of Mercury before his professional colleagues outside NASA was echoed 
time and again in the next two years by NASA spokesmen. But many critics 
remained skeptical because it was obvious that Mercury was being designed to fly 
first without man. Flight controllers and electronics engineers who had 
specialized in ground control of supersonic interceptors and who had confidence 
in the reliability of remote control of automatic weapon systems were the least 
enthusiastic about allowing the pilots to have manual overrides. Christopher C. 
Kraft, Jr., the chief flight director for STG, preceded Slayton on the same 
program at the meeting of the experimental test pilots. He reviewed the range 
network to be provided and the operational plan to be used for the Mercury 
orbital mission. At that time, Kraft circumspectly avoided any public indication 
of his personal views on the role the astronaut would play, but years later he 
confessed his bias: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The real knowledge of Mercury lies in the change of the basic 
  philosophy of the program. At the beginning, the capabilities of Man were not 
  known, so the systems had to be designed to function automatically. But with 
  the addition of Man to the loop, this philosophy changed 180 degrees since 
  primary success of the mission depended on man backing up automatic equipment 
  that could fail.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source18"><SUP>18</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>[178] 
In public, the managers of NASA and of Mercury, who had to request funds and 
justify their actions before Congress and the people, appeared as optimistic as 
possible and pointed out what could be achieved with successful missions. 
Privately, they not only had doubts, they cultivated a group of professional 
pessimists whose job it was to consider every conceivable malevolent 
contingency. John P. Mayer, Carl R. Huss, and Howard W. Tindall, Jr., first led 
STG's Mission Analysis Branch and set a precedent for spending ten times as much 
effort on planning for abnormal missions as for normal ones.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>Although not always obvious to STG, there also were differences in attitudes 
within the space medicine fraternity. Since mid-1958, men like Siegfried J. 
Gerathewohl and George R. Steinkamp had led the school of thought that believed 
that man was more nearly machine-rated than machines were man-rated. Conversely, 
the chief of the space medicine division of the Air Force's School of Aviation 
Medicine, Colonel Paul A. Campbell, influentially asserted his belief that "in 
these past two or three years the situation has suddenly changed, and the 
machine capability has advanced far beyond man's capability."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-3.htm#source20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> 
Other biologists and medical college specialists also had doubts about the 
peculiar combination of stresses - from high to zero to high g loads - that the 
man in Mercury must endure. Whatever the majority medical opinion might have 
been, the Task Group felt itself beleaguered by bioastronautical specialists who 
wanted to "animal-rate" the spaceflight machines all the way from amoebas 
through primates before risking a man's life in orbit.
