<H1>Redstone and Atlas</H1>After the creation of a separate Air Force in 1947, 
the Army had continued rocket development, operating on the same assumption 
behind the German Army's research in the 1930s - that rocketry was basically an 
extension of artillery. In June 1950, Army Ordnance moved its team of 130 German 
rocket scientists and engineers from Fort Bliss at El Paso to the Army's 
Redstone Arsenal at Huntsville, Alabama, along with some 800 military and 
General Electric employees. Headed by Wernher von Braun, who later became chief 
of the Guided Missile Development Division at Redstone Arsenal, the Army group 
began design studies on a liquid-fueled battlefield missile called the Hermes 
C1, a modified V-2. Soon the Huntsville engineers changed the design of the 
Hermes, which had been planned for a 500-mile range, to a 200-mile rocket 
capable of high mobility for field deployment. The Rocketdyne Division of North 
American Aviation modified the Navaho booster engine for the new weapon, and in 
1952 the Army bombardment rocket was officially named "Redstone."<A

<P>Always the favorite of the von Braun group working for the Army, the Redstone 
was a direct descendant of the V-2. The Redstone's liquid-fueled engine burned 
alcohol and liquid oxygen and produced about 75,000 pounds of thrust. Nearly 70 
feet long and slightly under 6 feet in diameter, the battlefield missile had a 
speed at burnout, the point of propellant exhaustion, of 3,800 miles per hour. 
For guidance it utilized an all-inertial system featuring a gyroscopically 
stabilized platform, computers, a programmed flight path taped into the rocket 
before launch, and the activation of the steering mechanism by signals in 
flight. For control during powered ascent the Redstone depended on tail fins 
with movable rudders and refractory carbon vanes mounted in the rocket exhaust. 
The prime contract for the manufacture of Redstone test rockets went to the 
Chrysler Corporation. In August 1953 a Redstone fabricated at the Huntsville 
arsenal made a partially successful maiden flight of only 8,000 yards from the 
military's missile range at Cape Canaveral, Florida. During the next five years, 
37 Redstones were fired to test structure, engine performance, guidance and 
control, tracking, and telemetry.<A

<P>The second successful military rocket being developed in 1951 was an Air 
Force project, the Atlas. The long history of the Atlas, the first American [22] 
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM),<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source61"><SUP>61</SUP></A> 
began early in 1946, when the Air Materiel Command of the Army Air Forces 
awarded a study contract for a long-range missile to Consolidated Vultee 
Aircraft Corporation (Convair), of San Diego. By mid-year a team of Convair 
engineers, headed by Karel J. Bossart, had completed a design for "a sort of 
Americanized V-2," called "HIROC," or Project MX-774. Bossart and associates 
proposed a technique basically new to American rocketry (although patented by 
Goddard and tried on some German V-2s) - controlling the rocket by swiveling the 
engines, using hydraulic actuators responding to commands from the autopilot and 
gyroscope. This technique was the precursor of the gimbaled engine method 
employed to control the Atlas and other later rockets. In 1947, the Truman 
administration and the equally economy-minded Republican 80th Congress 
confronted the Air Force with the choice of having funds slashed for its 
intercontinental manned bombers and interceptors or cutting back on some of its 
advanced weapons designs. Just as the first MX-774 test vehicle was nearing 
completion, the Air Force notified Convair that the project was canceled. The 
Convair engineers used the remainder of their contract funds for static firings 
at Point Loma, California, and for three partially successful test launches at 
White Sands, the last on December 2, 1948.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
<P>From 1947 until early 1951 there was no American project for an 
intercontinental ballistic missile. The Soviet Union exploded her first atomic 
device in 1949, ending the United States' postwar monopoly on nuclear weapons. 
President Harry S. Truman quickly ordered the development of hydrogen-fusion 
warheads on a priority basis. The coming of the war in Korea the next year shook 
American self-confidence still further. The economy program instituted by 
Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson ended, and the military budget, including 
appropriations for weapons research, zoomed upward. The Army began its work 
leading to the Redstone, while the Air Force resumed its efforts to develop an 
intercontinental military rocket. In January 1951 the Air Materiel Command 
awarded Convair a new contract for Project MX-1593, to which Karel Bossart and 
his engineering group gave the name "Project Atlas."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source63"><SUP>63</SUP></A> 
Yet the pace of the military rocket program remained deliberate, its funding 
conservative.
<P>A series of events beginning in late 1952 altered this cautious approach. On 
November 1, at Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific, the Atomic Energy Commission 
detonated the world's first thermonuclear explosion, the harbinger of the 
hydrogen bomb. The device weighed about 60,000 pounds, certainly a much greater 
weight than was practicable for a ballistic missile payload. The next year, 
however, as a result of a recommendation by a Department of Defense study group, 
Trevor Gardner, assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force, set up a Strategic 
Missiles Evaluation Committee to investigate the status of Air Force long-range 
missiles. The committee, composed of nuclear scientists and missile experts, was 
headed by the famous mathematician John von Neumann. Specifically, Gardner asked 
the committee to make a prediction regarding weight as opposed to yield in 
nuclear payloads for some six or seven years hence. The [23] evaluation group, 
familiarly known as the "Teapot Committee," concluded that shortly it would be 
possible to build smaller, lighter, and more powerful hydrogen-fusion warheads. 
This in turn would make it possible to reduce the size of rocket nose cones and 
propellant loads and, with a vastly greater yield from the thermonuclear 
explosion, to eliminate the need for precise missile accuracy.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source64"><SUP>64</SUP></A> 
In February 1954 both the Strategic Missiles Evaluation Committee and the Rand 
Corporation, the Air Force-sponsored research agency, submitted formal reports 
predicting smaller nuclear warheads and urging that the Air Force give its 
highest priority to work on long-range ballistic missiles.
<P>Between 1945 and 1953 the yield of heavy fission weapons had increased 
substantially from the 20-kiloton bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Now, according to 
the Air Force's scientific advisers, lighter, more compact, and much more 
powerful hydrogen warheads could soon be realized. These judgments "completely 
changed the picture regarding the ballistic missile," explained General Bernard 
A. Schriever, who later came to head the Air Force ballistic missile development 
program, "because from then on we could consider a relatively low weight package 
for payload purposes."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source65"><SUP>65</SUP></A> 
This was the fateful "thermonuclear breakthrough."
<P>Late in March 1964 the Air Research and Development Command organized a 
special missile command agency, originally called the Western Development 
Division but renamed Air Force Ballistic Missile Division on June 1, 1957. Its 
first headquarters was in Inglewood, California; its first commander, Brigadier 
General Schriever. The Convair big rocket project gained new life in the winter 
of 1954-55, when the Western Development Division awarded its first long-term 
contract for fabrication of an ICBM. The awarding of the contract came in an 
atmosphere of mounting crisis and urgency. The Soviets had exploded their own 
thermonuclear device in 1953, and intelligence data from various sources 
indicated that they also were working on ICBMs to carry uranium and hydrogen 
warheads. Thus the Atlas project became a highest-priority "crash" program, with 
the Air Force and its contractors and subcontractors working against the 
fearsome possibility of thermonuclear blackmail.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source66"><SUP>66</SUP></A>
<P>Rejecting the Army-arsenal concept, whereby research and development and some 
fabrication took place in Government facilities, the Air Force left the great 
bulk of the engineering task to Convair and its associate contractors.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source67"><SUP>67</SUP></A> 
For close technical and administrative direction the Air Force turned to the 
newly formed Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, a private missile research firm, which 
established a subsidiary initially called the Guided Missiles Research Division, 
later Space Technology Laboratories (STL). With headquarters in Los Angeles, the 
firm was to oversee the systems engineering of the Air Force ICBM program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source68"><SUP>68</SUP></A>
<P>In November 1955, STL's directional responsibilities broadened to include 
work on a new Air Force rocket, the intermediate-range (1,800-mile) Thor, 
hastily designed by the Douglas Aircraft Company to serve as a stopgap nuclear 
deterrent until the intercontinental Atlas became operational. At the same time 
[25] Charles E. Wilson, Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower administration, 
gave the Army and Navy joint responsibility for developing the Jupiter, another 
intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), the engineering task for which went 
to the Army rocketmen at Redstone Arsenal. To expedite Jupiter development, the 
Army on February 1, 1956, established at Huntsville a Ballistic Missile Agency, 
to which Wernher von Braun and his Guided Missile Development Division were 
transferred. Later that year Wilson issued his controversial "roles and 
missions" memorandum, confirming Air Force jurisdiction over the operational 
deployment of intercontinental missiles, assigning to the Air Force sole 
jurisdiction over land-based intermediate-range weapons, restricting Army 
operations to weapons with ranges of up to 200 miles, and assigning ship-based 
IRBM's to the Navy. Partly as a result of this directive, but mainly because of 
the difficulty of handling liquid propellants at sea, the Navy withdrew from the 
Jupiter program and focused its interest on the Polaris, a solid-propellant 
rocket designed for launching from a submarine.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source69"><SUP>69</SUP></A>
<P>As it developed after 1954, the Air Force ballistic missile development 
program, proceeding under the highest national priority and the pressure of 
Soviet missilery, featured a departure from customary progressive practice in 
weapons management. The label for the new, self-conscious management technique 
adopted by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division - Space Technology 
Laboratories team was "concurrency." Translated simply, concurrency meant "the 
simultaneous completion of all necessary actions to produce and deploy a weapon 
system."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source70"><SUP>70</SUP></A> 
But in practice the management task - involving parallel advances in research, 
design, testing, and manufacture of vehicles and components, design and 
construction of test facilities, testing of components and systems, expansion 
and creation of industrial facilities, and the building of launch sites - seemed 
overwhelmingly complex. At the beginning of 1956 the job of contriving one ICBM, 
the Atlas, was complicated by the decision to begin work on the Thor and on the 
Titan I, a longer-range, higher-thrust, "second generation" ICBM.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source71"><SUP>7l</SUP></A>
<P>The basic problem areas in the development of the Atlas included structure, 
propulsion, guidance, and thermodynamics. Convair attacked the structural 
problem by coming up with an entirely different kind of airframe. The Atlas 
airframe principle, nicknamed the "gas bag," entailed using stainless steel 
sections thinner than paper as the structural material, with rigidity achieved 
through helium pressurization to a differential of between 25 and 60 pounds per 
square inch. The pressurized tank innovation led to a substantial reduction in 
the ratio between structure and total weight; the empty weight of the Atlas 
airframe was less than two percent of the propellant weight. Yet the Atlas, like 
an automobile tire or a football, could absorb very heavy structural loads.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source72"><SUP>72</SUP></A>
<P>For the Atlas powerplant the Air Force contracted with the Rocketdyne 
Division of North American Aviation. The thermonuclear breakthrough meant that 
the original five-engine configuration planned for the Atlas could be scrapped 
in favor of a smaller, three-engine design. Thus Rocketdyne could contrive a 
unique [26] side-by-side arrangement for the two booster and one sustainer 
engines conceived by Convair, making it possible to fire simultaneously all 
three engines, plus the small vernier engines mounted on the airframe, at 
takeoff. The technique of igniting the boosters and sustainer on the ground gave 
the Atlas two distinct advantages: ignition of the second stage in the upper 
atmosphere was avoided, and firing the sustainer at takeoff meant that smaller 
engines could be used. The booster engines produced 154,000 pounds of thrust 
each; the sustainer engine, 57,000 pounds; and the two verniers, 1,000 pounds 
each. The propellant for the boosters, sustainer, and verniers consisted of 
liquid oxygen and a hydrocarbon mixture called RP-1. The basic fuel and oxidizer 
were brought together by an intricate network of lines, valves, and 
often-troublesome turbopumps, which fed the propellant into the Atlas combustion 
chambers at a rate of about 1,500 pounds per second. The thrust of the "one and 
one-half stage" Atlas powerplant, over 360,000 pounds, was equivalent to about 
five times the horsepower generated by the turbines of Hoover Dam or the pull of 
1,600 steam locomotives.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source73"><SUP>73</SUP></A>
<P>The Atlas looked rather fat alongside the Army Redstone, the Thor, or the 
more powerful Titan. The length of the Atlas with its original Mark II blunt 
nose cone was nearly 76 feet; its diameter at the fuel-tank section was 10 feet, 
at its base, 16 feet. Its weight when fueled was around 260,000 pounds. Its 
speed at burnout was in the vicinity of 16,000 miles per hour, and it had an 
original design range of 6,300 miles, later increased to 9,000 miles.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source74"><SUP>74</SUP></A>
<P>The prototype Atlas "A" had no operating guidance system. The Atlases "B" 
through "D" employed a radio-inertial guidance system, wherein transmitters on 
the rocket sensed aerodynamic forces acting on the missile and sent radio 
readings to a computer on the ground, which calculated the Atlas' position, 
speed, and direction. Radio signals were then sent to the rocket and fed through 
its inertial autopilot to gimbal the booster and sustainer engines and establish 
the Atlas' correct trajectory. After the jettisoning of the outboard booster 
engines, the sustainer carried the Atlas to the desired velocity before cutting 
off, while the vernier engines continued in operation to maintain precise 
direction and velocity. At vernier cutoff the missile began its unguided 
ballistic trajectory. A few moments later the nose cone separated from the rest 
of the rocket and continued on a high arc before plunging into the atmosphere. 
Radio-inertial guidance, the system used on the Atlas D and in Project Mercury, 
had the advantage of employing a ground computer that could be as big as 
desired, thus removing part of the nagging Atlas weight problem.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source75"><SUP>75</SUP></A>
<P>By the mid-1950s the smaller thermonuclear warhead predicted by the Teapot 
Committee was imminent, so that the 360,000-pound thrust of the Atlas was plenty 
of energy to boost a payload of a ton and a half, over the 6,300-mile range. But 
while nose-cone size ceased to be a problem, the dilemma of how to keep the 
ICBM's destructive package from burning up as it dropped into the 
ever-thickening atmosphere at 25 times the speed of sound remained. At such 
speeds even the thin atmosphere 60 to 80 miles up generates tremendous 
frictional heat, which [27] increases rapidly as an object penetrates the denser 
lower air. The temperature in front of the nose-cone surface ultimately may 
become hotter than the surface of the Sun. The atmospheric entry temperatures of 
the intermediate-range Thor, Jupiter, and Polaris were lower than those of the 
Atlas, but even for these smaller-thrust vehicles the matter of payload 
protection was acute.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source76"><SUP>76</SUP></A>
<P>In the mid-fifties the "reentry problem" looked like the hardest puzzle to 
solve and the farthest from solution, not only for the missile experts but also 
for those who dreamed of sending a man into space and bringing him back. As von 
Kármán observed in his partially autobiographical history of aerodynamic 
thought, published in 1954:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any rocket returning from space travel enters the atmosphere with 
  tremendous speed. At such speeds, probably even in the thinnest air, the 
  surface would be heated beyond the temperature endurable by any known 
  material. This problem of the temperature barrier is much more formidable than 
  the problem of the sonic barrier.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source77"><SUP>77</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Years of concerted research by the military services, NACA, the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, and other organizations would be necessary before crews 
at Cape Canaveral, either preparing a missile shot or the launching of a manned 
spacecraft, could confidently expect to get their payload back through the 
atmosphere unharmed.
<P>The American ballistic missile program of the 1950s produced some remarkable 
managerial and engineering achievements. Eventually the United States would 
deploy-reliable ICBMs in larger numbers than the Soviet Union. Yet the fact 
remains that the Russians first developed such an awesome weapon, first tested 
it successfully, and first converted their larger ICBM for space uses.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source78"><SUP>78</SUP></A> 
Thus American missile developers fell short of what had to be their immediate 
goal - keeping ahead or at least abreast of the Soviets in advanced weaponry. 
Bureaucratic delays, proliferation of committees, divided responsibility, 
interservice rivalry, sacrificial attachment to a balanced budget, excessive 
waste and duplication, even for a "crash" program - these were some of the 
criticisms that missile contractors, military men, scientists, and knowledgeable 
politicians lodged against the Defense Department and the Truman and Eisenhower 
administrations. From 1953 to 1957, Secretaries of Defense Wilson and Neil H. 
McElroy presided over 11 major organizational changes pertaining directly to the 
missile program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source79"><SUP>79</SUP></A> 
"It was just like putting a nickel in a slot machine," recalled J. H. 
Kindelberger, chairman of the board of North American Aviation, on the 
difficulty of getting a decision from the plethora of Pentagon committees. "You 
pull the handle and you get a lemon and you put another one in. You have to get 
three or four of them in a row and hold them there long enough for them to say 
'Yes.' It takes a lot of nickels and a lot of time."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-5.htm#source80"><SUP>80</SUP></A> 
And even Schriever, certainly not one to be critical of the pace of missile 
development, admitted that "in retrospect you might say that we could have moved 
a little faster."<A

projectile fired along a ballistic, or high-arc, trajectory, reaching an 
altitude of several hundred miles before falling freely toward its target. Such 
a vehicle is to be distinguished from the jet-propelled guided missile, which is 
controlled throughout its flight, requires oxygen within the air for its 
propellant oxidizer, and can operate only within the atmosphere. Thus by 
definition a ballistic missile, which reaches well into space, is a rocket.

they are at Bell, and a number of other companies, and . . . my feeling is that 
these people, distributed to American industry, are doing equally as good a job 
for the United States as this one small group that are still assembled at the 
Redstone Arsenal." <I>Inquiry into Satellite and Missile Programs</I>, Part 2,

XII (Winter-Spring 1960-1961), 237-250. Parallel development of components had 
characterized numerous advances in 20th-century science and technology, of 
course, notably the Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bomb in the 
Second World War. (See Baxter, <I>Scientists Against Time</I>, 419-447; and 
Richard G. Hewlett and Oscar E. Anderson, <I>A History of the United 
States Atomic Energy Commission</I>, Vol. I: <I>The New World</I>, 1939-1946 
[University Park, Pa., 1962], 9-407.) But "concurrency" as a formal research and 
engineering management technique is properly credited to the Air Force ballistic 
missile program of the fifties.

with the "E" version, the guidance system of the Atlas became all-inertial, 
meaning that all guidance components were carried aboard the rocket. General 
Electric and Burroughs Corp. developed the radio-inertial guidance system for 
the Atlas, while the American Bosch Arma Corp. produced the all-inertial system.

<P><A name=source76><SUP>76</SUP></A>Atmospheric entry heating was not a 
critical problem for the medium-range (200-mile) Redstone, which did not develop 
the velocities of the intermediate and intercontinental rockets. Thus protecting 
the astronaut during the reentry phase of the suborbital (Redstone) flights in 
Project Mercury, while deserving attention, was not of acute concern.

<P><A name=source77><SUP>77</SUP></A>Von Kármán, <I>Aerodynamics</I>, 189. In 
view of the continually modifying nature of astronautical terminology, the 
authors throughout this work have used the terms "entry" and "reentry" 
interchangeably. They realize that some aerodynamicists make a distinction 
between the two.
<P>
<P><A name=source78><SUP>78</SUP></A>Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, the now-famous 
Russian "master spy" for the West in the Soviet intelligence system, supposedly 
wrote as late as the first part of 1962: "Only the smaller (IRBM) missiles are 
in production.... Right now we have a certain number of missiles with nuclear 
warheads capable of reaching the United States or South America; but these are 
single missiles, not in mass production, and they are far from perfect." (Frank 
Gibney, ed., <I>The Penkovsky Papers</I>, trans. Peter Deriabin [Garden City, 
N.Y., 1965], 331-348.) Thus while the Soviets may have been able to fire an 
ICBM over its design range before the United States and use it to launch 
relatively heavy satellites, they apparently had great troubles producing such a 
military rocket in quantity, as the United States was doing by 1962 with its 
Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman.
