<H1>MA-2: Trussed Atlas Qualifies the Capsule</H1>So long and anguished had been 
the time since July 29, 1960, when the first Mercury-Atlas combination had 
exploded out of sight overhead, that members of the Mercury-Atlas launch team 
from STG were most eager to try to fly MA-2. Laboratory and wind tunnel tests of 
the "belly band," or "horse collar," in late January were practically prejudged 
as offering no ill omens. On Inauguration Day, January 20, 1961, Robert R. 
Gilruth, Charles J. Donlan, Williams, Maxime A. Faget, Mathews, William M. 
Bland, Jr., and Purser had attended an important meeting of the STG senior staff 
to decide what to do about MA-2. The preliminary recommendations of the 
Rhode-Worthman Committee were reconsidered; after more technical talks STG 
decided to accept the risk and proceed with the trussed Atlas for MA-2 if top 
NASA management could be persuaded. While a speedup of the flight schedule 
leading to the orbital mission and of plans for a program to follow after 
Mercury's manned 18-orbit mission were being discussed at length, the STG senior 
staff advised NASA Headquarters that MA-2 could wait no longer.<A

<P>A few days later the basic mission directive document appeared in its third 
revised edition; in turn it was superseded by a fourth edition and by a 
technical information summary. At the end of January, Robert Seamans and Abe 
Silverstein of Headquarters accepted Gilruth's STG recommendation to fly MA- 2. 
Before the middle of February preparations were complete. NASA had become 
convinced, but the Air Force was not sure MA-2 should fly yet. This was a 
hazardous and complex decision, shared by a number of people in Washington, at 
Langley, St. Louis, Los Angeles, and San Diego.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-4.htm#source48"><SUP>48</A></SUP> 
On February 17, Seamans called Rhode at Convair, asking his technical judgment 
as to MA-2's chances for success with its "belly-band fix." Rhode replied that 
MA-2 was structurally [320] ready within acceptable wind velocities at launch.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-4.htm#source49"><SUP>49</A></SUP> 
George M. Low reported to the new Administrator, James Webb, that MA-2 was 
scheduled for launch on February 21 at 8 a.m.: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Atlas 67-D will be the launch vehicle for this test. This is the 
  last of the "thin-skinned" Atlases to be used in the Mercury program. It 
  differs from the booster used in the MA-1 test in that the upper part of the 
  Atlas has been strengthened by the addition of an 8-inch-wide stainless steel 
  band. This band will markedly decrease the stresses of the weld located just 
  below the adapter ring on top of the Atlas; the high stress region is shifted 
  by about 8 inches, to a point where the allowable stresses are considerably 
  higher. In addition to this strengthening of the top section of the Atlas, the 
  bracing on the oxygen vent valve, which fits into the top of the Atlas tank, 
  has been changed. The adapter between the Atlas and the capsule has also been 
  stiffened.
  <P>
  <CENTER>* * * * * *</CENTER>
  <P>The Atlas will be cut off prematurely at a velocity of about 18,000 feet 
  per second. The resulting trajectory will yield the most severe reentry 
  conditions that could occur during an abort in an orbital launching.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-4.htm#source50"><SUP>50</A></SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Webb 
and Seamans, pressed by Air Force worries over the technical, political, and 
public effects if MA-2 should fail, decided to trust the judgment of Rhode and 
Gilruth and to back NASA's commitment to accept all the blame if the worst 
should happen. Timely decisions by NASA had been required to permit deployment 
of the recovery forces to maintain the scheduled launch date.
<P>There was so much concern over the Atlas-Mercury compatibility problem that 
many people almost forgot the first of several first-order objectives for the 
capsule and its booster. That was to test the integrity of the structure, 
ablation shield, and afterbody shingles of the capsule for reentry from the most 
critical abort situation. A second first-order objective required the Atlas 
abort sensing and implementation system (ASIS) to be operated "closed-loop" on 
the Mercury-Atlas configuration for the first time. But because MA-2 had already 
been made into a Federal test case, with the President, Congress, and top 
echelons in the Pentagon and NASA Headquarters vitally interested in its 
outcome, the engineers at the working levels were more anxious than ever to make 
this one go. Its specific results were politically less important than its 
general appearance of success.
<P>The preflight checkouts had ticked off nicely the last several days before 
capsule No. 6 was to undergo its ordeal. And spirits were rising with the Sun on 
the morning of February 21, 1961. The Mercury crew for launch operations was 
much the same as that for MR-2, but just as Atlas was an entirely different 
vehicle from the Redstone, so was its military/industrial launch operations crew 
quite different. From the factory in San Diego had come most of the senior 
engineers in the Mercury booster program office, including Philip E. Culbertson, 
Charles S. Ames, Howard Neumann, Joseph A. Moore, and Richard W. Keehn, as well 
as the same machinists, welders, and test supervisors who had made the "horse 
collar" work in bench and tunnel tests in California. At the Cape they [321] 
worked alongside the executive agent for Mercury-Atlas launchings, the 6555th 
Aerospace Test Wing of the Air Force, and with Thomas O'Malley and Calvin D. 
Fowler, who had the industrial responsibility for actual launch operations of 
the Atlas. The Air Force Ballistic Missile Division representatives, Lieutenant 
Colonel R. H. Brundin and Major C. L. Gandy, together with Aerospace engineers 
Bernhard Hohmann and Ernst R. Letsch, were also on hand, watching final 
preparations to make this "bird" fly. Their special concern with the design and 
implementation of the chief reliability component of the Atlas, namely the abort 
system or "ASIS," also brought Charles Wilson and J. W. Schaelchlin of Convair/ 
Astronautics, and D. R. White of Space Technology Laboratories, into the 
blockhouse of Launch Complex 14 on this special morning. John J. Williams was 
the Mercury-Atlas test conductor presiding there.
<P>Engineers and workers at lower levels in the industrial and military 
hierarchy were beginning to call all these senior men "tigers" and to speak of 
them collectively as "tiger teams." They were the senior designers and the 
old-line specialists on Atlas subsystems who came out to the launch site to help 
the field engineers actually doing the work of final preparation for a launch.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-4.htm#source51"><SUP>51</A></SUP> 
Walter Williams and Christopher Kraft, in the Mercury Control Center about three 
miles southwest of the beach-side launch pad, watched the lights turn green one 
by one as the gantry backed away and "loxing" commenced about 7:30 a.m. The 
weather was perfect at the Cape, but 1200 miles downrange in the recovery area 
there were scattered squalls, which delayed the launch for one hour. Outside the 
Control Center that day stood Gilruth, Low, and Major General Ritland of the Air 
Force Ballistic Missile Division, waiting and watching for the liftoff. Each had 
prepared press releases in his pocket making this shot a NASA "overload" test in 
case of failure.
<P>MA-2 roared off its pad at 9:12 a.m., and for the next 2 minutes the tiger 
teams and the managers of Mercury hardly dared breathe. An audible sigh of 
relief spread through the Control Center and blockhouse about one minute after 
liftoff, when it was announced that the "horse-collared" booster had gone 
through max q intact and was accelerating. At that point, said Low, "Gilruth 
became a young man again." Telemetry verified "BECO" and the staging of the 
booster engines, escape tower separation, a good trajectory, capsule separation, 
capsule retrofire attitude, retrorocket firing, and retropackage jettison.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-4.htm#source52"><SUP>52</A></SUP> 
Capsule entry attitude looked excellent at the time tracking and telemetry were 
lost, because of extreme range, about 9:22 a.m. Three minutes later, lookouts 
aboard the uprange destroyer <I>Greene</I> reported observing the reentry of 
both capsule No. 6 and Atlas booster No. 67-D. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The capsule passed directly overhead and was lost in the sun at 
  09:37. Reentry was clearly visible and the capsule could be seen ahead of the 
  booster tankage. The capsule was not glowing but a distinct smoke trail was 
  seen streaming behind it. The booster tankage was glowing with an intense 
  white glow. Several fragments appeared to be traveling along with the tankage 
  [322] and tumbling at a high rate. One of the ship's observers tracked the 
  reentry on a gun mount and indicated a separation distance between the capsule 
  and tankage of 50 miles when it passed overhead.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-4.htm#source53"><SUP>53</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>The 
landing ship dock <I>Donner</I>, almost at the center of the 20-by-40-mile 
elliptical dispersion area, also sighted the reentry but lost sight over the 
horizon northeastward before the parachute descent. Within 10 minutes, however, 
radio signals from the sarah beacon pinpointed the floating capsule's locations, 
and helicopters were dispatched to pick it up after only 24 minutes in the 
water. It was returned to the LSD less than one hour after launch.
<P>MA-2 was a magnificent flight, "nominal in nearly every respect." This second 
mission followed a flight path essentially the same as that for MA-1. The 
Atlas-Mercury compatibility problem had been resolved, the sequence system for 
the booster/capsule combination had worked perfectly, and the tracking and 
real-time data transmission had given immediate and excellent impact prediction 
from the computers at Goddard to the control centers at the Cape and on Bermuda 
and to the recovery forces at sea. The capsule was in extremely good condition, 
its ablation heatshield being charred no worse than that for Big Joe, its 
afterbody shingles neither burned nor warped. The Space Task Group was 
pleasantly surprised to find the jettisoned antenna canister and to learn, even 
more surprisingly, that the "mousetrap" aerodynamic destabilizing flap had not, 
as expected, burned away.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-4.htm#source54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
<P>At a press conference later that day, Gilruth beamed as he announced that 
this was "a very successful test" that "gives us new confidence in the integrity 
of the system, although I would like to caution you all that there are still a 
number of critical tests that have to be made before we contemplate manned 
orbital flight." Asked if a man could have survived this flight, Gilruth said 
yes. When asked whether this flight also would aid the Mercury-Redstone program, 
Gilruth again gave an affirmative answer, stressing the identical nature of the 
capsule electrical, power, abort, and parachute systems. The Earth-fixed maximum 
velocity of the MA-2 capsule had been approximately 12,000 miles per hour, the 
highest velocity achieved by a Mercury launch since <I>Big Joe</I> had 
demonstrated the boiler plate model of the Mercury concept. As a cap stone for 
this happy occasion, Gilruth read a statement announcing that three out of the 
seven astronauts, namely "Glenn, Grissom and Shepard, in alphabetical order," 
had been selected to begin concentrated preparations for the initial manned 
Mercury space flights. The nominees had known about and been in training for 
their missions since January, but most Mercury engineers did not know who was 
assigned to which flight.<A
