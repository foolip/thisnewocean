<H1>Technical Sprint for Man in Space</H1>Although election year reexaminations 
and premonitions of the Soviet Vostoks were disconcerting, these were the least 
of the conscious worries of the men teamed in the technological harness to get a 
Mercury astronaut off the ground. They still had a plenitude of more prosaic 
problems of their own. The inexorable growth of the capsule weight, the marginal 
performance of the Atlas as a launch vehicle, interface wiring and structural 
problems, and the worrisome reaction and environmental controls for the capsule 
were outstanding. On the other hand, some problems, like thermal protection 
during atmospheric entry and the physiological effects of weightlessness for a 
short period, were assumed solved for the moment.
<P>Benjamine J. Garland, one of Faget's fellow authors of the seminal 1958 NACA 
paper for Mercury, prepared a special report for Gilruth on the probability of 
damage to the capsule by micrometeoroids during an orbital flight. Garland 
advised that the danger to the capsule during an orbital flight from sporadic 
meteoroid activity was very small. He calculated probabilities of hits during a 
major meteoroid shower and found the danger was "still small but . . . [287] an 
order of magnitude greater than the danger due to the sporadic background. Since 
the periods of activity of the major showers are known, it is possible to avoid 
operations during these periods and would be advisable to do so."<A

<P>Because qualification and reliability tests on the retrograde and posigrade 
rocket systems proved disappointing in their later results, Gilruth's team 
called for help from the Ames and Lewis Research Centers. Robert R. Nunemaker 
led a group at Lewis, monitored by John B. Lee of STG, who found some serious 
difficulties with retrorocket alignment and escape tower separation. Among other 
things, they found that some igniters were faulty and that the jettisoning of 
the escape tower under certain conditions might permit a smashing recontact.
<P>But the most serious problem with capsule systems at this time was the 
outside chance that one or more of the three retrograde braking rockets might 
fail. There was considerable margin for error in the design of the retropackage, 
but there was no emergency braking system. STG's mission analysis group under 
John P. Mayer had thoroughly investigated an inflatable balloon for this 
purpose, and Gilruth himself proposed an emergency brake-that would have looked 
like a Chinese dragon kite trailing in the wake of the orbiting capsule. This 
auxiliary drag device to back up the retrosystem and to bring the capsule down 
sooner than in the 24 hours theoretically required for a normal decay of 
Mercury's orbit was independently appraised by Howard K. Larson and others at 
Ames. Meanwhile John Glenn and the other astronauts asked STG's mission analysts 
to study the effectiveness of a "fish-tailing" maneuver as a backup reentry mode 
of last resort. Both ideas were reported feasible, but the former was not 
pursued past the end of the year, when the reliability of the retrorockets and 
pyrotechnics began to rise appreciably.<A

<P>Among the number of unsolved problems regarding man-machine integration in 
late 1960, the complex final phase of the mission profile aroused much concern. 
If an astronaut could survive launch, insertion, orbiting, reentry, and the 
free-fall, nothing must jeopardize his chances to survive impact, exit from the 
capsule, and recovery. But as the capsule developed into flight hardware, the 
differences between its theoretical design and its measurable performance 
required constant restudy, redesign, and in some cases redevelopment.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-5.htm#source57"><SUP>57</A></SUP> 
While studying the Mercury capsule's stability in water, for example, Peter J. 
Armitage and E. N. Harrin of STG found that the deletion of the flotation bags 
and the addition of the impact skirts had seriously compromised the floating 
trim if not the seaworthiness of the capsule.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-5.htm#source58"><SUP>58</A></SUP>
<P>After summarizing recent investigations by both McDonnell and STG engineers, 
Armitage and Harrin pointed out a number of unknowns and recommended close 
scrutiny of any changes to capsule center-of-gravity positions to keep the 
capsule within acceptable stability limits. While the model-makers at Langley 
were fabricating and testing 24 new impact skirts, Astronauts Shepard, Grissom, 
and Schirra practiced getting out of the capsule; it now listed at severe angles 
and sometimes even capsized.<A

<P>[288] During September 1960 all the Mercury astronauts began to train more 
pointedly for the Mercury-Redstone mission. Early in October they gathered their 
personalized couches, pressure suits, and accessories for centrifuge runs at the 
Navy's Aviation Medical Acceleration Laboratory at Johnsville, 
Pennsylvania.Fitted with a production handcontroller assembly and environmental 
control system, the gondola of the centrifuge whirled each man as if he were 
experiencing the calculated acceleration profile of the MR-3 flight. At 
Johnsville the astronauts gained experience in attitude and rate control, 
monitored the normal sequencing functions, and learned to cope with emergency 
conditions like overacceleration and decompression. Alan Shepard, for instance, 
took 10 training "flights" during the October session.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-5.htm#source60"><SUP>60</A></SUP>
<P>On September 8, 1960, Silverstein called to Washington NASA's and McDonnell's 
chief engineers at work on Mercury to discuss plans for compressing the 
Mercury-Redstone schedule by expediting the capsule systems tests and checkout 
procedures for capsules Nos. 5 and 7, to be flown on MR-2 and MR-3, 
respectively. Once again Silverstein asked that McDonnell assign independent 
systems engineers to verify all hardware installations. Especially they were to 
improve the quality of capsule No. 7 before the formal systems testing period. 
This was done during October and November; for 43 days No. 7 underwent 
performance trials of all its systems except its reaction controls, automatic 
stabilization controls, and instrumentation and communications gear. McDonnell, 
Navy, and STG liaison inspectors tried hard to meet Silverstein's Cape delivery 
deadline of November 15, but two major discrepancies could not be allowed to 
pass. One problem had been perennial: overheating DC/AC inverters. 
Investigations disclosed that as long as the ambient temperature was kept below 
165 degrees F they functioned properly. McDonnell attempted to cure this 
overheating problem by replacing the honeycombed inverter sockets with aluminum 
shelves that doubled as heat sinks.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-5.htm#source61"><SUP>61</A></SUP>
<P>The second problem was new: tiny cracks were noticed in the outer titanium 
skin of the capsule pressure vessels. Samples of fractured material were sent to 
the Battelle Memorial Institute, an endowed foundation for applied scientific 
research, at Columbus, Ohio. Battelle found that the heated zones adjacent to 
the seam welds contained an excessive amount of precipitated hydrides, compounds 
of hydrogen and other elements. These impurities lowered the ductility of the 
skin of the pressure vessel, increased leakage rates, and increased the danger 
of structural collapse upon impact. But since capsule No. 7 had the best record 
of all in the capsule systems tests, it passed muster to begin its final factory 
shakedown tests on November 21, 1960. For later capsules, welding methods, 
vibration testing, and microscopic inspections were improved, but the 
long-standing "skin-cracking" problem required that the search be renewed for 
ways to eliminate hydride formations near the beads of fusion welds.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-5.htm#source62"><SUP>62</A></SUP>
<P>On December 1, 1960, Jerome B. Hammack, the MR-3 project engineer for STG, 
and his assistant, James T. Rose, certified that capsule No. 7 was ready for 
[289] its manned mission, though some 20 days behind schedule. "The writers 
would like to stress that the majority of time spent during this period was 
spent on correction and rework rather than the actual CST and that every effort 
should be made in the future to achieve manufacturing perfection prior to the 
capsule entering CST."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-5.htm#source63"><SUP>63</A></SUP>
<P>Meanwhile capsule No. 2, being readied for the first Mercury-Redstone flight, 
was delivered to the Cape at the beginning of August. This flight, MR-1, was 
then scheduled for launching early in October. Both McDonnell and STG preflight 
checkout crews in Hangar S worked around the clock to make ready the maze of 
systems in their capsule. Christopher Kraft talked over Mercury command 
functions with the Redstone launch team under Debus and with Air Force range 
safety officer Lieutenant Colonel R. D. Stephens early in September. They then 
decided to fly the MR-1 mission with the automatic abort system in the open-loop 
mode to lessen any possibility of a nuisance abort on this qualification flight.
<P>On a trial basis, a smaller Flight Safety Review Board for the spacecraft 
(tailored after the Atlas boards by the same name), chaired by Walter Williams 
and consisting of Astronaut Cooper, F. J. Bailey, Jr., Kenneth S. Kleinknecht, 
and William M. Bland, Jr., was established at the Cape to pass final judgment 
during the week before the countdown on the readiness of the mission. During the 
first week in October, final preparations were made to launch MR-1, and on the 
morning of October 9, 1960, an unbroken countdown proceeded to within 22 minutes 
of launchtime before the shot was scrubbed because of a malfunction in the 
capsule reaction control system.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-5.htm#source64"><SUP>64</A></SUP>
<P>[290] By the first of November both LJ-5 and MR-1 appeared ready for 
launching on November 7, 1960. But both launches had to be postponed again (the 
day before the election) because of inclement weather at Wallops Island and 
because at the Cape a serious leak developed in the helium tank of capsule No. 
2. Without helium to pressurize the hydrogen peroxide thrusters, the payload 
after posigrade release might not reorient itself properly for reentry. So heavy 
had the workload at the Cape become that Williams decreed a maximum of 12 hours' 
work for any one person in any one day.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-5.htm#source65"><SUP>65</A></SUP>
<P>The possible political significance of these launches now was seen by the 
press and by the legislative staffs on Capitol Hill and at NASA Headquarters. 
George Low's routine report for James P. Gleason, Assistant Administrator for 
Congressional Relations, carefully explained the technical reasons first for 
delay and then for speedup on the launch schedules. Regarding Little Joe 5, 
Gleason informed the staff director of the Senate space committee that NASA 
Headquarters was keeping close tabs on MR-1 scheduling information because of 
the need to coordinate interagency activity, but that Little Joe missions 
"requiring no major coordination with non-NASA organizations" had always been 
handled on a less formal basis: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>You will notice that the launch target date was delayed from 
  October 8, 1960, to November 11, 1960, at the time when it became apparent 
  that the capsule delivery would be delayed until about August 1, 1960. Between 
  August 17 and August 31, a large number of checkout difficulties was 
  encountered in the noise and vibration test program. It was then expected that 
  the capsule would not arrive at Wallops until October 5, and hence the launch 
  date was moved to November 16.
  <P>In the early part of September, the rate of progress at Langley picked up, 
  and the capsule was actually shipped to Wallops on September 27th. 
  Nevertheless, the projected launch date was not moved to an earlier date, 
  since simultaneous experience with MR-1 at Cape Canaveral gave every 
  indication that the prelaunch checkout would take longer than planned.
  <P>In actual practice, the Wallops Island checkout ran very smoothly. 
  Accordingly, a new target date of November 7 was established late in October. 
  Barring difficulties during the final checkout period, and assuming that the 
  weather will be clear and calm, the launching will take place on that date.
  <P>. . . I feel that our project engineers have done an excellent job at 
  predicting these dates; it is very seldom that actual dates on as complex a 
  research and development program as this one have come out so close to the 
  predicted dates as these have.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-5.htm#source66"><SUP>66</A></SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Less 
out of sensitivity to the political winds than because the facts seemed to 
warrant it, the apolitical civil servants in the Task Group sent an encouraging 
status report on Project Mercury to their administrative superiors in Washington 
at the end of October 1960. There were a couple of negative items: the cause of 
the MA-1 failure was still unknown, and the checkout time at the Cape for 
capsule No. 2 for MR-1 was stretching interminably, it seemed. On the plus side, 
three capsules (Nos. 2, 5, and 6 for MR-1, MR-2, and MA-2, respectively) were on 
hand, and two more (Nos. 7 and 8 for MR- 3 and MA-3) were expected [291] at the 
Cape momentarily. The Mercury Control Center, a command-post building trisecting 
the area between the two blockhouses beside the launching pads and the 
industrial hangars, was open and almost ready for operations. Four preflight 
checkout trailers supplied by McDonnell were already in full use. Procedures 
Trainer No. 2 was being wired to its computer banks, and the ground-test 
qualification program seemed almost complete.
<P>The tracking and communications network was essentially finished, except for 
the stations at Kano, Nigeria, and on Zanzibar. The Atlas ASIS was looking good, 
and with luck the first truly complete Mercury-Atlas configuration, MA-2, still 
might possibly be flown during the quarter. Cost accounting for the program was 
still a black art, but according to STG's own estimates the summary of funds 
required to accomplish the Mercury mission as defined in October 1960 approached 
$110 million:<A
