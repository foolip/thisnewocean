<H1>Project Astronaut?</H1>Preliminary procedures for pilot selection had been 
worked out by the aeromedical consultants attached to the Space Task Group at 
Langley during November. Their plan called for a meeting with representatives 
from industry and the services to nominate a pool of 150 men from which 36 
candidates would be selected for physical and psychological testing. From this 
group 12 would be chosen to go through a nine-month training and qualification 
program, after which six finally would be expected to qualify.<A

<P>On the basis of this plan, Donlan from Langley, and North in Washington, 
together with Allen O. Gamble, a psychologist on leave from the National Science 
Foundation, drafted civil service job specifications for individuals who wished 
to apply for the position of "Research Astronaut-Candidate." One of the early 
plans outlined very well the original expectations of NASA and STG on the type 
of man thought necessary. NASA Project A, announcement No. 1, dated December 22, 
1958, was a draft invitation to apply for the civil service position of research 
astronaut-candidate "with minimum starting salary range of $8,330 to $12,770 
(GS-12 to GS-15) depending upon qualifications." This document called the manned 
ballistic satellite program "Project Astronaut," and the first section described 
the duties of the astronaut: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>[130] Although the entire satellite operation will be possible, in 
  the early phases, without the presence of man, the astronaut will play an 
  important role during the flight. He will contribute by monitoring the cabin 
  environment and by making necessary adjustments. He will have continuous 
  displays of his position and attitude and other instrument readings, and will 
  have the capability of operating the reaction controls, and of initiating the 
  descent from orbit. He will contribute to the operation of the communications 
  system. In addition, the astronaut will make research observations that cannot 
  be made by instruments; these include physiological, astronomical and 
  meteorological observations.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-8.htm#source52"><SUP>52</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>Only 
males between 25 and 40 years of age, less than 5 feet 11 inches in height, and 
with at least bachelor's degrees were to be considered. Stringent professional 
experience or graduate study requirements specified five patterns of career 
histories most desirable. Candidates who had either three years of work in any 
of the physical, mathematical, biological, or psychological sciences, or who had 
three years of technical or engineering work in a research and development 
program or organization might apply. Or anyone with three years of operation of 
aircraft, balloons, or submarines, as commander, pilot, navigator,communications 
officer, engineer, or comparable technical position, would be eligible, as would 
persons who had completed all requirements for the Ph.D. degree in any 
appropriate field of science or engineering plus six months of professional 
work. In the case of medical doctors, six months of clinical or research work 
beyond the license and internship or residency would be required. Furthermore, 
the job qualifications required proof that applicants had demonstrated recently 
their "(a) willingness to accept hazards comparable to those encountered in 
modern research airplane flight; (b) capacity to tolerate rigorous and severe 
environmental conditions; and (c) ability to react adequately under conditions 
of stress or emergency." The announcement added: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>These three characteristics may have been demonstrated in 
  connection with certain professional occupations such as test pilot, crew 
  member of experimental submarine or arctic or antarctic explorer. Or they may 
  have been demonstrated during wartime combat or military training. Parachute 
  jumping or mountain climbing or deep sea diving (including SCUBA) whether as 
  occupation or sport, may have provided opportunities for demonstrating these 
  characteristics, depending upon heights or depths obtained, frequency and 
  duration, temperature and other environment conditions, and emergency episodes 
  encountered. Or they may have been demonstrated by experience as an 
  observer-under-test for extremes of environmental conditions such as 
  acceleration, high or low atmospheric pressure, variation in carbon dioxide 
  and oxygen concentration, high and low ambient temperatures, etc. Many other 
  examples could be given. It is possible that the different characteristics may 
  have been demonstrated by separate types of experience.</BLOCKQUOTE>Finally, as 
a last check on ruling out the "lunatics" who might send in crank applications, 
this proposed plan for astronaut selection required that each applicant have the 
sponsorship of a responsible organization. A nomination form [131] appended to 
this announcement would have required 17 multi-point evaluations of the nominee 
by some official of the sponsoring institution.
<P>Clearly this astronaut selection plan was sober enough and stringent enough 
to ensure an exceptionally high quality applicant, but the plan itself was not 
approved and had to be abandoned. President Eisenhower during the 1958 Christmas 
holidays decided that the pool of military test pilots already in existence was 
quite sufficient a source from which to draw. Since certain classified aspects 
would inevitably be involved, military test pilots could most conveniently 
satisfy security considerations.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-8.htm#source53"><SUP>53</A></SUP>
<P>Although some in NASA regretted the incongruity of allowing volunteers for 
the civilian manned space program to be drawn only from the military, the 
decision that the services would provide the candidates greatly simplified pilot 
selection procedures. A meeting held at NASA Headquarters during the first week 
of January brought together W. Randolph Lovelace II, Brigadier General Don D. 
Flickinger, Low, North, Gilruth, and several other members of the Space Task 
Group. There the elaborate civil service criteria for selection were boiled down 
to a seven-item formula:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Age - less than 40. 
  <LI>Height - less than 5 feet, 11 inches. 
  <LI>Excellent physical condition. 
  <LI>Bachelor's degree or equivalent. 
  <LI>Graduate of test pilot school. 
  <LI>1,500 hours total flying time. 
  <LI>Qualified jet pilot.</LI></OL>When these criteria were given to the 
Pentagon, service record checks revealed more than 100 men on active duty who 
appeared to be qualified. The military services were pleased to cooperate in 
further screening. NASA was relieved not to have to issue an open invitation, 
and STG was pleased to have Headquarters' aid in the selection.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-8.htm#source54"><SUP>54</A></SUP>
<P>Contrary to the feeling expressed in some quarters, even among experimental 
test pilots, that the ballistic capsule pilot would be little more than "spam in 
a can," most members of STG believed from the beginning that their pilots would 
have to do some piloting. As George Low explained their views to Administrator 
Glennan, "These criteria were established because of the strong feeling that the 
success of the mission may well depend upon the actions of the pilot; either in 
his performance of primary functions or backup functions. A qualified jet test 
pilot appeared to be best suited for this task."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-8.htm#source55"><SUP>55</A></SUP> 
Exactly how much "piloting," in the traditional sense, man could do in orbit was 
precisely the point in issue.
<P>The least technical task facing NASA and its Space Task Group in the fall of 
1958 was choosing a name or short title for the manned satellite project. 
Customarily project names for aircraft and missiles were an administrative 
convenience best chosen early so as to guarantee general usage by contractors, 
press, [132] and public. Langley had earlier suggested to Headquarters three 
possible emblems or seals for the use of NASA as a whole: one would have had 
Phaeton pulling Apollo across the sky; another would have used the Great Seal of 
the United States encompassed by three orbital tracks; and a third proposed a 
map of the globe circled by three orbits. These proposals, as well as the name 
suggested by Space Task Group for the manned satellite project, lost out to 
symbols considered more appropriate in Washington. "Project Astronaut," 
preferred at first by Gilruth to emphasize the man in the satellite, was 
overruled largely because it might lead to overemphasis on the personality of 
the man.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-8.htm#source56"><SUP>56</A></SUP>
<P>Silverstein advocated a systemic name with allegorical overtones and neutral 
underpinnings: The Olympian messenger Mercury, denatured by chemistry, 
advertising, an automobile, and Christianity, was the most familiar of the gods 
in the Greek pantheon to Americans. Mercury, alias Hermes, the son of Zeus and 
grandson of Atlas, with his winged sandals and helmet and caduceus, was too rich 
in symbolic associations to be denied. The esteemed Theodore von Kármán had 
chosen to speak of Mercury, as had Lucian of Samosata, in terms of the "reentry" 
problem and the safe return of man to Earth.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-8.htm#source57"><SUP>57</A></SUP>
<P>Had a mythologist been consulted, perhaps the additional associations of 
Mercury with masterful thievery, the patronage of traders, and the divinity of 
commerce would have proven too humorous. But "Mercury," Glennan and Dryden 
agreed on November 26, 1958, was the name most appropriate for the manned 
satellite enterprise.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-8.htm#source58"><SUP>58</A></SUP>
<P>Greeks might worry about whether Mercury would function in his capacity as 
divine herald or as usher to the dead, but Americans, like the Romans, could be 
trusted not to worry. On Wright Brothers' Day, December 17, 1958, 55 years after 
the famous flights at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Glennan announced publicly in 
Washington that the manned satellite program would be called "Project 
Mercury."<A
