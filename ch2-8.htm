<H1>A Reason for Research</H1>During 1958, scientists and engineers, both 
military and civilian, talked more openly than they had in previous years about 
radiation dosages, meteoroid penetration, weightlessness, and the other 
anomalies of space travel. They received a considerably more respectful hearing. 
What made members of the Congress and Americans in general responsive to such 
discussions and interested in past research and future plans for space 
exploration were the ever-larger scientific satellites launched by the Soviet 
Union, beginning October 4, 1957. In the midst of the nationalistic humiliation 
following the Sputniks, not only space [53] rocketry but also medical research 
with rockets received an invaluable boost. In May 1958, Air Force physicians 
sent mice along on three reentry tests of the Able ablation nose cone for the 
Thor. Then, the following December and in May 1959, the Navy School of Aviation 
Medicine dispatched monkeys, sea-urchin eggs and sperm, molds, tissues, and 
seeds on two test firings of the Jupiter intermediate range missile, carried out 
by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency.<A

<P>The new focus on space, the new curiosity about what went on beyond the 
atmosphere, the determination to "catch up" in the space race - these sentiments 
redounded to the benefit of those Americans who had been trying to solve the 
biological and technological puzzles of manned space flight long before there 
was a space race. Their principal stimulus was not international prestige or the 
drive for technological supremacy; it was a desire to discover the undiscovered, 
to probe into the unknown. And they believed that wherever man's instruments 
went, man should follow. The proponents of manned space flight in the United 
States could be found in several locations - in the military, in some 
universities, in the aerospace industry, even in the Congress. But an especially 
zealous contingent worked for NACA. Ultimately its members would become the 
engineering and managerial nucleus of the American program to rocket a man into 
orbit around Earth and bring him back.
