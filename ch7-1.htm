<H1>Chapter 7</H1>
<H1>Man-Rating the Machines</H1>
<H2>(July - December 1959)</H2>[167] SADDLING ballistic missiles for manned 
space flight was in some respects like trying to ride Sinbad's roc: the bird was 
not built for a topside burden, and man was not meant for that sort of 
punishment. Once accepted in theory that this fabulous bird could be 
domesticated and that some men could tolerate, even enjoy, the strains and 
stresses of such a ride, practical questions of marrying the separate abilities 
of man and machine demanded immediate answers. Engineers in the Space Task Group 
and other NASA researchers at Langley, Lewis, and Ames were providing some of 
these answers; engineers and technicians in industry and in quasi-military 
organizations contributed equally important answers. The primary task of the 
Task Group managing Mercury was to ask the right questions and to insist on 
better answers from the industrial producers of the parts and from the academic, 
industrial, and military suppliers of services.
<P>In the latter half of 1959, as STG monitored the gathering momentum of the 
various manufacturers, the urgent search for ways to reduce the ultimate risk of 
sending a man for a ride in an artificial moon lifted by a missile gradually 
became more systematic and better organized. The theme of this chapter is the 
quest for reliability in the automatic machinery developed for the Mercury 
mission. Making these devices safe enough for man took longer and exposed more 
doubts than STG had expected originally. During the curiously quiet first half 
of 1960, the flexibility of the Mercury astronaut complemented and speeded the 
symbiosis of man and missile, of astronaut and capsule. Technology, or hardware, 
and techniques, or procedures - sometimes called "software" by hardware 
engineers - both had to be developed. But because they were equally novel, 
reliability had to be built into the new tools before dexterity could be 
acquired in their use.<A

<P>At the beginning of 1959 NASA Headquarters had worried about three scientific 
unknowns needing resolution before actual attempts to conduct manned [168] 
orbital flights. In their contribution to a House Committee Staff Report 
prognosticating for Congress on <I>The Next Ten Years in Space</I><I>, 
1959-1969</I>, Administrator T. Keith Glennan and the chief scientists at the 
helm of NASA in Washington listed these imperatives that must be investigated 
before man could go into space:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The problems known to exist include (1) high-energy radiation, 
  both primary and cosmic ray and the newer plasma type discovered in the IGY 
  satellite series; (2) man's ability to withstand long periods of loneliness 
  and strain while subjected to the strange environment of which weightlessness 
  is the factor least evaluated; and (3) reentry into the atmosphere and safe 
  landing. The reliability of the launching rocket must be increased before a 
  manned capsule is used as a payload. Once these basic questions have been 
  answered, then we can place a manned vehicle in orbit about the earth.<A

<P>By July 1959 the engineers in the Space Task Group were no longer concerned 
by the unknowns in each of these problematic areas. They had obviated the need 
for high-energy radiation shielding by selecting a circular orbit around the 
equatorial zone at an altitude between 80 and 120 miles, well above the 
stratosphere and well below the Van Allen belts. Loneliness would be no problem 
because the communications network would keep the astronaut in almost constant 
voice contact with ground crews. Weightlessness, to be sure, was the factor 
least evaluated, but by now this was the prime scientific variable that Project 
Mercury was designed to answer. The psychological outlook was good anyway, 
argued STG rhetorically, for does not everyone who has learned to swim enjoy the 
freedom and relatively "weightless" state when immersed in water? As to reentry, 
the strain of positive and negative acceleration forces had almost certainly 
been conquered; only a few questions remained unanswered about actual reentry 
and recovery stresses. Indeed, what Headquarters had left unnumbered in its 
presentation and therefore seemed to have regarded almost as an afterthought, 
the Task Group considered the paramount problem: the reliability of the rocket 
boosters must be increased before manned capsules could be attached to them.
<P>The first major proof test of a critical part of the Mercury spacecraft 
design occurred on April 12, 1959. After a dismal failure a month before, the 
escape–tower rocket attached to a full-scale boilerplate model demonstrated its 
ability to lift both man and capsule away from a dangerous booster still on the 
ground. Giving first priority to providing an escape system in case of failure 
at launch was evidence of a pervading lack of confidence in the reliability of 
the big rockets. The men of the Space Task Group were not liquid-fuel propulsion 
experts; they had to rely on missile technicians and managers to convert weapon 
systems into launch vehicles for spacecraft. Since no one was expert in 
spacecraft engineering, STG had to rely on itself and on McDonnell Aircraft 
Corporation to gain as much experience as rapidly as possible with the capsule 
and its systems. This high adventure of learning how, specifically, to orbit a 
man safely was shared by a growing number of people supporting Project Mercury.

<P><A name=source1><SUP>1</A> </SUP>In considering how both technology and 
techniques began to evolve through the planning and tooling stages and into 
manufacturing and production, this chapter and the next make the conventional 
yet conceptually useful distinction between mechanical and human (factors) 
engineering endeavors. Another important distinction, that which rated pilot 
safety first and mission success second, was implicit from the start, but became 
explicit in the production programs only after many technical arguments and much 
rethinking. The process of man-rating the machines is meant to suggest all the 
efforts made to perfect a completely automatic system for Earth-orbital flight. 
The reciprocal process of machine rating men is meant to focus on the 
ambiguities in the idea of perfecting a completely automated system for such 
purposes. Chronologically this division coincides with the major, but by no 
means singular, concern of those responsible for the execution of Project 
Mercury during the year of development between the summers of 1959 and 1960.
