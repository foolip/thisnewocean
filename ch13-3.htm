<H1>Buildup for the Space Offensive</H1>Again NASA invited the world's news 
media to send representatives to cover one of its launches. On December 5, 1961, 
Headquarters informed newspaper and magazine editors that NASA was planning to 
accommodate up to 400 accredited reporters. No exact flight date was mentioned, 
but the press was told that the launch would occur "either late this year or 
early the next."<A

All hopes for a 1961 shot were dashed two days later when NASA Headquarters 
announced the postponement of MA-6 until early 1962.
<P>Work to assist the news media in covering the event had been proceeding at 
the Manned Spacecraft Center for some time. Several months before the MA-6 
launch, its Public Affairs Office, then under the direction of Lieutenant 
Colonel John A. "Shorty" Powers, began preparing a "Public Information Operating 
Plan," giving the estimated dates on which particular phases of the mission plan 
would be carried out. Powers evaluated each segment of the plan and recommended 
to the press various training and hardware preparation activities that the 
reporters might be interested in covering, as well as arranging for the 
reporters to cover flight-day activities. News release handouts were prepared 
covering almost every conceivable phase of the flight, from what the pilot would 
have for breakfast to an intricate discussion of how a spacecraft attitude 
control system should work. [420] About five days before the anticipated launch 
date, Powers and his troupe established a news center at Cocoa Beach, Florida. 
Some of his men were assigned to pass out fact sheets, some were to record 
pictorial events surrounding the flight for use by the news media, some were to 
seek answers to the myriad technical queries posed by newsmen, and some were 
assigned to prepare advisories concerning mission progress status.
<P>Correspondents accredited by NASA, many clad in colorful beach raiment, 
descended on the area. They avidly consumed the space agency's prepared 
information, interviewed key figures of the NASA-DOD-industry operations team, 
sunned on the beach, and pressed for more news and anecdotes after the evening 
meal. Some critics likened the atmosphere to that of a circus, but literally 
hundreds of thousands of words about every conceivable phase of the manned space 
program poured out for the edification of the tax-paying masses.<A

Surely in history no program that still essentially was in its research and 
development stage had ever been so open to the public through the eyes of the 
Fourth Estate.
<P>The first "gathering on the beach" to view the MA-6 launch occurred on a 
cloudy Saturday morning, January 27, 1962, after bad weather had forced the 
launch to slip day-to-day from January 23, when the firing was first intended. 
The countdown ticked on but the overcast remained solid, and a general feeling 
swept through the crowd of faithful "bird watchers" that this still was not the 
day. Finally, at T minus 20 minutes Walter C. Williams, the mission director, 
canceled the shot. The overcast was so heavy that the necessary camera coverage 
of the early trajectory events would be impossible. "It was one of those days," 
said Williams later, "when nothing was wrong but nothing was just right either. 
I welcomed that overcast."<A

John Glenn had been in his spacecraft, <I>Friendship 7</I>, named in a contest 
by his own family, a little over five hours. The rescheduling of the launch for 
February 1, four days ahead, necessitated emptying and purging the Atlas of its 
propellants.
<P>On January 30 the ground support crew once more began fueling Atlas 109-D. 
During preflight checkout, a mechanic discovered, by a routine opening of a 
drain plug, that there was fuel in the cavity between the structural bulkhead 
and an insulation bulkhead separating the fuel and oxidizer tanks. The launch 
vehicle team estimated that, since the insulation had to be removed, a maximum 
of 10 work days would be needed to correct the problem and to check out the 
systems. This delay would slip the launch date, and slipping the launch date 
caused problems for the recovery force. Some 24 ships, more than 60 aircraft, 
and a number of specialized units, manned by a combined total of 18,000 
personnel around the world, had to consider whether they could remain at their 
stations for a new date that might very well slip again. When all the tallies 
from the widespread units were before the recovery force commander, Rear Admiral 
John L. Chew, February 13 seemed the earliest possible next try at MA-6.<A

<P>On January 31, amidst an audible groan from more than 600 news-media [421] 
representatives who had managed to become accredited, the new launch date two 
weeks ahead was announced. Two weeks more at the Cape was too much for most of 
the benumbed newsmen; the exodus from the Florida peninsula began immediately. 
Only the spacecraft and launch vehicle technicians were left to minister, as 
Walter Williams termed it, to the "sick bird." Glenn took several days off to 
spend some time with his family at home in Arlington, Virginia. On one occasion 
he crossed the Potomac River to the White House for a brief visit with President 
Kennedy, who asked him many semitechnical questions about plans and systems for 
the orbital flight.<A

<P>On February 9, as NASA personnel began to move back to the Cape, the weather 
was still foul. Evidently the newsmen felt there was little chance for a 
launching on the scheduled date; by the 13th only 200 had checked in at the 
motels in nearby Cocoa Beach. They received some grist for the journalistic mill 
at a press briefing arranged by NASA's Paul P. Haney and "Shorty" Powers. Robert 
L. Foster from McDonnell answered some questions about the spacecraft and Major 
Charles L. Gandy and Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth E. Grine of the Air Force 
answered others on the launch vehicle work and the general state of readiness 
for the flight.<A

<P>[422] The turbulent February weather in Florida improved little in succeeding 
days, and the space pilot continued to train. On the 15th, for example, Glenn, 
learning upon awakening that the weather still held up the launch, slept until 
9:30 a.m:, had breakfast, spent two hours on the procedures trainer, and that 
afternoon studied the flight plan and technical documentation.
<P>On February 19 the sky brightened; so did the spirits of the operations crew, 
who immediately began the 610-minute split countdown. During the afternoon the 
Department of Defense recovery force weather observers in the Atlantic reported 
to Williams that they had favorable weather conditions. At the Cape, however, 
the Weather Bureau personnel observed a frontal system moving across central 
Florida which, they surmised, could cause broken cloudiness over the Cape area 
on Tuesday morning (February 20). Williams, hoping for the best, decided to 
continue and ordered the launch crew to pick up the second half of the countdown 
at 11:30 p.m. on the evening of the 19th.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-3.htm#source25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile Glenn restudied the detailed mission sequence, first reviewing the 
countdown progress and then looking over his flight plan and checking the 
equipment list. That afternoon he attended another "final" mission review 
meeting, called by Williams. Glenn believed an astronaut should study his 
spacecraft's systems until the last possible minute before a flight. Shortly 
before he went to bed that night he read a section in the flight controller's 
handbook on the automatic stabilization and control system.<A

an interview, John A. "Shorty" Powers on Nov. 12, 1965, said that in his opinion 
the delays preceding the Glenn flight produced some helpful effects in the way 
of news reporting. Stories about the "type" of hats that Annie [Glenn's wife] 
was wearing began to play out. The reporters were forced to become more 
technically conversant if they were to file stories that would keep their 
editors happy as well as justify the Florida expense accounts.
