Specifications for a Manned Satellite<BR><BR>
<SPAN>(October&ndash;December 1958)</SPAN></H2>
<P>[109] "All right. Let's get on with it!"
<P>These were the informal words of leadership that launched the development of
the United States' first manned space flight program. They were spoken by T.
Keith Glennan, newly appointed first Administrator of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, following a briefing by eight civil service
aeronautical engineers who felt ready to become "astronautical engineers." This
was exactly a year and three days after national debate and preliminary planning
had been precipitated by <I>Sputnik I</I>. Glennan's words symbolized the firm
resolution of the Congress, the Eisenhower administration, and the American
people to accept the challenge of nature, technology, and the Soviet Union to
explore the shallows of the universe.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>By the first anniversary of Earth's first artificial satellite, Americans
generally seemed willing, if not eager, to accept the rationale of scientific
experts and engineering enthusiasts that the new ocean of space could now and
should now be explored by man in person. The human and the physical energies
necessary for man to venture beyond Earth's atmosphere had become, for the first
time in the history of this planet, available in feasible form. These energies
only needed transformation by organization and development to transport man into
the beyond.
<P>If these were the articles of faith behind the first American manned
satellite program, they had not been compelling enough to spark action toward
space flight before the Sputniks. Public furor was inspired primarily not by the
promise of extending aeronautics and missilery into astronautics, but rather by
the nationalistic fervor and punctured pride caused by the obviously spectacular
Soviet achievements. Faith, fervor, and even some fear were perhaps necessary if
the [110] American democracy was to embark on a significant space program. But
the people most directly concerned with mobilizing the men and the technology to
accomplish manned orbital flight had first to organize themselves.

<H3>A Manned Satellite Plan</H3>The establishment of an organization to carry
through a manned space flight program depended upon gaining the national
decision to create a space agency and then upon defining the objectives of the
space agency as a whole and of its highest priority programs in particular. In
July 1958 legislative debate had ended in the passage of the National
Aeronautics and Space Act. In August administrative power struggles had abated
with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's appointments and Senate confirmation of
the administrative heads of the new space agency. By September the technical and
jurisdictional questions remaining to be solved for an operational manned
satellite program had been removed from the open forum by their assignment to
the Joint NASA-ARPA Manned Satellite Panel. When Glennan proclaimed that the
demise of NACA and the birth of NASA would take effect at the close of business
on September 30, 1958, there was reason to suppose that a preliminary
organization of the nation's space program was well in hand. But in Washington
there was no clear commitment to the precise size or priority of the manned
program within NASA, because NASA itself was as yet only a congeries of
transferred people, facilities, and projects.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<P>Earlier attempts to coordinate interservice and interagency plans and
procedures for putting a man in space had been ineffectual. During the middle of
September, Glennan and Roy W. Johnson, Director of Advanced Research Projects
Agency (ARPA), had come to agree on the bare outline of a joint program for a
manned orbital vehicle based on the ballistic capsule idea. A month earlier,
Hugh L. Dryden, the veteran Director of the NACA, and Robert R. Gilruth,
Assistant Director of Langley Aeronautical Research Laboratory, had informed
Congressional committees of their plans for a manned capsule and had requested
$30 million to proceed with the work. But only when the Joint Manned Satellite
Panel was established by executive agreement between NASA and ARPA in
mid-September 1958 did plans and proposals begin to jell into a positive course
of action.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>Of the eight members of this steering committee, only two were from ARPA. Six
had come from NACA and were the principal policy makers who laid down the
guidelines and objectives for the first manned space flight program. This group
began to meet almost continuously in late September in an effort to establish
preliminary plans and schedules for the manned satellite project. Thousands of
scientists and engineers over past years made possible their outline report,
entitled "Objectives and Basic Plan for the Manned Satellite Project." But
technical liaison between military and civilian groups on the immediate working
levels provided the specific data for the outline drawn up by this panel:
[111]<A
href="notes.htm#n5.4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE class="outline"><OL>
  <LI>OBJECTIVES
  <P>The objectives of the project are to achieve at the earliest practicable
  date orbital flight and successful recovery of a manned satellite, and to
  investigate the capabilities of man in this environment.
  <LI>MISSION
  <P>To accomplish these objectives, the most reliable available boost system
  will be used. A nearly circular orbit will be established at an altitude
  sufficiently high to permit a 24-hour satellite lifetime; however, the number
  of orbital cycles is arbitrary. Descent from orbit will be initiated by the
  application of retro-thrust. Parachutes will be deployed after the vehicle has
  been slowed down by aerodynamic drag, and recovery on land or water will be
  possible.
  <LI>CONFIGURATION
  <P>A. <I>Vehicle</I>
  <P>The vehicle will be a ballistic capsule with high aerodynamic drag. It
  should be statically stable over the mach number range corresponding to
  flight within the atmosphere. Structurally, the capsule will be designed to
  withstand any combination of acceleration, heat loads, and aerodynamic
  forces that might occur during boost and reentry of successful or aborted
  missions.
</OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class="noindent">The document outlined generally the life support,
attitude control, retrograde, recovery, and emergency systems and described the
guidance and tracking, instrumentation, communications, ground support, and test
program requirements.
<P>In only two and one-half pages of typescript, the "Objectives and Basic Plan"
for the manned satellite were laid out for the concurrence of the Director of
ARPA and the Administrator of NASA during the first week of October 1958. Verbal
elucidations of accompanying charts, tables, and diagrams, plus scale models
brought along from Langley Field, successfully sold this approach for putting
man into orbit. Although the Air Force, Army, and Navy, as well as numerous
aviation industry research teams, also had plans that might have worked equally
well, the Nation could afford only one such program. The simplest, quickest,
least risky, and most promising plan seemed to be this one.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
<P>The fact that the Joint Manned Satellite Panel was "loaded" six to two in
favor of NASA reflected the White House decision that ARPA would assist NASA
rather than comanage the project. The plans of the panel gave the appearance of
unanimity among aeronautical engineers on how to accomplish manned orbital
flight. Keith Glennan and Roy Johnson were impressed by this consensus but they
refrained from making public their commitments for several more months. The
tacit agreement among the panel members that no basic technical or scientific
problems remained to be solved before moving into development and flight test
would be tested by industrial response to the basic plan. If previous research
had been sufficiently thorough to allow NASA to begin immediately applying
engineering knowledge for the achievement of orbital flight, then the panel's
judgment of [112] the state of the art should be confirmed by the aircraft
companies. Only Alfred J. Eggers wished to be placed on record as favoring
concurrent development of a lifting reentry vehicle.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
<P>The panel recommended three types of flight testing programs. First,
development tests should verify the components of the manned satellite vehicle
"to the point where they consistently and reliably perform satisfactorily, and
provide design criteria by measuring loads, heating, and aerodynamic stability
derivatives during critical portions of the flight." Second, qualification
flight tests should determine suitability of the complete vehicle to perform its
specified missions. Third, training and pilot performance flight tests should
validate man's "potential for the specified missions."
<BLOCKQUOTE><P class="noindent">
  In this program, all three types of tests will be made with
  full-scale articles. These tests will be initiated at low velocities,
  altitudes and loads. They will progress with a buildup in severity of these
  conditions until the maximum mission is reached. In general, development tests
  will be completed, followed by qualification tests, and pilot performance and
  training tests. However, there will be some overlap as the severity of
  conditions are built up in the flight test program. The number and type of
  pilot performance and training flights will be determined as the program
  develops.<A
  href="notes.htm#n5.7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Although
the conceptual design and the operating philosophy for the manned satellite
program were remarkably firm at the time of authorization, specific technical
difficulties in development could not be pinpointed in advance. The people who
would have to solve them were only then being identified and appointed to their
individual jobs. At NACA Headquarters in Washington, Hugh Dryden had presided
during the summer over the metamorphosis of NACA into NASA. An established
scientist and a proven technical executive, Dryden had been a logical choice if
not for the Administrator, then for Deputy Administrator, the second highest
position within the space agency. He must decide how many and who should move to
Washington to manage the administrative side and to oversee the engineering
work. What proportion of effort and funds should NASA spend on developing
manned, as opposed to unmanned, spacecraft and rockets? On whom should the
immediate responsibility for technical direction of the manned satellite program
be put? Where should the locus for ground control of manned space flight
operations be placed?

<H3>The People in Charge</H3>Glennan and Dryden decided many questions of
appointment quite naturally by allowing informal working arrangements to become
formal. Glennan's fellow Clevelander, Abe Silverstein, Associate Director of
NACA's Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, was appointed Director of Space
Flight Development. Silverstein had been the technical director of research at
Lewis since 1949 and had worked closely with Dryden since March and with Glennan
since August in [113] planning the early organization of NASA.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
As reflected by his title, manned programs per se were supposed to occupy only
about one-third of Silverstein's time. He brought with him from Cleveland three
other scientist-administrators of demonstrated talents to handle most of his
staff work concerning the manned satellite program, which then was a minor
portion of Silverstein's responsibility compared with his concerns over
propulsion development. Newell D. Sanders became Silverstein's Assistant
Director for Advanced Technology. But the primary relations between Washington
and the field activities for manned space flight development were to be handled
by George M. Low, who eventually became chief of an Office of Manned Space
Flight, and Warren J. North, a former NACA test pilot who at first headed an
Office of Manned Satellites, then of Space Flight Programs. Dryden and Glennan
depended heavily upon Silverstein and his aides for the technical review and
supervision of the division of labor among the various NASA field centers. But
the locus of manned space flight preparations remained with the small group of
Langley and Lewis personnel under Gilruth, the group that had zealously
researched, planned, and designed what was to become Project Mercury.
<P>Dryden desired to conserve the character of the three primary NACA centers as
national laboratories specializing as necessary in applied and advanced research
for aeronautics and astronautics. Glennan agreed to assign the large new
development and operational programs to distinct, or at least reorganized,
groups of people. The directors of the Langley, Ames, and Lewis Research Centers
should continue their aeronautical and missile work with a minimum of
disturbance while expanding the proportion of their research devoted to space.
NASA Headquarters personnel, temporarily located in the Dolley Madison House,
across Lafayette Square from the White House, should be able to coordinate
agency-wide activities without too much interference in the high degree of local
autonomy at the research laboratories near airfields in Virginia, California,
and Ohio.
<P>With the birth of NASA all the former NACA laboratories had their names
changed. Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, from 1920 until 1940 the
first and only research lab for NACA, became on October 1, 1958, the Langley
Research Center. Located on the Virginia peninsula, across Hampton Roads from
Norfolk, the Langley laboratories flanked one side of old Langley Field, one of
the pioneer U.S. military airfields; for 10 years now the Air Force had called
it the Langley Air Force Base. NASA's 700 acres there contained buildings and
hangars more permanent and other structures more unusual than were normally
found at military airfields. On opposite edges of the runways, about 3000
civilians in 1958 worked at facilities worth more than $150 million. About 700
of these people were professional engineers and self-made scientists whose major
tools were 30 different wind tunnels. Also they had experimental models,
operating aircraft, shops, and laboratories for chemistry, physics, electronics,
and hydrodynamics.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>As a national aeronautical laboratory Langley supported little if any "pure"
[114] or "basic" science, in the sense of independent individual investigations
in pursuit of knowledge as opposed to utility. But it had long provided a
world-renowned institutional setting for "applied science." Both research and
development were carried on there without prejudice.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
<P>Now that the "sky" was to be redefined in terms of "aerospace," man's mastery
of dimensions at least five times higher than he had ever flown required
radically new social as well as technological inventions. Silverstein was asked
by Dryden to help Gilruth create an entirely new management organization,
composed primarily of Langley personnel, without disrupting other work in
progress. The Director of Langley Research Center, Henry J. E. Reid, was on the
verge of retirement, and responsibility for administering Langley had devolved
to Floyd L. Thompson. Neither Reid nor Thompson was close enough to the manned
satellite working level, where events were moving so rapidly, to assume charge
of the special organization taking shape there.
<P>The project director of the manned satellite program should therefore be the
man who had already directed it through its gestation period - Robert R.
Gilruth. As Assistant Director of Langley and the former chief of the Pilotless
Aircraft Research Division (PARD), he had long nurtured Maxime A. Faget and his
associates, the conceptual designers of the NACA manned satellite. After the
consolidation of professional consensus at Langley behind the Faget plan in
March 1958, Dryden and his Washington associates Ira H. Abbott and John W.
Crowley, Jr., had given Gilruth authority to get underway.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>Gilruth had come to Langley after earning his master's degree in aeronautical
engineering at the University of Minnesota under Professor Jean Piccard in 1936.
He had been a leader in research during the development of transonic and
supersonic aircraft, becoming the man in charge of structures, dynamic loads,
and pilotless aircraft studies at Langely in 1952. During the decade of guided
missile development, Gilruth had served on some six scientific advisory
committees for the military services and for NACA. His eminence was widely
recognized both as a scientist-engineer and as a research administrator.
Furthermore, he was eager to continue his leadership of the vigorous group of
younger engineers working with Faget.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>As soon as Gilruth and Faget returned with Glennan's verbal approval "to
implement the manned satellite project," Thompson, acting director of Langley,
began making arrangements to establish in separate facilities at the Unitary
Wind Tunnel Building the self-appointed group already working on space flight.
Charles J. Donlan, Technical Assistant to the Director of Langley, was asked to
serve as Assistant Project Manager. Under Gilruth and Donlan, 33 Langley
personnel, 25 of these engineers (14 of them from PARD), were officially
transferred on November 5, 1958, to form the nucleus of a separate organization
to be called the Space Task Group.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>Although the new Task Group was responsible directly to Washington, its
initial composition and actions were left largely to local initiative. The
Langley [115] group had anticipated by two months the official actions and had
discussed organization of a "Manned Ballistic Satellite Task Group." Called by
some of its secretaries the "Space Task Force," it had acquired 10 to 15 men
from Lewis Research Center when Silverstein in July had directed them to commute
to Langley to aid in working out detailed designs for structure, thermal
protection, and instrumentation in the program. This informal Langley-Lewis
working arrangement gradually integrated and expanded as the Space Task Group
took shape through the following year.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>Gilruth's authorization gave him two hats: one as project manager of the
Space Task Group, and the other - announced May 1, 1959 - as assistant director
of a new NASA "space projects center" to be located near Greenbelt, Maryland,
about 15 miles northeast of the Nation's capital. In Washington, Dryden and
Silverstein were making plans for this space development facility to accommodate
the NASA inheritance of Project Vanguard and about 150 of its personnel,
transferred from the Naval Research Laboratory. Such a facility might easily
double as an operations control center. At this time the scientific and
operational aspects of manned satellites appeared to complement the tracking
network and instrumentation for the Vanguard satellites. So as soon as the
building could be constructed on an agricultural experimental farm at
Beltsville, Maryland, the Space Task Group would move there. In the interim
Langley would continue to furnish lodging and logistic support while a space
flight operations center was being built. All this was to change about two years
later when it became apparent that the scope, size, and support for manned space
endeavors called for an entirely separate center.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>Everyone connected with the Space Task Group in the first several months of
its existence was too busy preparing and mailing specifications, briefing
prospective contractors, and evaluating contractor proposals to take much
interest in organization charts. A kind of executive committee, forming around
Gilruth and Donlan during November and December, gradually organized itself
along functional lines. Gilruth and Donlan, Faget and Paul E. Purser, Charles W.
Mathews, and Charles H. Zimmerman formed the core of this first executive
council. Other senior NACA engineers on the original STG personnel list, men
like Aleck C. Bond, Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., Howard C. Kyle, George F.
MacDougall, Jr., and Harry H. Ricker, Jr., also played important roles in the
initial formulation of the technological plan of attack.
<P>Of the 35 members of the original group from Langley, only eight provided
administrative or clerical services. Thus, with the 10 additional people from
the Lewis laboratory, Gilruth and Donlan had 35 scientist-engineers to assign to
specific technical problems. Those 14 who came directly from PARD continued
working on implementing their designs, as they had been doing for almost a year.
Five men came from the Flight Research Division of Langley, two came from the
Instrument Research Division, two from the Stability Research Division, and one
each from the Dynamic Loads and Full-Scale Tunnel Research Divisions. [116] Some
of these, men like William M. Bland, Jr., John P. Mayer, Robert G. Chilton,
Jerome B. Hammack, Jack C. Heberlig, William T. Lauten, Jr., and Alan B. Kehlet,
had made substantial professional investments in the space flight program at a
time when this was still some risk to their careers. Being a Buck Rogers buff
was not yet quite respectable.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
<P>From Glennan's approval of the project until the formal establishment of the
Space Task Group on November 5, and indeed for some months later, it was by no
means certain how much support and what priority the manned satellite program
might receive. Some NACA careerists were hesitant to join an operation that
might easily prove abortive. So far Gilruth had no specified billets to fill nor
any public, formal mandate from Headquarters. He and Silverstein worked together
very closely through the shuttle service of George Low on Silverstein's staff,
who divided his time between Washington and STG. The hectic early days,
cluttered and confused, made the future of the Task Group appear less than
certain. Although NASA Headquarters had received from ARPA and allocated to
Langley the necessary funds to get started, NASA seemed to prefer the science
programs it had inherited along with instrumented satellites. The Space Task
Group wanted full and explicit support of the development engineering necessary
for a manned satellite. But the members did not let lack of documented clarity
from the policy level dampen their enthusiasm or activity. Throughout October,
trips and conferences by key personnel verified at the working level and in the
field what could and could not be done to implement policy planning in
Washington. To many of the younger engineers under Gilruth, NASA's initial
organizational confusion offered opportunity for initiative at the local level
to accomplish more than directives from Headquarters in getting an American into
orbit.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>In order to avoid the danger of converting the Langley Research Center into
Langley "Research and Development" Center, Dryden insisted that the Space Task
group should be separated from the mother institution and attached to the
Beltsville Center. Some Langley engineers welcomed the opportunity to
participate in a full-fledged development program; others, more
research-oriented, abhorred the idea. In managing the Space Task Group, Gilruth
had to reconcile these attitudes, to recruit talent and screen zeal, and to
create an organization capable of developing into hardware what had been
conceived in research.

<H3>"Aerospace" Technology</H3>One of the scientific questions of the
International Geophysical Year that had to be answered before the orbital
mechanics of a manned satellite could be specified in detail was: where
precisely does Earth's atmosphere end? By late 1958 the aeromedical fraternity,
following Hubertus Strughold's lead, had accepted the conceptual outlines of
"space-equivalent altitudes," with refined definitions of the "aeropause," as a
general biological guide to answer a slightly different question: [117] where
does space begin? But upper-atmospheric studies, based on the actual behavior of
the six or eight known artificial satellites plus the data gained from a few
rocket probes and about 100 comparable sounding rockets and balloons, were
neither definite enough nor codified well enough to plan the precise height at
which man should first orbit Earth.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>The NASA/ARPA mission specification of a circular orbit to be achieved by
"the most reliable available boost system . . . at an altitude sufficiently high
to permit a 24-hour satellite lifetime" (before the natural decay, or
degradation, of the original orbit because of slight but effective
upper-atmospheric friction) had carefully avoided a commitment to either a
booster or an orbital altitude. The Space Task Group proceeded on the assumption
that both apogee and perigee of the manned ballistic satellite should be within
the rough limits of 100&plusmn;25 miles high. The Task Group chose 100 statute miles
(87 nautical miles) as the nominal average altitude to ensure a full-Earth-day
lifetime for the one-ton manned moonlet.
<P>The outer limits of Earth's atmosphere, where it blends in equilibrium with
the solar atmosphere or plasma, seemed around 2000 miles, and the "edge" of the
outer ionospheric shell was thought to be perhaps 4000 miles above sea level,
but these were irrelevant parameters for orbit selections. ICBM performance data
at that time made it certain that the "most reliable available boost system"
could not boost a 2200-pound ballistic capsule even to the 400-or-so-mile
"floor" of the Van Allen belt.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>The Atlas ICBM was still "the most reliable available boost system"; there
was as yet no viable alternative booster. All preliminary hardware planning had
been based on the assumption that the Atlas would prove its power and prowess
very soon. The NACA nucleus of NASA was composed for the most part of
aeronautical engineers, airplane men not yet expert with missiles and rockets.
Few of them at first fully realized how different were the flight regimes and
requirements for the technology of flight without wings.
<P>Since World War II winged guided missiles or pilotless drone airplanes had
given way to rocket-propelled ballistic projectiles; by 1958 the industrial base
and engineering competence for missilery had matured separately from and
tangentially to the aviation industry.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
If the manned satellite program were to become the first step for sustained
manned space flight, a new synthesis between science and engineering and a new
integration between the aircraft and missile industries would be necessary.
"Space science" and "aerospace technology," terms already made popular by the
Air Force, were now in the public domain, but their meanings were vague and
ambiguous so long as they held so little operational content. Silverstein,
Crowley, and Albert F. Siepert, the men who became the first executive directors
of the top three "line offices" of NASA Headquarters, indubitably had their
debates on programming operations for NASA and the Nation. But on the need for
new syntheses and reintegrations of established disciplines and industries there
could be no debate. NASA's legal mandate to coordinate and to contract [118] for
cooperative development "of the usefulness, performance, speed, safety, and
efficiency of aeronautical and space vehicles" was second only to its first
objective in the Space Act, expanding "human knowledge of phenomena in the
atmosphere and space."<A
href="notes.htm#n5.21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>The complex prehistory of NASA and the manned satellite program began to
impinge on NASA policy. It affected project planners as soon as they set forth
their intention to put a man into orbit. Industrial and military investments in
feasibility studies to this same goal had been heavy. The Space Task Group
decided in mid-October to withdraw from all contacts with industrial contractors
while finishing its preliminary specifications for the manned satellite capsule.
STG thus avoided any accusations of favoritism, but lost about two months in
time before it was able to acquire the latest classified and proprietary studies
and designs by other organizations.
<P>Three most pertinent examples of industrial research going on concurrently
with government research and leading up to seminal proposals for manned
satellite specifications were those studies being conducted by the
Convair/Astronautics Division (CV/A) of the General Dynamics Corporation in
conjunction with the Avco Manufacturing Corporation, studies by the General
Electric Company in conjunction with North American Aviation, Inc., and those by
McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. The CV/A-Avco proposal to the Air Force in April
1958 for a spherical drag-braked manned satellite was followed by more reports
by CV/A in June and November, and these proved that the builders of the Atlas
were exploring every avenue for civilian uses of their booster rocket. Convair
men like Karel J. Bossart, Mortimer Rosenbaum, Charles S. Ames, Frank J. Dore,
Hans R. Friedrich, Byron G. MacNabb, F. A. Ford, Krafft A. Ehricke, and H. B.
Steele had a continuing interest in seeing their fledgling weapons carrier
converted into a launch vehicle for manned space flight, either with or without
an upper stage.
<P>At NASA Headquarters, Abe Silverstein decided early in November to formalize
his earlier approval of Faget's plan for the "bare Atlas." On that basis a
formal bidders' briefing for the capsule contract was planned for November 7.
Only after mid-December, when all the proposals were in, did STG learn how great
had been other industrial investments in research for a manned ballistic
satellite.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>Although the Atlas airframe, design, and systems integration had all grown
directly out of Convair engineering development, the liquid-fueled rocket
engines for the Atlas, as well as for the Redstone, Jupiter, and Thor missiles,
were all products of the Rocketdyne Division of North American Aviation, Inc.
Hence North American, when teamed with another corporate giant, General
Electric, appeared also to be a prime contender for the manned satellite
contract. The Space Task Group was only dimly aware at this time of the
specifications that had emerged from North American and General Electric as
proposals for the Air Force's "Man-in-Space-Soonest" studies, but it did know at
least that its own ballistic capsule plan was at variance with the "high lift
over drag" thinking at North American.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
<P>[119] Back in May 1957, five months before <I>Sputnik I</I>, James S.
McDonnell, Jr., the founder and president of a growing aircraft corporation
bearing his name, gave an address at an engineering school commencement
ceremony. He predicted a speculative timetable for astronautics that placed the
achievement of the first manned Earth satellite, weighing four tons and costing
one billion dollars, between the years 1990 and 2005 A.D. One year later, in a
similar address, McDonnell sagaciously abandoned his timetable and said:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P class="noindent">
  I think it is fortunate that the Soviets have boldly challenged us
  in [space science and exploration] . . . . Their space challenge is a fair
  challenge. We should accept this challenge and help to turn it primarily into
  peaceful channels.
  <P class="stars">&lowast; &lowast; &lowast;</P>
  <P class="noindent">
  So, fellow pilgrims, welcome to the wondrous age of astronautics. May
  serendipity be yours in the years to come as man stands on the earth as a
  footstool and reaches out to the moon, the planets, and the stars.<A
  href="notes.htm#n5.24"><SUP>24</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Off
and on since <I>Sputnik II</I>, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation's Advanced
Planning Group had assigned first 20, then 40, and, from April through June
1958, some 70 men to work on preliminary designs for a manned satellite capsule.
Led by Raymond A. Pepping, Lawrence M. Weeks, John F. Yardley, and Albert Utsch,
these men had completed a thoroughgoing prospectus 427 pages in length by
mid-October 1958. People at Langley had been aware of this work in some detail,
but when NACA and PARD became part of NASA, a curtain of discretion fell between
them and STG. The McDonnell proposal was repolished during November before it
took its turn and its chances with all the rest of the bidders.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
<P>While interested aerospace companies were endeavoring to fulfill the
Government's plans and specifications for a manned satellite, a number of men in
the institutional setting at Langley were busily engaged in final preparations
for the bidders' conference. Craftsmen like Z. B. Truitt and Scott Curran, in
the Langley shops, fabricated new models of both the couch and the capsule for
demonstration purposes. Engineering designers like Caldwell C. Johnson and
Russell E. Clickner, Jr., reworked multiple sets of mechanical drawings until
Faget and the Task Group were satisfied that they had the architectonic
engineering briefing materials ready for their prospective spacecraft
manufacturing contractors. Gilruth, Donlan, Mathews, and Zimmerman meanwhile
approved the block diagrams of systems as they evolved. They looked over their
requirements for outside support in future launching operations, flight
operations, trouble-shooting research, and crew selection and training. With
everything going on at once among half a hundred men at most, there was no time
now in STG for second thoughts or doubts about whether the "Faget concept" would
work.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
<P>Questions of policy and personnel at the time of the organization of NASA and
during the birth of this nation's manned space flight program were affected
significantly by a conflict then existing between the experts on men and the
experts on missiles. In the eyes of the Space Task Group, the medical
fraternity, particularly some Air Force physicians, was exceedingly cautious,
whereas the Space Task Group [120] seemed overly confident to some Air Force
medical men and some of their pilots. During the deliberations of the joint
NASA-ARPA Manned Satellite Panel, the contrast between the technical aspects of
the Air Force's "Man-in-Space-Soonest" proposal and the Faget plan sponsored by
the Langley-PARD group had been resolved in favor of the latter. Air Force
planners of the Air Research and Development Command early had accepted a basic
ground rule specifying 12 g as the design limit for capsule reentry loads. They
had opposed the so-called "bare Atlas" approach, which would carry the risk of
imposing accelerations up to 20 g in case of a mid-launch abort. As a last
resort they too had turned to the standard Atlas as the most feasible launch
vehicle, even though, Faget believed, Air Force aeromedical experts had not
accepted the significance of the physiological demonstrations by Carter C.
Collins and R. Flanagan Gray on the Navy's centrifuge at Johnsville in July that
man could sustain 20 g without lasting harmful effects. In calculating the risks
in manned space flight, the group at Langley saw this event as having paramount
importance.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
<P>To ensure that NASA would have intelligent liaison and some expertise of its
own in dealing with military aeromedical organizations, one of the early
official actions of the NASA Administrator was the appointment on November 21 of
a Special Committee on Life Sciences, headed by W. Randolph Lovelace II. This
committee, composed of members from the Air Force, Army, Navy, Atomic Energy
Commission, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and private life,
should provide "objective" advice on the role of the human pilot and all
considerations involving him. However, NASA and particularly STG would soon
discover certain difficulties with this, as with other, review committees
"having a certain amount of authority . . . yet no real responsibility" for
seeing that the program worked properly.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>On a similar but lower plane, Gilruth asked for and received from the
military services three professional consultants for an aeromedical staff.
Lieutenant Colonel Stanley C. White from the Air Force and Captain William S.
Augerson from the Army were physicians with considerable experience in aerospace
medicine, and Lieutenant Robert B. Voas from the Navy held a Ph. D. in
psychology. Thus both NASA and STG ensured the autonomy of their medical advice
while at the same time they tapped, through White, the biomedical knowledge
gained by the Air Force in its "Man-in-Space-Soonest" studies and, through
Augerson, that gained by the Army and Navy through joint biosatellite
planning.<A

<H3>Calling for a Capsule Contractor</H3>The Space Task Group was ready by
October 20, 1958, to initiate the formal quest for the best builder of a
spacecraft. Silverstein, Gilruth, Donlan, Faget, Mathews, and Zimmerman had
decided what they wanted; now the top-priority need was to decide which
contractor would be most competent to construct, [121] at maximum reliability
and speed and with minimum cost and risk, the first manned spacecraft.
<P>Preliminary specifications for capsule and subsystems were mailed by the
Langley procurement office to more than 40 prospective firms on October 23,
1958. Thirty-eight of these companies responded by sending representatives to
the bidders' conference at Langley Field on November 7. The briefing was
conducted by Faget, Alan Kehlet, Aleck Bond, Andre Meyer, Jack Heberlig, and
several others from STG and Langley. The verbal exchange of ideas at this
meeting was preliminary to corporate expressions of interest expected by STG
before mid-November. After that the Task Group would mail out formal
specifications as the basis for bid proposals to be submitted before December
11, 1958. After his part of the briefing, Faget was asked by one of the
representatives whether the retrorockets described could also be used for
escape. Faget said no and explained why not. He then made it clear that any
alternative capsule configurations would be considered "provided that you
incorporate the retrorocket principle, the non-lifting principle, and the
non-ablating heat sink principle."<A
href="notes.htm#n5.30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
<P>Nineteen of the companies present expressed interest in the competition; they
were mailed copies of STG's 50-page "Specifications for Manned Space Capsule" on
November 14, 1958. This document, officially numbered "S-6," formally described
STG's expectations of the missions, configurations, stabilization and control,
structural design, onboard equipment, instrumentation, and testing for manned
orbital flight, but significantly it did not deal in detail with reliability,
costs, or schedules for flight testing.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>By December 11, the deadline for bid proposals, the list of original
competitors had narrowed to 11; there was a late starter in Winzen Research,
Inc., whose proposal was incomplete. All but three of these manufacturers had
been engaged for at least a year with feasibility studies related to the Air
Force plans for a manned satellite. Of the 11, the eight corporations with
deepest investments were Avco, Convair/Astronautics, Lockheed, Martin,
McDonnell, North American, Northrop, and Republic. The three other bidders were
the Douglas, Grumman, and Chance-Vought aircraft companies. Significantly
perhaps, certain other major missile and aircraft companies, like Bell, Boeing,
and United Aircraft, were not represented. Bell was preoccupied with the
Dyna-Soar studies; Boeing also was working on Dyna-Soar and had obtained the
prime contract for the Minuteman missile system; and United Aircraft sent its
regrets to Reid that it was otherwise deeply committed.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
Other military research and development contracts, such as those for the XB-70
"Valkyrie" and XF-108 were also competing for the attention of the aerospace
industry.
<P>The Space Task Group and NASA Headquarters meanwhile had worked out the
procedures for technical assessment of these manufacturers' proposals and for
contractual evaluations and negotiations. At Langley, a Technical Assessment
Committee headed by Donlan was to appoint 11 component assessment teams to rate
the contending companies in each of 11 technical areas. The classification [122]
system set up by the Space Task Group to evaluate these competitors for the
spacecraft contract illustrated the major areas of concern.
<P>Between four and six research engineers sat on each of the following 11
components assessment teams: systems integration; load, structure, and
heatshield; escape system; retrograde and landing system; attitude control
systems; environmental systems; pilot support and restraint system; pilot
displays and navigational aids; communications systems; instrumentation sensors,
recorders, and telemeters; and power supplies. Each area was rated on a
five-point scale ranging from excellent to unsatisfactory; the scores from these
ratings were averaged to provide an overall technical order of preference.
<P>All this had to be done over the Christmas holidays and while the Task Group
was moving from the Unitary Wind Tunnel building on the west side of Langley Air
Force Base to new quarters in an old NACA building on the east side. Early in
January at NASA Headquarters a similar assessment team would gather to evaluate
the competitors on their competence in management and cost accountability.
MacDougall was to be the only Task Group representative on the "business
evaluation" committee. Finally, a Source Selection Board, chaired by Silverstein
at NASA Headquarters and including Zimmerman from STG, would review the grading,
approve it, and make its final recommendation for the choice of the spacecraft
contractor.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
<P>Although virtually everyone in the Task Group participated in the process of
selecting the capsule builder, there were other equally pressing tasks to be
accomplished as soon as possible. Procurement of booster rockets, the detailed
design and development of a smaller, cheaper test booster, and the problem of
finding the best volunteers to man the finished product - these were seen as the
major problems requiring a head start in the fall of 1958.

<H3>Shopping for the Boosters</H3>Booster procurement was perhaps the most
critical, if not the highest priority task to be initiated. Once the Hobson's
choice had been made to gear a manned satellite project to the unproven design
capabilities of the Atlas ICBM, the corollary decision to use the most reliable
of the older generation of ballistic missiles for testing purposes followed
ineluctably. While the intercontinental-range Atlas was still being
flight-tested, the medium-range Redstone was the only trustworthy booster rocket
in the American arsenal. For suborbital tests, the intermediate-range Jupiter
and Thor boosters were possible launch vehicles, but as yet they were neither
capable of achieving orbital velocities nor operationally reliable.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>Even while the Joint Manned Satellite Panel was briefing the administrators
of ARPA and NASA during the first week in October, Purser, Faget, North, and
Samuel Batdorf flew to Huntsville for a business conference with the Army
Ballistic Missile Agency regarding procurement of launch vehicles. Wernher von
Braun's people assured their NASA visitors that Redstone missiles could be made
available [123] on 12 to 14 months' notice and that the Army's Jupiters were far
superior to the Thors of the Air Force. Although the Space Task Group had
already consulted the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, at Inglewood,
California, and was considering the Thor for intermediate launchings, a careful
reconsideration of the adaptability of each weapon system as a launch vehicle
for a manned capsule was now evidently required. The so-called "old reliable"
Redstones might have been ordered right away. But the question of the need for
intermediate qualification and training flights along ballistic trajectories was
not yet settled.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
So more visitations to the Air Force and Army missile centers were arranged.
<P>STG's wager on the Atlas was formalized by an order to the Air Force, placed
on December 8, 1958, for first one, then nine of these Convair-made
liquid-fueled rockets. The Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, heretofore the
only customer for the Atlas, agreed to supply one Atlas, a C-model, within six
months and the rest, all standard D-models, as needed over a period of several
years. Faget was pleasantly surprised to know an Atlas-C could be furnished so
soon. Having placed its first and primary order with the Air Force, the Space
Task Group went on to decide a month later to buy eight Redstones and two
Jupiter boosters from the Army Ordnance Missile Command. The decision to procure
both medium- and intermediate-range boosters from the same source hinged largely
on the fact that the Jupiter was basically an advanced Redstone. Both were
Army-managed and developed and Chrysler-built. To adopt the Thor would have
required another orientation and familiarization program for NASA engineers.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>Informed that the Atlas prime movers would cost approximately $2.5 million
each and that even the Redstone would cost about $1 million per launching, the
managers of the manned satellite project recognized from the start that the
numerous early test flights would have to be accomplished by a far less
expensive booster system. In fact, as early as January 1958 Faget and Purser had
worked out in considerable detail on paper how to cluster four of the solid-fuel
Sergeant rockets, in standard use by PARD at Wallops Island, to boost a manned
nose cone above the stratosphere. Faget's short-lived "High Ride" proposal had
suffered from comparisons with "Project Adam" at that time, but in August 1958
William Bland and Ronald Kolenkiewicz had returned to their preliminary designs
for a cheap cluster of solid rockets to boost full-scale and full-weight model
capsules above the atmosphere. As drop tests of boilerplate capsules provided
new aerodynamic data on the dynamic stability of the configuration in free-fall,
the need for comparable data quickly on the powered phase became apparent. So in
October a team of Bland, Kolenkiewicz, Caldwell Johnson, Clarence T. Brown, and
F. E. Mershon prepared new engineering layouts and estimates for the mechanical
design of the booster structure and a suitable launcher.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
<P>As the blueprints for this cluster of four rockets began to emerge from their
drawing boards, the designers' nickname for their project gradually was adopted.
[124] Since their first cross-section drawings showed four holes up, they called
the project "Little Joe," from the crap-game throw of a double deuce on the
dice. Although four smaller circles were added later to represent the addition
of Recruit rocket motors, the original name stuck. The appearance on engineering
drawings of the four large stabilizing fins protruding from its airframe also
helped to perpetuate the name Little Joe had acquired.
<P>The primary purpose of this relatively small and simple booster system was to
save money - by allowing numerous test flights to qualify various solutions to
the myriad problems associated with the development of manned space flight,
especially the problem of escaping from an explosion midway through takeoff.
Capsule aerodynamics under actual reentry conditions was another primary
concern. To gain this kind of experience as soon as possible, its designers had
to keep the clustered booster simple in concept; it should use solid fuel and
existing proven equipment whenever possible, and should be free of any
electronic guidance and control systems.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>The designers made the Little Joe booster assembly to approximate the same
performance that the Army's Redstone booster would have with the capsule
payload. But in addition to being flexible enough to perform a variety of
missions, Little Joe could be made for about one-fifth the basic cost of the
Redstone, would have much lower operating costs, and could be developed and
delivered with much less time and effort. And, unlike the larger launch
vehicles, Little Joe could be shot from the existing facilities at Wallops
Island. It still might even be used to carry a man some day.
<P>Twelve companies responded during November to the invitations for bids to
construct the airframe of Little Joe. The technical evaluation of these
proposals was carried on in much the same manner as for the spacecraft, except
that Langley Research Center itself carried the bulk of the administrative load.
H. H. Maxwell chaired the evaluation board, assisted by Roland D. English,
Johnson, Mershon, and Bland of the Space Task Group. English later became
Langley's Little Joe Project Engineer, Bland the STG Project Engineer, and
Mershon the NASA representative at the airframe factory. The Missile Division of
North American Aviation won the contract on December 29, 1958, and began work
immediately at Downey, California, on its order for seven booster airframes and
one mobile launcher.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>The primary mission objectives for Little Joe as seen in late 1958 (in
addition to studying the capsule dynamics at progressively higher altitudes)
were to test the capsule escape system at maximum dynamic pressure, to qualify
the parachute system, and to verify search and retrieval methods. But since each
group of specialists at work on the project sought to acquire firm empirical
data as soon as possible, more exact priorities had to be established. The first
flights were to secure measurements of inflight and impact forces on the
capsule; later flights were to measure critical parameters at the progressively
higher altitudes [125] of 20,000, 250,000, and 500,000 feet. The minimum aims of
each Little Joe shot could be supplemented from time to time with studies of
noise levels, heat and pressure loads, heatshield separation, and the behavior
of animal riders, so long as the measurements could be accomplished with minimum
telemetry. Since all the capsules boosted by the Little Joe rockets were
expected to be recovered, onboard recording techniques would also contribute to
the simplicity of the system.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>Unique as the only booster system designed specifically and solely for manned
capsule qualifications, Little Joe was also one of the pioneer operational
launch vehicles using the rocket cluster principle. Since the four modified
Sergeants (called either Castor or Pollux rockets, depending upon modification)
and four supplemental Recruit rockets were arranged to fire in various
sequences, the takeoff thrust varied greatly, but maximum design thrust was
almost 230,000 pounds. Theoretically enough to lift a spacecraft of about 4000
pounds on a ballistic path over 100 miles high, the push of these clustered main
engines should simulate the takeoff profile in the environment that the manned
Atlas would experience. Furthermore, the additional powerful explosive pull of
the tractor-rocket escape system could be demonstrated under the most severe
takeoff conditions imaginable. The engineers who mothered Little Joe to maturity
knew it was not much to look at, but they fondly hoped that their ungainly
bastard would prove the legitimacy of most of the ballistic capsule design
concepts, thereby earning its own honor.
<P>Although Little Joe was designed to match the altitude-reaching capability of
the Redstone booster system, and thus to validate the concepts for suborbital
ballistic flights, it could not begin to match the burnout speed at orbiting
altitude given by the Atlas system. Valuable preliminary data on the especially
critical accelerations from aborts at intermediate speeds could be duplicated,
but Little Joe could lift the capsule only to 100 miles, not put it at that
altitude with a velocity approaching 18,000 miles per hour. For this task, a
great deal more, some sort of Big Joe was needed. A Jupiter booster might
simulate fairly closely the worst reentry heating conditions but ultimately only
the Atlas itself could suffice.
<P>Therefore, paralleling the planning of the Little Joe project at Langley, a
counterpart test program was inaugurated by the Space Task Group with special
assistance from the Lewis Research Center in Cleveland. Whereas Little Joe was a
test booster conceived for many different demonstration flight tests, "Big Joe"
was the name for a single test flight with a single overriding objective - to
learn at the earliest practicable date what would happen when the
"steel-balloon" rocket called Atlas powered a ballistic capsule on exit from
Earth's atmosphere. Specifically, an experiment matching the velocity, angle of
entry, time, and attitude at altitude for reentry from Earth orbit needed to be
performed as soon and as exactly as possible by a powered ballistic test flight
so that designs for thermal protection might be verified or modified. The Space
Task Group [126] was most anxious about this; the whole manned satellite program
was balanced tenuously on the stable thrust of the Atlas and the certain
protection of the heatshield.
<P>Public concern over whether the Nation possessed an intercontinental missile
was alleviated on November 28, 1958, when an Atlas first flew its designed range
- more than 6300 miles - down the Atlantic Missile Range toward Ascension
Island. Three weeks later, on December 18, the Atlas scored again with a
secretly prepared first launch into orbit of the entire Atlas vehicle (No. 10-B)
as a communications relay satellite called "Project Score." Roy Johnson of ARPA
claimed he was "sleeping more comfortably each night" after that.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
In the midst of these demonstrations of the power of the prototype Atlas, NASA
Headquarters and the Space Task Group planned to launch the first Atlas test for
the space flight program in June or July 1959.
<P>Gilruth appointed Aleck Bond, the former head of the Structural Dynamics
Section at Langley, to take the reins as project engineer for Big Joe. Bond
began to coordinate, with a real sense of urgency, the work of Langley and Lewis
on the prototype capsule and of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division and
Convair/Astronautics on the Atlas propulsion system. Two Big Joe shots were
arranged initially, but the second was to be merely insurance against the
failure of the first. Although the Lewis laboratory traditionally had been most
closely associated with propulsion problems and therefore was the logical center
for NASA's first experience with large launch vehicles, neither Lewis direction
nor Lewis propulsion experts were directly involved. NASA simply did not have
time to learn the intricacies of launching the Atlas itself. Rather, Lewis
contributed the expertise to design the electronic instrumentation and the
automatic stabilization and control system for the boilerplate capsules being
built jointly by the Lewis and Langley shops.
<P>Bond recalled the initial rationale for Big Joe, alias the Atlas ablation
test:
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the time that the Big Joe flight test program was conceived,
  only limited experimental flight test data existed on the behavior of
  materials and the dynamics of bodies reentering the earth's atmosphere at high
  speeds. These data, which evolved from the ballistic missile program, were
  useful; however, they were not directly applicable to the manned satellite
  reentry case because of the vast differences in the reentry environment
  encountered and in the length of time the vehicles were subjected to the
  environment. There was considerable concern regarding the nature of the
  motions of a blunt body as it gradually penetrated the earth's atmosphere and
  began to decelerate. Of similar concern was the lack of after-body heating
  measurements and knowledge of integrity of ablation materials when exposed to
  the relatively low level, long duration heat pulse which is characteristic of
  the reentry of bodies with low ballistic parameters . . . entering the earth's
  atmosphere at shallow entry angles.<A
  href="notes.htm#n5.42"><SUP>42</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although for Big Joe the Task Group could center its attention on
the capsule, whereas for Little Joe it had to develop the booster as well, the
design and [127] development problems for Big Joe still were sufficient to
cause slippage in the scheduled launch date from early to late summer in 1959.
To launch and recover the capsule safely would require very extensive
familiarization with new procedures. Central among the primary objectives for
Big Joe were the twin needs to determine the performance of the thermal
protection materials and to learn the flight dynamics of the spacecraft during
reentry. Many critical decisions for the project depended upon early, reliable
data on the heatshield, the afterbody radiative shingling, and the dynamic
stability of the "raindrop" configuration during the craft's trajectory back
through the atmosphere.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>Also necessary were evaluations of the aerodynamic and thermodynamic loads
on the capsule all along its flight path and of the operation of its automatic
attitude control system. But certainly nothing was more important in the fall
of 1958 than the need to settle the technical controversy over the heat sink
versus ablation principles for the heatshield. Whether to use absorbing or
vaporizing materials to shield the astronaut from reentry heating was one of
the few major problems remaining to be solved when the manned satellite
project was established.

<H3>Heat Sink Versus Ablation</H3>Since the peak heating rates for this
blunt-body, high-drag configuration were expected to be one whole order of
magnitude less than those experienced by ballistic missiles, no one competent to
judge the issue now considered the "thermal barrier" problem insoluble. Rather,
it had been proven to be no more than a "thermal thicket." Since the
mid-fifties, various civilian and military experimental teams had studied the
reentry problems for ballistic missile warheads, but only part of this research
data was applicable to the different case of the spacecraft. Army and Vitro
Corporation reentry experiments using ablation materials (such as graphite,
teflon, nylon, or lucite) had already demonstrated that Jupiter nose cones
worked quite well as ablators. But NACA preferred to rely on the successful
prior experience of the Air Force with heat-sink metals, particularly copper,
for early Thor nose cones. The results of these thermodynamic studies in
materials science were contradictory, or at least inconclusive. So the manned
satellite project began life officially in October without a commitment to
either method of heat shielding, but with a definite preference for Faget's
prejudice.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
<P>Gilruth, Faget, and other members of the Space Task Group since March 1958
had been leaning toward the heat sink. A 600-pound metallic heat sponge might be
a little heavier but it would be more reliable than a ceramic heat dissipator,
for the simple reason that there was more industrial experience with fabricating
refractory metals than with molding and bonding ablation materials. Some
officials were convinced by the Navy's successful use of a lightweight beryllium
heat sink on Polaris flight tests that beryllium was the answer. The heat sink
method also was thought to have the considerable advantage over ablating
materials of creating less of a "plasma sheath" - the envelope of ionized air
[128] generated by the friction of atmospheric braking. Telemetry and
communications blackouts from this phenomenon might be troublesome. Pending
further study, the Task Group and Silverstein decided to retain the original
specification that a beryllium heatshield be provided by the capsule contractor.
Requiring all the bidders to assume a beryllium shield should give a fairer
evaluation of their proposals. Until Big Joe could test the ablation technique,
no final decision would be made.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
<P>Ablation technology, imprecise by nature, was neither well understood nor
very highly sophisticated as yet, whereas the metallography of heat sink
materials was straightforward, and the thermodynamics of metals was deducible.
Faget believed there would be no intrinsic weight penalty for using a metal
shield; the difficulty of ditching a hot shield without danger had yet to be
solved. There was no disposition to ignore ablation in favor of heat sink. Big
Joe was conceived to resolve the problem. By late November, when Aleck Bond took
charge of it, his presumption was that Big Joe would provide the definitive test
of an ablation heatshield.
<P>Rocketry was not the only means considered for accomplishing high-altitude
qualification tests at the beginning of the program. On their own initiative in
the summer of 1958, Jerome Hammack, John B. Lee, Joe W. Dodson, and other
Langley engineers had begun a modest program of parachute and stability trials
by dropping boilerplate capsule models from C-130 transports provided by the Air
Force. Balloon flights, however, seemed to promise even more effective and
economical means of qualifying by "space-soaking" the complete capsule and its
associated systems. From the Montgolfier brothers in the 1780s to David G.
Simons' Manhigh ascents in 1957 and the contemporary Strato-Lab project of the
Navy, ballooning had always been an attractive way to pierce the vertical
dimension.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>Believing that the environmental conditions at extreme altitude could be
experienced more easily than they could be simulated in vacuum chambers on
Earth, the Space Task Group proceeded with plans to launch balloons carrying
ballistic capsules as gondolas. Tests of instrumentation, retrorockets, drogue
and main parachute systems, and recovery procedures, plus pilot orientation and
training, might be done within a year's time by lighter-than-air ascents.
Contracts were let to the Weather Bureau, the Office of Naval Research, and the
Air Force Cambridge Research Center for planning this flight support program.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>No sooner had these feasibility studies been started than the Space Task
Group discovered how intricate, vast, and expensive had become stratospheric
sounding technology in recent years. The popular craze over Unidentified Flying
Objects during the fifties had been caused partly by atmospheric and cosmic-ray
research with floating objects, enormous Mylar plastic gas bags drifting around
at high altitudes. Preliminary balloon flights for the manned satellite project
threatened to become much more expensive than had been originally anticipated.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>Contract planning, booster procurement, and the need for specialized help
[129] from the military services were central concerns of NASA and the Space
Task Group during their first three months of existence. The possibility of
friction in management relations between NASA and the Defense Department was
also recognized as a potential problem. To facilitate coordinated work and
plans, STG needed in-house representatives in uniform. Efficient administration
demanded liaison officers to serve as single points of contact between STG and
each of the military services. So in December orders were cut for Lieutenant
Colonel Keith G. Lindell of the Air Force, Lieutenant Colonel Martin L. Raines
of the Army, and Commander Paul L. Havenstein of the Navy to report to the Space
Task Group for this function.
<P>In general, relations between NASA and the Department of Defense had
proceeded quite amicably since the drafting of a "Memorandum of Understanding"
in September by the Joint Manned Satellite Panel.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>
However, with so much initiative being taken by the Space Task Group, there was
danger that the concurrent actions of NASA Headquarters and STG might cause some
frustrations and confusions in the Pentagon and among military contractors. NASA
was still too young for its STG to be known. At this stage most of the planning
for budgeting, procurement, tracking, and recovery operations had to be done in
Washington; NASA Headquarters was carefully guarding its prerogative of
conducting interagency business.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
Cooperation between Defense and NASA, and between STG and its own Headquarters,
was good, if not idyllic, during the first 100 days. Nowhere was this more
obvious than in astronaut selection.

<H3>Project Astronaut?</H3>Preliminary procedures for pilot selection had been
worked out by the aeromedical consultants attached to the Space Task Group at
Langley during November. Their plan called for a meeting with representatives
from industry and the services to nominate a pool of 150 men from which 36
candidates would be selected for physical and psychological testing. From this
group 12 would be chosen to go through a nine-month training and qualification
program, after which six finally would be expected to qualify.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>On the basis of this plan, Donlan from Langley, and North in Washington,
together with Allen O. Gamble, a psychologist on leave from the National Science
Foundation, drafted civil service job specifications for individuals who wished
to apply for the position of "Research Astronaut-Candidate." One of the early
plans outlined very well the original expectations of NASA and STG on the type
of man thought necessary. NASA Project A, announcement No. 1, dated December 22,
1958, was a draft invitation to apply for the civil service position of research
astronaut-candidate "with minimum starting salary range of $8,330 to $12,770
(GS-12 to GS-15) depending upon qualifications." This document called the manned
ballistic satellite program "Project Astronaut," and the first section described
the duties of the astronaut:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[130] Although the entire satellite operation will be possible, in
  the early phases, without the presence of man, the astronaut will play an
  important role during the flight. He will contribute by monitoring the cabin
  environment and by making necessary adjustments. He will have continuous
  displays of his position and attitude and other instrument readings, and will
  have the capability of operating the reaction controls, and of initiating the
  descent from orbit. He will contribute to the operation of the communications
  system. In addition, the astronaut will make research observations that cannot
  be made by instruments; these include physiological, astronomical and
  meteorological observations.<A
  href="notes.htm#n5.52"><SUP>52</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Only
males between 25 and 40 years of age, less than 5 feet 11 inches in height, and
with at least bachelor's degrees were to be considered. Stringent professional
experience or graduate study requirements specified five patterns of career
histories most desirable. Candidates who had either three years of work in any
of the physical, mathematical, biological, or psychological sciences, or who had
three years of technical or engineering work in a research and development
program or organization might apply. Or anyone with three years of operation of
aircraft, balloons, or submarines, as commander, pilot, navigator, communications
officer, engineer, or comparable technical position, would be eligible, as would
persons who had completed all requirements for the Ph.D. degree in any
appropriate field of science or engineering plus six months of professional
work. In the case of medical doctors, six months of clinical or research work
beyond the license and internship or residency would be required. Furthermore,
the job qualifications required proof that applicants had demonstrated recently
their "(a) willingness to accept hazards comparable to those encountered in
modern research airplane flight; (b) capacity to tolerate rigorous and severe
environmental conditions; and (c) ability to react adequately under conditions
of stress or emergency." The announcement added:
<BLOCKQUOTE>These three characteristics may have been demonstrated in
  connection with certain professional occupations such as test pilot, crew
  member of experimental submarine or arctic or antarctic explorer. Or they may
  have been demonstrated during wartime combat or military training. Parachute
  jumping or mountain climbing or deep sea diving (including SCUBA) whether as
  occupation or sport, may have provided opportunities for demonstrating these
  characteristics, depending upon heights or depths obtained, frequency and
  duration, temperature and other environment conditions, and emergency episodes
  encountered. Or they may have been demonstrated by experience as an
  observer-under-test for extremes of environmental conditions such as
  acceleration, high or low atmospheric pressure, variation in carbon dioxide
  and oxygen concentration, high and low ambient temperatures, etc. Many other
  examples could be given. It is possible that the different characteristics may
  have been demonstrated by separate types of experience.</BLOCKQUOTE>Finally, as
a last check on ruling out the "lunatics" who might send in crank applications,
this proposed plan for astronaut selection required that each applicant have the
sponsorship of a responsible organization. A nomination form [131] appended to
this announcement would have required 17 multi-point evaluations of the nominee
by some official of the sponsoring institution.
<P>Clearly this astronaut selection plan was sober enough and stringent enough
to ensure an exceptionally high quality applicant, but the plan itself was not
approved and had to be abandoned. President Eisenhower during the 1958 Christmas
holidays decided that the pool of military test pilots already in existence was
quite sufficient a source from which to draw. Since certain classified aspects
would inevitably be involved, military test pilots could most conveniently
satisfy security considerations.<A

<P>Although some in NASA regretted the incongruity of allowing volunteers for
the civilian manned space program to be drawn only from the military, the
decision that the services would provide the candidates greatly simplified pilot
selection procedures. A meeting held at NASA Headquarters during the first week
of January brought together W. Randolph Lovelace II, Brigadier General Don D.
Flickinger, Low, North, Gilruth, and several other members of the Space Task
Group. There the elaborate civil service criteria for selection were boiled down
to a seven-item formula:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Age - less than 40.
  <LI>Height - less than 5 feet, 11 inches.
  <LI>Excellent physical condition.
  <LI>Bachelor's degree or equivalent.
  <LI>Graduate of test pilot school.
  <LI>1500 hours total flying time.
  <LI>Qualified jet pilot.</LI></OL>When these criteria were given to the
Pentagon, service record checks revealed more than 100 men on active duty who
appeared to be qualified. The military services were pleased to cooperate in
further screening. NASA was relieved not to have to issue an open invitation,
and STG was pleased to have Headquarters' aid in the selection.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
<P>Contrary to the feeling expressed in some quarters, even among experimental
test pilots, that the ballistic capsule pilot would be little more than "spam in
a can," most members of STG believed from the beginning that their pilots would
have to do some piloting. As George Low explained their views to Administrator
Glennan, "These criteria were established because of the strong feeling that the
success of the mission may well depend upon the actions of the pilot; either in
his performance of primary functions or backup functions. A qualified jet test
pilot appeared to be best suited for this task."<A
href="notes.htm#n5.55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
Exactly how much "piloting," in the traditional sense, man could do in orbit was
precisely the point in issue.
<P>The least technical task facing NASA and its Space Task Group in the fall of
1958 was choosing a name or short title for the manned satellite project.
Customarily project names for aircraft and missiles were an administrative
convenience best chosen early so as to guarantee general usage by contractors,
press, [132] and public. Langley had earlier suggested to Headquarters three
possible emblems or seals for the use of NASA as a whole: one would have had
Phaeton pulling Apollo across the sky; another would have used the Great Seal of
the United States encompassed by three orbital tracks; and a third proposed a
map of the globe circled by three orbits. These proposals, as well as the name
suggested by Space Task Group for the manned satellite project, lost out to
symbols considered more appropriate in Washington. "Project Astronaut,"
preferred at first by Gilruth to emphasize the man in the satellite, was
overruled largely because it might lead to overemphasis on the personality of
the man.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
<P>Silverstein advocated a systemic name with allegorical overtones and neutral
underpinnings: The Olympian messenger Mercury, denatured by chemistry,
advertising, an automobile, and Christianity, was the most familiar of the gods
in the Greek pantheon to Americans. Mercury, alias Hermes, the son of Zeus and
grandson of Atlas, with his winged sandals and helmet and caduceus, was too rich
in symbolic associations to be denied. The esteemed Theodore von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n had
chosen to speak of Mercury, as had Lucian of Samosata, in terms of the "reentry"
problem and the safe return of man to Earth.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
<P>Had a mythologist been consulted, perhaps the additional associations of
Mercury with masterful thievery, the patronage of traders, and the divinity of
commerce would have proven too humorous. But "Mercury," Glennan and Dryden
agreed on November 26, 1958, was the name most appropriate for the manned
satellite enterprise.<A
href="notes.htm#n5.58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
<P>Greeks might worry about whether Mercury would function in his capacity as
divine herald or as usher to the dead, but Americans, like the Romans, could be
trusted not to worry. On Wright Brothers' Day, December 17, 1958, 55 years after
the famous flights at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Glennan announced publicly in
Washington that the manned satellite program would be called "Project
Mercury."<A
