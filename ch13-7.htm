<H1>The Slayton Case</H1>Donald K. Slayton and Walter M. Schirra, pilot and 
backup, respectively, for Mercury-Atlas 7, had been in training side by side 
with Glenn and Carpenter since the team announcements were made after the MA-5 
flight. On March 15, 1962, NASA announced that Slayton, because of an "erratic 
heart rate," had been replaced by Carpenter as the pilot for MA-7. The 
suddenness of this announcement surprised almost everyone, especially 
journalists who had begun turning out "human interest" copy about Slayton. The 
obvious question was: How could an astronaut, supposedly a perfect physical 
specimen, develop, of all things, a heart condition? [441] The truth was that 
Slayton had been under close medical surveillance for over two years, and he and 
his fellow astronauts each knew how precarious a thing is perfect health.
<P>The astronauts' physician, William Douglas, recognized that Slayton had a 
condition medically termed as idiopathic atrial fibrillation - occasional 
irregularity of a muscle at the top of the heart, caused by unknown factors - 
when the astronauts first rode the centrifuge in August 1959 at Johnsville. 
Douglas noted Slayton was performing his tasks in magnificent fashion, but he 
still thought it best to consult with the chief of cardiology service at the 
Philadelphia Navy Hospital. The consultant assured Slayton and Douglas that the 
condition was of no consequence and should not influence Slayton's eventual 
choice as a flight astronaut. The astronaut's physician did not accept this 
appraisal as a final diagnostic decision. He and Slayton visited the Air Force's 
School of Aviation Medicine in San Antonio, Texas, where a member of the 
internal medicine staff voiced the same opinion. Sometime later Douglas learned 
that this individual wrote to Administrator James E. Webb, making a 
recommendation that Slayton should not be assigned a flight.
<P>After sojourns at various medical centers, Douglas informed Mercury Director 
Gilruth of Slayton's condition during the fall of 1959. Gilruth, in turn, 
briefed NASA Headquarters in Washington. Douglas also relayed the information to 
the Air Force Surgeon General's office and was advised to take no action. For 
some time thereafter the "Slayton file" lay dormant. The astronaut was selected 
as a pilot in November 1961 and began training for his flight.
<P>Shortly after the beginning of the new year, NASA Administrator Webb, 
remembering the dissenting vote he had received from an Air Force physician, 
and, mindful of the fact that Slayton was an Air Force officer on loan, directed 
a complete reevaluation of the case. In response Douglas called together Stanley 
White, William S. Augerson, and James P. Henry, physicians assigned to the 
Mercury program, to study the matter in detail. Their considered recommendation 
was that Slayton should continue as the pilot for MA-7. From MSC, Douglas 
journeyed to Washington to brief Brigadier General Charles H. Roadman and 
Colonel George M. Knauf, Chief and Deputy Chief of the Office of Space Medicine 
in NASA Headquarters. These doctors also recommended that Slayton remain on 
space flight status. The reopening of the case was brought to the attention of 
the Air Force Surgeon General, who convened a board of eight flight surgeons to 
review the matter. The MSC physician appeared before that body, presenting it 
with every facet of the medical file. Slayton also appeared. The board judged 
Slayton to be "fully qualified as an Air Force pilot and as an astronaut."
<P>Administrator Webb referred the case to a group of three nationally eminent 
cardiologists - Proctor Harvey, professor of cardiology, Georgetown University; 
Thomas Mattingly, heart specialist, Washington Hospital Center; and Eugene 
Braunwall, National Institutes of Health. Their consensus was that they were 
[442] unable to state conclusively whether Slayton's physiological performance 
would be jeopardized by his heart condition. Because of this unknown, they felt 
that if NASA had an available astronaut who did not "fibrillate," then he should 
be used rather than Slayton. Braunwall added that if there was sufficient time 
he would like to subject Slayton to some physiological tests.<A

<P>Asked several years later if he had known about his heart condition when he 
was chosen for Project Mercury, Slayton replied:<A

<BLOCKQUOTE>No, I didn't, but in the examinations prior to the August 1959 
  centrifuge program at AMAL the medics discovered that my heart skipped a beat 
  now and then. I went ahead with the centrifuge runs and began to watch myself 
  very closely, noticing that quite often after supper my pulse would be 
  irregular. I would get out and run a mile and everything was normal again. I 
  was terribly concerned over what in my diet might be causing it, but every 
  hypothesis turned up wrong. Concern in STG and even NASA Headquarters got so 
  great in 1960 that I was sent to all kinds of exhaustive examinations under 
  the best heart specialists in the country - in Philadelphia, San Antonio, and 
  New York City. I was examined by different groups of heart specialists who 
  could find nothing wrong. Even Paul Dudley White, Ike's personal physician, 
  gave me a clean bill of health but rendered an operational rather than a 
  diagnostic decision, recommending that the unknown factor in my heart murmur 
  not be added to all the other unknowns for manned space flight.</BLOCKQUOTE>The 
Slayton decision was irrevocable, even though Gilruth and William Douglas 
disagreed with the high-level medical verdict. Slayton, they felt, had withstood 
greater stresses in the training program than he would have experienced had he 
been rocketed into orbit. On the other hand, Administrator Webb, because of the 
unknown elements, concurred with the cardiologists that it was neither safe nor 
politic to subject an individual who had a heart condition, however slight, to 
the stresses of orbital flight when there were other flight- trained astronauts 
available.
<P>Shortly after the replacement, Douglas, having completed a three-year tour of 
detached duty with NASA, returned to his career service, the Air Force. Some 
newsmen were quick to conclude that this action suggested bitterness. They had 
not known that Douglas had been invited to the medical hearings but had known 
that Douglas had been outspoken in his opposition to Slayton's removal from 
flight status. Stanley White denied the charge in a news conference, maintaining 
that Douglas' return to the Air Force had been arranged for "better than six 
months."<A

Of the original team of astronauts, Slayton had been considered the professional 
test pilot par excellence, largely because of his overwhelming experience and 
flight time. He soon became the coordinator of astronaut activities. He never 
abandoned hope that he still might make a space flight. As late as December 
1964, more than a year and a half after Project Mercury had completed its last 
flight and when Project Gemini was nearing its first manned flight, the unlucky 
astronaut remarked, "I've never been grounded and I'm not now. I still hope to 
get my chance to go beyond the atmosphere."
