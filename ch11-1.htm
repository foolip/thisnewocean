<H1>Suborbital Flights into Space</H1>[341] AT 9:34 a.m. on May 5, 1961, about 
45 million Americans sat tensely before their television screens and watched a 
slim black-and-white Redstone booster, capped with a Mercury spacecraft manned 
by Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., lift off its pad at Cape Canaveral and go 
roaring upward through blue sky toward black space.
<P>At 2.3 seconds after launch, Shepard's voice came through clearly to Mercury 
Control; minutes later the millions heard the historic transmission: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ahh, Roger; lift-off and the clock is started . . . Yes, sir, 
  reading you loud and clear. This is <I>Freedom 7</I>. The fuel is go; 1.2 g; 
  cabin at 14 psi; oxygen is go . . . <I>Freedom 7</I> is still 
go!</BLOCKQUOTE>America's first man in space was in flight only 15 minutes and 
22 seconds and was weightless only a third of that time. <I>Freedom 7</I> rose 
to an altitude of 116.5 miles, attained a maximum speed of 5180 miles per hour, 
and landed 302 miles downrange from the Cape. Shepard experienced a peak stress 
of 6 g during booster acceleration and less than 12 g on reentry. Recovery 
operations went perfectly, the spacecraft was undamaged, and Shepard was in 
excellent and exuberant condition.<A

<P>In the light of later American space accomplishments, the flight of 
<I>Freedom 7</I> was impressive for its benchmark of technical excellence in the 
new technology of manned space flight and its hallmark of open media reporting. 
When compared, as it inevitably was, with the previous April 12 orbital flight 
of Yuri Gagarin, MR-3 was anticlimatic.
<P>Ever since December 1958, when T. Keith Glennan, the NASA Administrator, had 
announced Project Mercury, the American public had awaited the first manned 
Mercury flight with fairly general misgivings. Many people whose expectations 
had been stimulated by publicity became impatient at the long delays and 
postponements. Some deplored the whole space program as wasteful and of doubtful 
value. A few still believed space travel was impossible for human beings.
<P>[342] Then, on February 22, 1961, the Space Task Group announced that 
Shepard, John H. Glenn, and Virgil I. Grissom had been chosen to begin special 
training for the MR-3 vault into space. More than a month before the public 
announcement, Robert R. Gilruth personally had made his choice, even to the 
exact flight order of the men selected. In early January, back at Langley, the 
day after he had bid outgoing Administrator Glennan goodbye in Washington, 
Gilruth had decided to inform the flight crewmen of their selection status. He 
drove over to the temporary building housing the astronaut offices, called the 
seven men together, and told them of his decision that Shepard would be the 
first flight astronaut.<A

And while the West awaited the next development,Gagarin made his 108—minute 
near-polar orbit of Earth aboard the five-ton <I>Vostok I</I> (meaning East) 
spacecraft.
<P>Although some Americans professed disbelief in the Gagarin flight, a majority 
surely felt a twinge of nationalistic pain in admitting the Soviets had won the 
first honor in the two-nation race into space. When Shepard's flight took place, 
barely a month after Gagarin, even the skeptics appeared to derive consolation 
from the fact that the American launch and recovery had been made in the light 
of full publicity, with all world news media participating, whereas the Vostok 
flight had been veiled in official secrecy until after the fact.
<P><I>Freedom 7</I>, Shepard's capsule, missed what had been widely considered a 
"realistic" launch schedule by six months. When the capsule had finally been 
delivered to the Cape on December 9, 1960, some assumed the flight could be made 
at once. But 21 weeks of preparation - not all of it anticipated - were required 
by STG's Cape preflight checkout group and a host of McDonnell engineers based 
at the Florida site. Reaction control system checkout and rework were 
responsible for a launch schedule postponement to March 6, 1961. Replacement of 
damaged and corroded peroxide lines forced a further delay of eight days. 
Rerunning the simulated mission test and correcting structural and equipment 
defects were other time-consuming problems.<A

<P>Thus, technically, it was May 2 before the launch of capsule No. 7 might have 
been made. Then why not use capsule No. 8 or 9 or 11? Because capsule No. 7 had 
been selected in the summer and groomed since October 1960 as McDonnell's best 
product to date, the only porthole version of the capsule that had been or would 
be man-rated in all respects. By January 1961, after the MR-1A flight had used 
up Mercury-Redstone booster No. 3, the one originally intended for the first 
man-launch vehicle, it was clear that Redstone No. 7 would boost capsule No. 7. 
At the end of March, when booster No. 7 arrived at the Cape, Shepard already 
knew he was Robert R. Gilruth's prime choice to fly it. "There was no hope," 
said Shepard, "that a later model of the capsule incorporating our suggestions 
could be ready in time for MR-3." So capsule No. 7 on booster No. 7 should be 
the first combination of a series of at least seven flights to put Americans 
into space. "What better name or call-sign could I choose than <I>Freedom 
7</I>?" asked Shepard.<A

<P>[343] Although the delays were disheartening, there were compensatory 
benefits in the way of astronaut training. Some psychologists feared that this 
long time lapse before the flight actually took place might cause "over 
training" and staleness. But in the postflight debriefing, Shepard complimented 
the so-called "over training"; he remarked that the similarity of training 
conditions to actual flight conditions was a key factor in making the mission 
seem almost routine. In addition, new and better procedures were developed 
during repeated rehearsals of the mission, which might not have come to light 
had the training not been expanded a few weeks.

<P><A name=source2><SUP>2</A> </SUP>Tape of press conference, Mercury 
astronauts, Cape Canaveral, Feb. 22, 1961. At the conference Robert R. Gilruth 
pointed out that the four remaining astronauts were not eliminated, since there 
would be other flights. He said it was simply that at this point in the program 
a few had to be selected to participate in a particular mission, and that it was 
only practical to select those best prepared. The others would continue 
training. Nancy Lowe, secretary to the Mercury astronauts for more than four 
years, said in an interview with the authors on Feb. 27, 1964, that STG had been 
besieged for interviews only after the announcement that Shepard, Glenn, and 
Grissom had been selected to train for the first flight.
