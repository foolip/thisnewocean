<H1>Preparations for MA-8</H1>While the long-duration mission studies were in 
progress and the mission rules and directives were being prepared and issued, 
other personnel of the NASA military-industry complex were readying the 
spacecraft, booster, and recovery forces. The astronaut and alternate pilot were 
in intensive training.
<P>[465] The Manned Spacecraft Center allocated spacecraft Nos. 16 and 19 for 
the six-orbit mission, with No. 16 as the preferred vehicle. No. 16 had arrived 
at Cape Canaveral in January 1962, while No. 19 had followed two months later. 
Rework to incorporate a six-orbit capability was done at the Cape by the MSC 
Preflight Operations Division with the help of McDonnell technicians. The work 
and testing began slowly but were well underway in April. In that month 
temperature surveys at the critical points on the capsule were completed, the 
environmental control system passed its altitude-chamber tests, and the reaction 
control system was exercised satisfactorily. Minor troubles cropped up, as 
usual. Emergency oxygen rate valves stuck. Water coolant flowed too freely. The 
cabin's oxygen leakage rate was too high. Each difficulty slowly was overcome, 
but it became evident that a hoped-for August launching might slip at least a 
month.<A

<P>The Mercury Project Office had pronounced 5.4 pounds of lithium hydroxide 
sufficient for oxygen purification for the MA-8 mission, but the MSC Life 
Systems Division personnel checking this theory found the absorbers 
unsatisfactory. Canisters containing 4.6 pounds of the mixture had been used in 
the three-orbit spacecraft and tests showed that this amount of the chemical 
functioned to keep the air breathable for 34.5 hours before carbon-dioxide 
levels rose too high. Then canisters supposedly containing 5.4 pounds of 
absorbent were tested, with both fixed and variable inputs of heat, water vapor, 
and carbon dioxide, and with a human subject breathing the oxygen. To the 
amazement of the testers, the lifetimes of these canisters averaged only 
slightly higher than those that were partly filled.
<P>Then it occurred to somebody in the division to weigh the canisters. Each 
proved to have been packed about half a pound short. Finally the completely 
filled canisters were tested for as long as 71 hours before breaking down, 
demonstrating that the original design met the development demands, after all. 
Well filled absorbers would qualify for a day-long mission as well as for six 
orbits.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>As the work continued at the Cape on spacecraft No. 16, Scott Carpenter made 
his fuel-thirsty, three-orbit flight on May 24. During <I>Aurora 7</I>'s 
postflight analysis MSC engineers, including G. Merritt Preston's checkout crew, 
took new and closer looks at the attitude and reaction control systems. They 
decided that attitude thrusters slightly different in design would have to be 
installed in the MA-8 spacecraft. While Preston's men were implementing this 
decision, they also managed to get No. 16's cabin oxygen leakage rate down to a 
highly satisfactory 460 cubic centimeters per minute, although in the weeks 
ahead this rate would rise slightly.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>Other results from MA-7, as recorded from telemetry data, as reported by 
Carpenter, and as revealed by examination of flight-tested <I>Aurora 7</I>, had 
intensified the flurry of activity all along the line to prepare No. 16 for its 
flight. Carpenter had many suggestions regarding spacecraft configuration. The 
heavy periscope, he said, was useless on Earth's nightside; the window alone 
could be used to find the spacecraft's attitude. The determined workers for 
spacecraft weight [466] reduction were delighted to hear this assessment. But 
the MA-7 postflight inspection team reported that Carpenter's landing error had 
been caused by a faulty yaw attitude, largely because Carpenter had performed a 
final control systems check just prior to retrofire and had used the window 
mainly as his chief yaw reference. Could the window and the pilot be trusted? 
the Mercury team wondered. Would the periscope have assisted in correcting the 
attitude and the resultant overshoot? The only way to find out the answers was 
to fly the periscope again.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
<P>So for MA-8 the periscope became, in a sense, an experimental instrument. 
Using both the periscope and the window for spacecraft attitude reference, 
Schirra would check the position of his capsule carefully on Earth's day and 
night sides. Then he would check his visual judgment to gauge attitude, 
comparing his ability against the scope and instrument readings.
<P>Having decided to retain the periscope, the mission planners and Cape 
preparations team for MA-8 butted into fresh difficulties. The experiment 
schedule had called for an ultraviolet airglow spectrograph to be put in the 
periscope's well. This spectrograph had been developed through the intensive 
work of Albert Boggess, III, at the Goddard Space Flight Center upon the request 
of the NASA Headquarters Ad Hoc Committee on Scientific Tasks and Training for 
Man-in-Space. Now the decision to carry the periscope forced the withdrawal of 
the experiment, creating some disappointment among NASA's scientifically 
interested personnel. Even the implementation of this decision turned out to be 
somewhat of a problem. Preston's men tried to use the periscope from the 
alternate spacecraft (No. 19) but found it to be defective. By the end of August 
they managed to install a standard periscope, "cannibalized" from spacecraft No. 
15.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>Carpenter, the second astronaut to land with empty fuel tanks in the manned 
orbital program, also suggested that a control-mode selector switch be 
integrated with the control system to seal off the high thrusters until they 
were needed for fast reaction maneuvers. The Project Office approved, and this 
fuel-saving switch was installed in the MA-8 spacecraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>Aside from these and other minor modifications spacecraft No. 16 was a 
duplicate of <I>Aurora 7</I>. Many of the technical changes were aimed at weight 
reduction, fuel conservation, and adding extra supplies for a longer mission. 
Deletions included the astronaut-observer camera, one of two redundant command 
receiver-decoders, and the high-frequency voice transceiver. To increase pilot 
comfort and save weight, the preflight preparations crew extracted the lower leg 
section of the couch and substituted toe, heel, and knee restraints. During the 
orbital phase of the mission, the knee restraints could be loosened. An extra 15 
pounds of coolant water and an improved fastening technique for the heatshield 
center plug completed the list of additions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>While the engineers were working, Astronaut Schirra proceeded through the 
most efficient flight training program yet undertaken. Except for added yaw 
recognition displays, he used the same procedures trainers that his predecessors 
had used; [467] having a definite flight plan, he could practice on his own 
specific mission profile. He was able to work through his simulated retrofire 
and reentry tasks in the Langley procedures trainer before the device was 
dismantled for shipment to Houston. And for personal physical conditioning, he 
often went swimming and water skiing.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>Late in July, Preston reported that the work schedule for spacecraft No. 16 
was aimed at a September 18 launch date. When the flight preparation crews added 
a sixth day to their work week to compensate for various delays, the MSC 
managers remained optimistic.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>Some worry among the mission planners had been injected in July when Project 
Dominic, an Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) high-atmosphere nuclear test over the 
Pacific, had created a new zone of radiation, lower than the Van Allen belts. In 
the face of this possible threat to an orbiting man, AEC, NASA, and McDonnell 
carefully studied a number of satellite and probe launchings in August designed 
to explore the belt. After the solar batteries of several satellites failed - 
including <I>Ariel I</I>, the world's first international satellite project, 
which developed operational difficulties probably attributable to Dominic - the 
investigators reported that the new radiation circled Earth at the geomagnetic 
equator and was about 400 miles wide and 4000 miles deep. Sounding rockets by 
telemetry data indicated rapid and continuing decay of radioactivity in the 
corridors of the next Mercury mission. By the end of August the radiation 
hazards seemed negligible. The MSC engineers, distrusting the reports that all 
danger had disappeared, installed a radiation dosimeter on the spacecraft hatch, 
provided the pilot with a hand-held model, and attached four more to Schirra's 
pressure suit.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> 
The hand-held model could provide real-time indications during the flight.
<P>Besides some labor-management difficulties that momentarily hampered the 
activities of the aerospace industry at this time, the booster for MA-8 
contributed its share of troubles. Atlas 113-D was to have been delivered to 
Cape Canaveral toward the end of July, but it failed its initial composite test 
at the San Diego factory. Finally it was shipped on August 8. Then the Air 
Force, revealing that its Atlas program had suffered four recent turbopump 
failures, advised the Manned Spacecraft Center that No. 113-D would be put 
through a flight-readiness static firing. Since the MA-8 launch vehicle would be 
the first one in the Mercury program not having the two-second post-ignition 
hold-down time, the Air Force felt the static firing to be an important 
requirement.
<P>A one-week slippage was now added. But before the test could be made, the Air 
Force and Convair inspectors found a fuel leak in a seam weld on the booster. 
Calculating the time required for work to be done, on September 6 the 
Mercury–Atlas launch operations committee rescheduled the mechanical and 
electrical matings of spacecraft and booster and three planned simulated 
flights. These tests would continue through September 24, making October 3 the 
most likely day for the MA-8 launch.
<P>[469] Atlas 113-D actually differed little from its predecessors in the 
manned flight program. It incorporated a dozen or so technical changes from the 
107-D configuration that had propelled Carpenter into orbit. The fuel tank 
insulation had been removed as a solution to some of the difficulties that had 
beset John Glenn's booster (Carpenter's launch vehicle had retained the 
insulation). More important, baffled fuel injectors (which had been found in 
static firing tests to virtually eliminate the possibility of combustion 
instability) and the accompanying hyperbolic ignition (in which fuel and 
oxidizer ignite on contact) were added to 113-D. These innovations, 
therefore, eliminated the two-second hold-down at ignition, saved fuel, made for 
smoother initial combustion, and provided a safer liftoff.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>The tracking network for MA-8 was augmented by five airborne relay stations, 
in the form of five Air Force C-130s, to cover areas that otherwise would have 
been out of communications range of the ground sites. The C-130s, each equipped 
with ultra-high-frequency and very-high-frequency equipment for voice relay, 
were based at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida; Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto 
Rico; and Midway Island.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> 
The mixed recovery force, deployed by the Department of Defense, included 19 
ships in the Atlantic and nine in the Pacific. Aircraft numbering 134 of various 
types covered primary and secondary spacecraft landing areas. In all, about 
17,000 men, including over 100 aeromedical monitors and specialists, made up the 
global MA-8 recovery forces.
<P>Recovery commanders in the Pacific directed a training course in spacecraft 
and astronaut retrieval for appropriate teams, using boilerplate capsules, 
flotation collars, and other gear provided by MSC. Major General Leighton I. 
Davis and Walter C. Williams made an inspection tour to the Pacific to evaluate 
the training program and the overall recovery readiness picture. Later Kraft, 
reading their findings, reported that preparations and materials seemed 
"reasonably well" developed. But he was disappointed that NASA had been unable 
to enlist the support of another Navy radar ship equipped with FPS-16 equipment 
for C-band operation and thus had to rely on two S-band ships instead. Kraft 
felt that S-band radar, called "Verlort" for its 700-mile "very long range 
tracking" ability, was less reliable than the C-band.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>If recovery was to go smoothly, interservice misunderstandings like the one 
that had developed during Carpenter's rescue would have to be avoided. General 
Davis, the DOD military representative for Mercury support operations, had 
reported to Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara that the delay at Mercury 
Control in the decision to pick up Carpenter had stemmed partially from a lack 
of direct communication with the astronaut. To overcome this breakdown, the 
recovery room in the Control Center was modified to permit almost instantaneous 
communication between tracking stations and recovery forces; and Schirra's 
spacecraft was equipped with a long extension line, which would permit him to 
maintain voice contact even in the life raft. The extended period of suspense 
that climaxed Carpenter's mission should never happen again in Project 
Mercury.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>[470] At this juncture, President Kennedy set out on a tour of the space 
centers of the South to inspect and show his interest not only in the 
preparations for MA-8 but also in the vast array of technological talents being 
mobilized for the accelerated space program, including the first lunar voyage. 
Kennedy flew down to Cape Canaveral to see the Merritt Island Launch Area that 
was being built for the huge Saturn V rockets. Then he went on to Houston to see 
the site for the management and control center on the Texas coastal prairie. 
Before a sweltering crowd half-filling the 72,000-seat Rice University stadium, 
the President spoke on September 12, 1962, in earnest defense of his proclaimed 
program for manned exploration of the Moon. "No man can fully grasp how far and 
how fast we have come," said Kennedy. "The exploration of space will go ahead, 
whether we join it or not. . . . It is one of the great adventures of all time, 
and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay 
behind in the race for space. . . . We intend to be first. . . . to become the 
world's leading space-faring nation." The youthful President then addressed one 
of his memorable statements to those who had asked, "Why send a man to the 
Moon?" 
<BLOCKQUOTE>We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be 
  gained and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the 
  progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all 
  technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for 
  good or ill depends on us, and only if the United States occupies a position 
  of preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of 
  peace or a new, terrifying theater of war. . . . Space can be explored and 
  mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistake that 
  man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source21"><SUP>21</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>If 
President Kennedy's remarks in Houston, later at the McDonnell factory in St. 
Louis, and elsewhere, proved an accurate reflection of most Americans' 
sentiments about the space program, his words persuaded few of the vocal 
economic, political, and scientific conservatives who were watching costs soar 
along with the engineering effort. The NASA space budget alone for this fiscal 
year was over $5 billion, which represented a tax of about 40 cents on each 
American per week; but the Nation was prosperous, the economy seemed sound, and 
critics of the "space circus" were seldom heard.
<P>Toward the end of September, all mission preparations, the astronaut, the 
spacecraft, and the launch vehicle reached a high state of readiness. The 
spacecraft and the booster mated well; the simulated tests before mission ticked 
off without further hitches; and October 3 thus remained a promising launch 
date.
<P>Schirra, viewing the elaborate preparation effort, studying his flight plan, 
and knowing that his mission involved the evaluation of the capsule's ability to 
accomplish a day-long flight, recognized the immensity of the engineering effort 
behind him. In honor of these labors, he selected the name <I>Sigma 7</I> for 
his spacecraft. "Since this was to be an engineering evaluation," he explained, 
the name chosen for capsule No. 16 was that of an engineering symbol for 
summation, Sigma, [471] with the number seven added to it for the seven-member 
Mercury astronaut team. "Thus," he said, "was derived the name and symbol that 
was painted on the spacecraft, Sigma 7."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>On the final lap toward launch day, Schirra began a controlled diet on 
September 21; nine days later physician Howard A. Minners placed him on his 
low-residue diet. Schirra complained mildly while adjusting to the low-residue 
food, but in every other respect he was primed and ready, mentally and 
physically.
<P>As always when flight day neared, the Mercury operations team through the 
Weather Bureau support group kept a watchful eye on existing weather 
disturbances in both the Atlantic and Pacific areas. About 400 miles north by 
northeast of Puerto Rico, tropical storm Daisy churned the waters of the 
Atlantic, while three typhoons, Dinah, Emma, and Frieda, whipped Pacific waves. 
On October 1, Walter Williams told the news corps covering the flight at the 
Cape that except for the weather "all elements of the MA-8 flight are in a go 
condition as of this time." By 5 p.m. the following day, Williams was satisfied 
with the chances for success and decided to launch as planned.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-3.htm#source23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
<P>Notified by Williams that he had a 7 o'clock liftoff "appointment" the next 
morning, Schirra dined leisurely and retired early. Without any sleep-inducing 
medications, the pilot drifted into slumber shortly after 8 p.m. and got about 
five hours of sound rest. Minners roused Schirra at 1:40 a.m. to begin the 
precise readiness routine. The astronaut showered, shaved, and met with Gilruth, 
Williams, Slayton, and Minners for breakfast. He ate heartily the "astronaut 
launching breakfast," [472] consisting of eggs, filet, dry toast, orange juice, 
and coffee, plus a portion of a bluefish that he had speared the day before. The 
major preflight physical having taken place two days earlier, Minners checked 
Schirra briefly, pronouncing him in excellent physical condition. After Minners 
applied the physiological sensors to the astronaut's body, Schirra signaled to 
Joe W. Schmitt to assist him in donning the silvery pressure suit. At a little 
past 4 o'clock, Schirra and his attending retinue emerged from Hangar S.
<P>As Schirra headed for the transfer van, Alvin B. Webb, a veteran 
space-newsman assigned by the press pool to report activities in that area, 
observed that the astronaut seemed to be unusually relaxed and smiling, as 
compared to previous astronauts on their way to the launch pad. Seconds later, 
Schirra, carrying his portable air conditioner, climbed aboard the van for a 
leisurely ride toward the flood-lit spire in the distance. As the van reached 
the blockhouse and gantry complex, Byron G. MacNabb, representing the 
Convair-Atlas team, greeted Schirra and said: "On behalf of the crew of Pad 14, 
I wish you a successful flight and a happy landing." Acknowledging this 
salutation, Schirra boarded the elevator and moved up the gantry. At 4:41 a.m. 
the astronaut slid inside <I>Sigma 7</I>.<A
