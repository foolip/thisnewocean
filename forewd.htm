<H1>FOREWORD</H1>
<P>[v]WHEN the Congress created the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration in 1958, it charged NASA with the responsibility "to contribute 
materially to . . . the expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the 
atmosphere and space" and "provide for the widest practicable and appropriate 
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof." 
NASA wisely interpreted this mandate to include responsibility for documenting 
the epochal progress of which it is the focus. The result has been the 
development of a historical program by NASA as unprecedented as the task of 
extending man's mobility beyond his planet. This volume is not only NASA's 
accounting of its obligation to disseminate information to our current 
generation of Americans. It also fulfills, as do all of NASA's future-oriented 
scientific-technological activities, the further obligation to document the 
present as the heritage of the future.
<P>The wide-ranging NASA history program includes chronicles of day-to-day space 
activities; specialized studies of particular fields within space science and 
technology; accounts of NASA's efforts in organization and management, where its 
innovations, while less known to the public than its more spectacular space 
shots, have also been of great significance; narratives of the growth and 
expansion of the space centers throughout the country, which represent in 
microcosm many aspects of NASA's total effort; program histories, tracing the 
successes - and failures - of the various projects that mark man's progress into 
the Space Age; and a history of NASA itself, incorporating in general terms the 
major problems and challenges, and the responses thereto, of our entire civilian 
space effort. The volume presented here is a program history, the first in a 
series telling of NASA's pioneering steps into the Space Age. It deals with the 
first American manned-spaceflight program: Project Mercury.
<P>Although some academicians might protest that this is "official" history, it 
is official only in the fact that it has been prepared and published with the 
support and cooperation of NASA. It is not "official" history in the sense of 
presenting a point of view supposedly that of NASA officialdom - if anyone could 
determine what <I>the</I> "point of view" of such a complex organism might be. 
Certainly, the authors were allowed to pursue their task with the fullest 
freedom and in accordance with the highest scholarly standards of the history 
profession. They [vi] were permitted unrestricted access to source materials and 
participants. Furthermore, they have with humility and some courage attempted to 
document what emerges as a complex accounting of the purposes of science, 
technology, and public funding in a challenging new area of human endeavor.
<P>Some classical historians may deplore the short lapse of time between the 
actual events and the historical narration of them. Others may boggle at the 
mass of full documentary sources with which the Project Mercury historians have 
had to cope. There are offsetting advantages, however. The very freshness of the 
events and accessibility of their participants have made possible the writing of 
a most useful treatise of lasting historical value. Future historians may 
rewrite this history of Project Mercury for their own age, but they will indeed 
be thankful to their predecessors of the NASA historical program for providing 
them with the basic data as well as the view of what this pioneering venture in 
the Space Age meant to its participants and to contemporary historians.
