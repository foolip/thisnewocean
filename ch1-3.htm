<H1>The Highway to Space</H1>
<P>Space flight, however, was something else. While in one sense atmospheric 
flight was the first step toward space flight, extra-atmospheric transport 
involves much more than a logical extension of aviation technology. The 
airplane, powered either by a reciprocating or a jet engine, is a creature and a 
captive of the atmosphere, because either powerplant depends on air - more 
properly, oxygen - for its operation, and in space there is no air. But the 
rocket, unlike the gas turbine, pulsejet, ramjet, or piston engine, needs no 
air. It carries everything needed for propulsion within itself - its own fuel 
and some form of oxidizer, commonly liquid oxygen, to burn the fuel. So the 
rocket engine operates independently of its environment; in fact, its efficiency 
increases as it climbs away from the frictional density of the lower atmosphere 
to the thin air of the stratosphere and into the airlessness of space.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source31"><SUP>31</A></SUP>
<P>Yet even the rocket research airplanes were a long way from spacecraft. 
Although some of these vehicles provided data on the use of reaction controls 
for steering in the near vacuum of the upper atmosphere, they were designed to 
produce considerable aerodynamic lift for control within the lower atmosphere; 
and, in terms of the mass to be accelerated, their powerplants burned too 
briefly and produced too little thrust to counterbalance the oppressive force of 
gravity. Fulfillment of the age-old desire to travel to the heavens, even 
realization of Hale's nineteenth-century concept of a manned sphere circling 
Earth in lower space, would have to await the development of rockets big enough 
to boost thousands of pounds and to break the lock of gravity.
<P>Although black-powder rockets, invented by the Chinese, had been used for 
centuries for festive and military purposes, not until the late nineteenth and 
early twentieth centuries did imaginative individuals in various parts of the 
world begin seriously to consider the liquid-fueled rocket as a vehicle for 
spatial conveyance. The history of liquid-fueled rocketry, and thus of manned 
space flight, is closely linked to the pioneering careers of three men - the 
Russian Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935), the American Robert 
Hutchings Goddard (1882-1945), and the German-Romanian Hermann Oberth (1894- ).
<P>Tsiolkovsky, for most of his life an obscure teacher of mathematics, authored 
a series of remarkable technical essays on such subjects as reaction propulsion 
with liquid-propellant rockets, attainable velocities, fuel compositions, and 
oxygen supply and air purification for space travelers. He also wrote what 
apparently was the first technical discussion of an artificial Earth 
satellite.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source32"><SUP>32</A></SUP> 
Although virtually unknown in the West at the time of his death, in 1935, 
Tsiolkovsky was honored by the Soviets and had helped establish a long Russian 
tradition of [14] astronautics. This tradition helps to account for the 
U.S.S.R.'s advances with rocket-assisted airplane takeoffs and small 
meteorological rockets of the 1930s and her space achievements of the 1950s and 
1960s.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source33"><SUP>33</A></SUP>
<P>In terms of experimentation, Goddard, professor of physics at Clark 
University, was by far the most important of the rocket pioneers.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source34"><SUP>34</A></SUP> 
As early as 1914 he secured a patent for a small liquid-fueled rocket engine. 
Six years later he published a highly technical paper on the potential uses of a 
rocket with such an engine for studying atmospheric conditions at altitudes from 
20 to 50 miles. Toward the end of the paper he mentioned the possibility of 
firing a rocket containing a powder charge that could be exploded on the Moon. 
"It remains only to perform certain necessary preliminary experiments before an 
apparatus can be constructed that will carry recording instruments to any 
desired altitude," he concluded.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source35"><SUP>35</A></SUP>
<P>Goddard's life for the next 20 years was devoted to making those "necessary 
preliminary experiments." Working in the 1920s in Massachusetts with financial 
support from various sources and in the New Mexico desert with Guggenheim 
Foundation funds during the succeeding decade, Goddard compiled an amazing list 
of "firsts" in rocketry. Among other things, he carried out the first recorded 
launching of a liquid-propellant rocket (March 16, 1926), adapted the gyroscope 
to guide rockets, installed movable deflector vanes in a rocket exhaust nozzle 
for stability and steering, patented a design for a multistage rocket, developed 
fuel pumps for liquid-rocket motors, experimented with self-cooling and 
variable-thrust motors, and developed automatically deployed parachutes for 
recovering his instrumented rockets. Finally, he was the first of the early 
rocket enthusiasts to go beyond theory and design into the realm of "systems 
engineering" - the complex and hand-dirtying business of making airframes, fuel 
pumps, valves, and guidance devices compatible, and of doing all the other 
things necessary to make a rocket fly. Goddard put rocket theory into practice, 
as his 214 patents attest.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source36"><SUP>36</A></SUP>
<P>Goddard clearly deserves the fame that has attached to his name in recent 
years, but in many ways he was more inventor than scientist. He deliberately 
worked in lonely obscurity, jealously patented virtually all of his innovations, 
and usually refused to share his findings with others. Consequently his work was 
not as valuable as it might have been to such of his contemporaries as the young 
rocket buffs who formed the American Rocket Society in the early thirties and 
vainly sought his counsel.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source37"><SUP>37</A></SUP>
<P>Goddard's disdain for team research prompted his refusal to work with the 
California Institute of Technology Rocket Research Project, instigated in 1936 
by the renowned von Kármán, then director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical 
Laboratory at CalTech. The CalTech group undertook research in the fundamentals 
of high-altitude sounding rockets, including thermodynamics, the principles of 
reaction, fuels, thrust measurements, and nozzle shapes. Beginning in 1939 the 
Guggenheim Laboratory, under the first Federal contract for rocket [16] 
research, carried out studies and experiments for the Army Air Forces, 
especially on rocket-assisted takeoffs for aircraft. These takeoff rockets were 
called JATO (for "Jet-Assisted Take-Off") units, because, as one of the CalTech 
scientists recalled, "the word 'rocket' was of such bad repute that [we] felt it 
advisable to drop the use of the word. It did not return to our vocabulary until 
several years later ...."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source38"><SUP>38</A></SUP> 
In 1944, with the Guggenheim Laboratory working intently on Army and Navy 
contracts for JATO units and small bombardment rockets, the Rocket Research 
Project was reorganized as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source39"><SUP>39</A></SUP>
<P>In the 1920s and 1930s interest in rocketry and space exploration became 
firmly rooted in Europe, although the rapid expansion of aviation technology 
occupied the attention of most flight-minded Europeans. Societies of rocket 
theorists and experimenters, mostly privately sponsored, were established in 
several European countries.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source40"><SUP>40</A></SUP> 
The most important of these groups was the Society for Space Travel <I>(Verein 
für Raumschiffahrt),</I> founded in Germany but having members in other 
countries. The <I>"VfR,"</I> as its founders called it, gained much of its 
impetus from the writings of Oberth, who in 1923, as a young mathematician, 
published his classic treatise on space travel, <I>The Rocket into 
Interplanetary Space. </I>A substantial portion of this small book was devoted 
to a detailed description of the mechanics of putting into orbit a satellite of 
Earth.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source41"><SUP>4l</A></SUP>
<P>Spurred by Oberth's theoretical arguments, the Germans in the <I>VfR </I>in 
the early thirties conducted numerous static firings of rocket engines and 
launched a number of small rockets. Meanwhile the German Army, on the assumption 
that rocketry could become an extension of long-range artillery and because the 
construction of rockets was not prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles, had 
inaugurated a modest rocket development program in 1931, employing several of 
the <I>VfR</I> members. One of these was a 21-year-old engineer named Wernher 
von Braun, who later became the civilian head of the army's rocket research 
group. In 1933 the new Nazi regime placed all rocket experimentation, including 
that being done by the rest of the <I>VfR, </I>under strict government 
control.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source42"><SUP>42</A></SUP>
<P>The story of German achievements in military rocketry during the late 
thirties and early forties at Peenemuende, the vast military research 
installation on the Baltic Sea, is well known.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source43"><SUP>43</A></SUP> 
Knowing Goddard's work only through his published findings, the German 
experimenters contrived and elaborated on nearly all of the American's patented 
technical innovations, including gyroscopic controls, parachutes for rocket 
recovery, and movable deflector vanes in the exhaust. The rocket specialists at 
Peenemuende were trying to create the first large, long-range military rocket. 
By 1943, after numerous frustrations, they had their "big rocket," 46 feet long 
by 11½ feet in diameter, weighing 34,000 pounds when fueled, and producing 
69,100 pounds of thrust from a single engine consuming liquid oxygen and a 
mixture of alcohol and water. Called "Assembly-4" (A-4) by the Peenemuende 
group, the rocket had a range of nearly 200 miles and a maximum velocity of 
about 3,500 miles per hour, and was controlled by its [17] gyroscope and exhaust 
deflector vanes, sometimes supplemented by radio control.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source44"><SUP>44</A></SUP> 
When Major General Walter Dornberger, commander of the army works at 
Peenemuende, pronounced the A-4 operational in 1944, Joseph Goebbels' propaganda 
machine christened it <I>Vergeltungswaffe zwei </I>(Vengeance Weapon No. 2), or 
"V-2."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source45"><SUP>45</A></SUP> 
But for the space-travel devotees at Peenemuende the rocket remained the A-4, a 
step in the climb toward space.
<P>Although the total military effect of the 3,745 V-2s fired at targets on the 
Continent and in England was slight, this supersonic ballistic missile threw a 
long shadow over the future of human society. As the Western Allies and the 
Soviets swept into Germany, they both sought to confiscate the elements of the 
German rocket program in the form of records, hardware, and people. Peenemuende 
was within the Russian zone of occupation, but before the arrival of the Soviet 
forces von Braun and most of the other engineers and technicians fled westward 
with a portion of their technical data. The Americans also captured the 
underground V-2 factory in the Harz Mountains; 100 partially assembled V-2s were 
quickly dismantled and sent to the United States. Ultimately von Braun and about 
125 other German rocket specialists reached this country under "Project 
Paperclip," carried out by the United States Army.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source46"><SUP>46</A></SUP>
<P>The Soviets captured no more than a handful of top Peenemuende engineers and 
administrators. "This is absolutely intolerable," protested Josef Stalin to [18] 
Lieutenant Colonel G. A. Tokaty, one of his rocket experts. "We defeated the 
Nazi armies; we occupied Berlin and Peenemuende; but the Americans got the 
rocket engineers."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source47"><SUP>47</A></SUP> 
The Russians did obtain a windfall, however, in the form of hundreds of 
technicians and rank-and-file engineers, the Peenemuende laboratories and 
assembly plant, and lists of component suppliers. From those suppliers located 
in the Russian zone the Soviets secured enough parts to reactivate the 
manufacture of V-2s. The captured technicians and engineers were transported to 
the Soviet Union, where the Russian rocket specialists systematically drained 
them of the technical information they possessed but did not permit them to 
participate directly in the burgeoning postwar Soviet rocket development 
program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source48"><SUP>48</A></SUP>
<P>During the war Russian rocket developers, like their American counterparts, 
had concentrated on JATO and small bombardment rockets. "Backward though they 
were often said to be in matters of technology," observed James Phinney Baxter 
right after the war, "it was the Russians who in 1941 first employed rockets on 
a major scale. They achieved a notable success, and made more use of the rocket 
as a ground-to-ground weapon than any other combatant."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source49"><SUP>49</A></SUP> 
In the postwar years the Soviets quickly turned to the development of large 
liquid-propellant rockets. Lacking an armada of intercontinental bombers 
carrying atomic warheads, such as the United States possessed, they envisioned 
"trans-Atlantic rockets" as "an effective straightjacket for that noisy 
shopkeeper Harry Truman," to use Stalin's words.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm#source50"><SUP>50</A></SUP> 
Consequently the U.S.S.R. undertook to build a long-range military rocket years 
before nuclear weaponry actually became practicable for rockets; indeed, even 
before the Soviets had perfected an atomic device for delivery by aircraft.
<P>The U.S.S.R. began exploration of the upper atmosphere with captured V-2s in 
the fall of 1947. Within two years, however, Soviet production was underway on a 
single-stage rocket called the T-1, an improved version of the V-2. The first 
rocket divisions of the Soviet Armed Forces were instituted in 1950 or 1951. 
Probably in 1954, development work began on a multistage rocket to be used both 
as a weapon and as a vehicle for space exploration. And in the spring of 1956 
Communist Party Chairman Nikita Khrushchev warned that "soon" Russian rockets 
carrying thermonuclear warheads would be able to hit any target on Earth.<A

even ridiculed the idea that a rocket could ascend into space, because in a 
vacuum it would have nothing to "react against." See, for example, the lead 
editorial in <I>New York Times</I>, Jan. 13, 1920. The storm of embarrassing
