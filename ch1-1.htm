<P>[3]THE yearning of men to escape the confines of their Earth and to travel to 
the heavens is older than the history of mankind itself. Religion, mythology, 
and literature reaching back thousands of years are sprinkled with references to 
magic carpets, flying horses, flaming aerial chariots, and winged gods.<A

Although "science fiction" is a descriptive term of recent vintage, the 
fictional literature of space travel dates at least from the second century A.D. 
Around the year 160 the Greek savant Lucian of Samosata wrote satirically about 
an imaginary journey to the Moon, "a great countrie in the aire, like to a 
shining island," as Elizabethan scholars translated his description 1,500 years 
later. Carried to the Moon by a giant waterspout, Menippus, Lucian's hero, 
returns to Earth in an equally distinctive manner: The angry gods simply have 
Mercury take hold of his right ear and deposit him on the ground. Lucian 
established a tradition of space-travel fiction, and generations of later 
storytellers spawned numerous fantasies in which by some miraculous means - such 
as a flight of wild lunar swans in a seventeenth-century tale by Francis Godwin 
or a cannon shot in Jules Verne's classic account of a Moon voyage (1865-1870) - 
earthlings are transported beyond the confines of their world and into space.<A

<P>But apparently the first suggestion, fictional or otherwise, for an 
artificial manned satellite of Earth is to be found in a short novel called "The 
Brick Moon," written in 1869 by the American Edward Everett Hale and originally 
serialized in the <I>Atlantic Monthly.</I> Although, like most of his 
contemporaries, Hale had only a vague notion of where Earth's atmosphere ended 
and where space began, he did realize that somewhere the "aire" became the 
"aether," and he also understood the mechanics of putting a satellite into an 
Earth orbit:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If from the surface of the earth, by a gigantic peashooter, you 
  could shoot a pea upward . . .; if you drove it so fast and far that when its 
  power of ascent was exhausted, and it should fall, it should clear the earth . 
  . .; if you had given it sufficient power to get it half way round the earth 
  without touching, that pea would clear the earth forever. It would continue to 
  rotate . . . with the impulse with which it had first cleared our atmosphere 
  and attraction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[5]In Hale's story a group of industrious New Englanders construct a 
200-foot-diameter brick sphere, which, carrying 37 people, is prematurely hurled 
into an orbit 4,000 miles from Earth by two huge flywheels.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-1.htm#source3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> 
Less than a hundred years later, Hale's own country would undertake a more 
modest and more practicable scheme for a manned satellite in Project Mercury.

<P><CITE>The action of centripetal forces as advanced by Isaac Newton: "That by 
means of centripetal forces the planets may be retained in certain orbits, we 
may easily understand, if we consider the motions of projectiles; for a stone 
that is projected is by the pressure of its own weight forces out of the 
rectlinear path, which by the initial projection alone it should have pursued, 
and made to describe a curved line in the air; and through that crooked way is 
at last brought down to the ground; and the greater the velocity is with which 
it is projected, the farther it goes before it falls to the earth. We may 
therefore suppose the velocity to be so increased, that it would describe an arc 
of 1, 2, 5, 10, 100, 1,000 miles before it arrived at earth, till at last, 
exceeding the limits of the earth, it should pass into space without touching 
it."</CITE> 
<P>

<P>Centuries before Hale wrote about an orbiting manned sphere, Nicolaus 
Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, and other astronomers had helped 
put the solar system in order, with the Sun in the center and the various 
planets, spherical and of different sizes, orbiting elliptically around it. 
Isaac Newton had established the basic principles of gravitation and mechanics 
governing reaction propulsion and spatial navigation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-1.htm#source4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> 
Thus it was possible for Hale and his fellow-fictionists to think at least half 
seriously about, and to describe in fairly accurate detail, such adventures as 
orbiting Earth and its Moon and voyaging to Venus.
<P>Most flight enthusiasts in the nineteenth century, however, were absorbed 
with the problems of flight within the atmosphere, with conveyance from one 
place to another on Earth. This preoccupation with atmospheric transport, which 
would continue until the mid-twentieth century, in many ways retarded interest 
in rocketry and space travel. But the development and refinement of aeronautics 
in the twentieth century was both a product of and a stimulant to man's 
determination to fly ever higher and faster, to travel as far from his Earth as 
he could. Atmospheric flight, in terms of both motivation and technology, was a 
necessary prelude to the exploration of near and outer space. In a sense, 
therefore, man's journey along the highway to space, leading to such 
astronautical achievements as Project Mercury, began in the dense forest of his 
atmosphere, with feats in aeronautics.
