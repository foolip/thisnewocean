<H1>A Manned Satellite Plan</H1>The establishment of an organization to carry 
through a manned space flight program depended upon gaining the national 
decision to create a space agency and then upon defining the objectives of the 
space agency as a whole and of its highest priority programs in particular. In 
July 1958 legislative debate had ended in the passage of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Act. In August administrative power struggles had abated 
with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's appointments and Senate confirmation of 
the administrative heads of the new space agency. By September the technical and 
jurisdictional questions remaining to be solved for an operational manned 
satellite program had been removed from the open forum by their assignment to 
the Joint NASA-ARPA Manned Satellite Panel. When Glennan proclaimed that the 
demise of NACA and the birth of NASA would take effect at the close of business 
on September 30, 1958, there was reason to suppose that a preliminary 
organization of the nation's space program was well in hand. But in Washington 
there was no clear commitment to the precise size or priority of the manned 
program within NASA, because NASA itself was as yet only a congeries of 
transferred people, facilities, and projects.<A

<P>Earlier attempts to coordinate interservice and interagency plans and 
procedures for putting a man in space had been ineffectual. During the middle of 
September, Glennan and Roy W. Johnson, Director of Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (ARPA), had come to agree on the bare outline of a joint program for a 
manned orbital vehicle based on the ballistic capsule idea. A month earlier, 
Hugh L. Dryden, the veteran Director of the NACA, and Robert R. Gilruth, 
Assistant Director of Langley Aeronautical Research Laboratory, had informed 
Congressional committees of their plans for a manned capsule and had requested 
$30 million to proceed with the work. But only when the Joint Manned Satellite 
Panel was established by executive agreement between NASA and ARPA in 
mid-September 1958 did plans and proposals begin to jell into a positive course 
of action.<A

<P>Of the eight members of this steering committee, only two were from ARPA. Six 
had come from NACA and were the principal policy makers who laid down the 
guidelines and objectives for the first manned space flight program. This group 
began to meet almost continuously in late September in an effort to establish 
preliminary plans and schedules for the manned satellite project. Thousands of 
scientists and engineers over past years made possible their outline report, 
entitled "Objectives and Basic Plan for the Manned Satellite Project." But 
technical liaison between military and civilian groups on the immediate working 
levels provided the specific data for the outline drawn up by this panel: 
[111]<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-2.htm#source4"><SUP>4</A></SUP>
<P>
<DL>
  <DT>I. OBJECTIVES 
  <DD>The objectives of the project are to achieve at the earliest practicable 
  date orbital flight and successful recovery of a manned satellite, and to 
  investigate the capabilities of man in this environment. 
  <DT>II. MISSION 
  <DD>To accomplish these objectives, the most reliable available boost system 
  will be used. A nearly circular orbit will be established at an altitude 
  sufficiently high to permit a 24-hour satellite lifetime; however, the number 
  of orbital cycles is arbitrary. Descent from orbit will be initiated by the 
  application of retro-thrust. Parachutes will be deployed after the vehicle has 
  been slowed down by aerodynamic drag, and recovery on land or water will be 
  possible. 
  <DT>III. CONFIGURATION 
  <DD>
  <DL>
    <DT>A. <I>Vehicle</I> 
    <DD>The vehicle will be a ballistic capsule with high aerodynamic drag. It 
    should be statically stable over the mach number range corresponding to 
    flight within the atmosphere. Structurally, the capsule will be designed to 
    withstand any combination of acceleration, heat loads, and aerodynamic 
    forces that might occur during boost and reentry of successful or aborted 
    missions.</DD></DL></DD></DL>The document outlined generally the life support, 
attitude control, retrograde, recovery, and emergency systems and described the 
guidance and tracking, instrumentation, communications, ground support, and test 
program requirements.
<P>In only two and one-half pages of typescript, the "Objectives and Basic Plan" 
for the manned satellite were laid out for the concurrence of the Director of 
ARPA and the Administrator of NASA during the first week of October 1958. Verbal 
elucidations of accompanying charts, tables, and diagrams, plus scale models 
brought along from Langley Field, successfully sold this approach for putting 
man into orbit. Although the Air Force, Army, and Navy, as well as numerous 
aviation industry research teams, also had plans that might have worked equally 
well, the Nation could afford only one such program. The simplest, quickest, 
least risky, and most promising plan seemed to be this one.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-2.htm#source5"><SUP>5</A></SUP>
<P>The fact that the Joint Manned Satellite Panel was "loaded" six to two in 
favor of NASA reflected the White House decision that ARPA would assist NASA 
rather than comanage the project. The plans of the panel gave the appearance of 
unanimity among aeronautical engineers on how to accomplish manned orbital 
flight. Keith Glennan and Roy Johnson were impressed by this consensus but they 
refrained from making public their commitments for several more months. The 
tacit agreement among the panel members that no basic technical or scientific 
problems remained to be solved before moving into development and flight test 
would be tested by industrial response to the basic plan. If previous research 
had been sufficiently thorough to allow NASA to begin immediately applying 
engineering knowledge for the achievement of orbital flight, then the panel's 
judgment of [112] the state of the art should be confirmed by the aircraft 
companies. Only Alfred J. Eggers wished to be placed on record as favoring 
concurrent development of a lifting reentry vehicle.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-2.htm#source6"><SUP>6</A></SUP>
<P>The panel recommended three types of flight testing programs. First, 
development tests should verify the components of the manned satellite vehicle 
"to the point where they consistently and reliably perform satisfactorily, and 
provide design criteria by measuring loads, heating, and aerodynamic stability 
derivatives during critical portions of the flight." Second, qualification 
flight tests should determine suitability of the complete vehicle to perform its 
specified missions. Third, training and pilot performance flight tests should 
validate man's "potential for the specified missions." 
<BLOCKQUOTE>In this program, all three types of tests will be made with 
  full-scale articles. These tests will be initiated at low velocities, 
  altitudes and loads. They will progress with a buildup in severity of these 
  conditions until the maximum mission is reached. In general, development tests 
  will be completed, followed by qualification tests, and pilot performance and 
  training tests. However, there will be some overlap as the severity of 
  conditions are built up in the flight test program. The number and type of 
  pilot performance and training flights will be determined as the program 
  develops.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-2.htm#source7"><SUP>7</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>Although 
the conceptual design and the operating philosophy for the manned satellite 
program were remarkably firm at the time of authorization, specific technical 
difficulties in development could not be pinpointed in advance. The people who 
would have to solve them were only then being identified and appointed to their 
individual jobs. At NACA Headquarters in Washington, Hugh Dryden had presided 
during the summer over the metamorphosis of NACA into NASA. An established 
scientist and a proven technical executive, Dryden had been a logical choice if 
not for the Administrator, then for Deputy Administrator, the second highest 
position within the space agency. He must decide how many and who should move to 
Washington to manage the administrative side and to oversee the engineering 
work. What proportion of effort and funds should NASA spend on developing 
manned, as opposed to unmanned, spacecraft and rockets? On whom should the 
immediate responsibility for technical direction of the manned satellite program 
be put? Where should the locus for ground control of manned space flight 
operations be placed?
