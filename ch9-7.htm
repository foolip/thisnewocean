<H1>MR-1: The Four-Inch Flight</H1>November 21, 1960, marked the absolute nadir 
of morale among all the men at work on Project Mercury. That was the day the 
MR-1 countdown reached zero, and when "all we did was to launch the escape 
tower."
<P>Capsule No. 2 had been checked out at Huntsville on July 21 and shipped to 
the Cape the next day. The final standard trajectory was published on August 1, 
and the Redstone booster was delivered two days later. From July 23, when the 
capsule was airlifted to the Cape, until October 7, extensive internal reworking 
was required. Since this was the first complete capsule to be subjected to 
preflight checks, it was impossible to know precisely how long the checkout 
would take. Gleason of NASA Headquarters had explained these scheduling 
gymnastics to the Senate committee staff on November 3: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Between October 6 and October 31, 1960, the work proceeded 
  exceedingly well. By October 24, for example, first mate had been completed. 
  The rework had been accomplished and the simulated mission and servicing had 
  been carried out. Not only had none of the contingency period been used up, 
  but preparations were actually two days ahead of schedule! It was, therefore, 
  hoped for the first time, that the working level target date might actually be 
  met, assuming that some as yet unresolved electrical troubles would not cause 
  any real delays.
  <P>On October 31, the final mating of the capsule and booster was 
  accomplished. Still two days ahead of the target date established on October 
  7. Therefore, it became clear, upon examination of the remaining work, that 
  the launching might take place on November 7. Accordingly, the Project Mercury 
  operations director requested range clearance for November 7 and also 
  requested support by Naval recovery forces for this date.
  <P>Because of the continuing great urgency of Project Mercury, and because 
  each succeeding launching hinges critically on the dates of previous 
  launchings, the selection of November 7 as a launch date for MR-1 was the only 
  possible [294] course of action to take for the operations director. In making 
  this decision, he recognized that he was merely identifying the earliest 
  possible launch date, and that this date might well be delayed if difficulties 
  were to be encountered during the final checkout, or if bad weather was 
  encountered. A later decision, on the other hand, would have been inexcusable 
  for this might have caused unnecessary delays if all went well during the 
  final checkout period.<A

was on the launch table on November 7, 1960, when the helium pressure dropped 
from 2,250 pounds per square inch to 500 pounds in the capsule control system, 
and the mission was scrubbed again. The capsule was removed from its booster and 
the heat shield was removed from the capsule so that a helium relief valve and 
the toroidal hydrogen peroxide tank could be replaced. A wiring change was made 
to avoid a failure of the Little Joe variety, and electrical sequence checks 
were redone as reassembly proceeded. Then, on November 21, MR-1 was reassembled 
and the final countdown proceeded normally, with the exception of a one-hour 
hold to fix another leak in the capsule's hydrogen peroxide system. The Mercury 
Control Center was manned for the first time. At 9 a.m. Redstone ignition 
occurred precisely as scheduled.
<P>The expected blast momentarily churned the air around launch complex No. 56. 
But then the roar stopped as suddenly as it had started. Watching by periscope 
from the blockhouse, the startled engineers saw the booster wobble slightly on 
its pedestal and settle back on its fins after, at the very most, a four- or 
five-inch liftoff. The Rocketdyne A-7 engine shut down, and the escape pylon 
zipped up 4,000 feet and landed about 400 yards away from the launch site. Three 
seconds after the escape rocket blew, the drogue package shot upward, and then 
the main chute spurted out of the top of the capsule followed by the reserve 
parachute, and both fluttered down alongside the Redstone.
<P>Mercury-Redstone 1 was the most distressing, not to say embarrassing, failure 
so far in Project Mercury. Critics waxed unrestrained. Even the Redstone experts 
seemed disconcerted.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-7.htm#source73"><SUP>73</SUP></A> 
Technically it seemed inexplicable that the normal, instead of the abort 
ejection, sequence had followed engine shutdown. George Low later that day 
carried STG's report to the NASA Headquarters staff on what they thought had 
happened: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Apparently, sufficient thrust had developed to lift the booster at 
  least 3/32 inch, thereby activating all the systems. (This would require more 
  than 85% of nominal thrust.) The booster settled back down on the pad, 
  damaging the tail fins, and perhaps the structure as well (some wrinkles are 
  visible in the shell). The reason for this shutdown is unknown - the only 
  shutdown to the booster could have come from the booster programmer, at the 
  end of the normal flight sequence. Just how this programmer malfunctioned 
  cannot be determined without a detailed inspection.
  <P>The capsule sequence . . . was a normal one for the type of signal it 
  received. A closed-loop abort sensing system would have given an abort signal 
  under the conditions of this launching, carrying the capsule away in a regular 
  off-the-pad abort sequence.
  <P>At the time of this writing, the booster destruct system is still armed, 
  and [295] cannot be disarmed until the battery depletion during the morning of 
  November 22. Capsule pyrotechnics (including posigrade and retrograde rocket) 
  are also armed. The problem is further complicated by the fact that the main 
  parachute is still hanging from the capsule; thus the booster could be blown 
  over in a high- wind condition. Weather predictions, however, are good. It is 
  planned to put the gantry around the booster in the morning, under the 
  assumption that the Redstone has not shifted sufficiently to make this 
  impossible. This will be followed by booster and capsule disarming and 
  sequence checks to determine the cause of the failure.
  <P>The extent of damage to the capsule has not yet been assessed. Assuming a 
  minimum of damage, it is planned to use the same capsule, together with the 
  MR-3 booster, for the MR- 1 firing. It will probably take a month before this 
  launching can take place.<A

The day after the MR-1 attempt, Walter Burke of McDonnell volunteered to lead a 
squad of men to disarm the pyrotechnics and umbilical cable still hanging fire. 
Two days later, after intensive on-the-scene investigations of the puzzle 
presented by MR-1, Low reported a better consensus of expert opinion: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The MR-1 failure is now believed to have been caused by a booster 
  tail plug which is pulled out about one inch after liftoff.
  <P>It has been determined that this two-prong plug is designed so that one 
  prong disconnects about one-half inch before the second one does. This time 
  interval between disconnect of the first and second prongs for MR-1 was 21 
  milliseconds.
  <P>The booster circuitry is such that if one of these prongs is disconnected 
  prior to the other and while the booster is not grounded, a relay will close 
  giving a normal engine cutoff signal. The time interval between successive 
  disconnects was apparently just sufficient to allow the relay to close.
  <P>It is reasoned that Redstone missiles are somewhat lighter than the Mercury 
  Redstone (with its extended tank), thereby giving higher initial acceleration 
  and shorter time intervals between disconnects between the two prongs. This 
  shorter time interval would be sufficient to allow the relay to close, thus 
  having avoided this type of failure in the past.
  <P>This relay behavior could not be detected during checkout procedures since 
  it will only occur when the booster is not grounded.
  <P>The above theory of failure was advanced by Marshall personnel at Cape 
  Canaveral and has not been confirmed by Marshall-Huntsville. It is planned to 
  continue tests at Huntsville using the Mercury-Redstone No. 2 booster to 
  verify this hypothesis.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-7.htm#source75"><SUP>75</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Within 
a week, MR-1 was rescheduled for December 19, and MR-2 and MR-3 had been 
postponed until 1961. Low informed Silverstein that "The MR-1 capsule will be 
used as is, together with the escape tower from Capsule 8, and the antenna 
fairing from Capsule 10. The MR-3 booster will be used for this shot."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-7.htm#source76"><SUP>76</SUP></A> 
There was no longer any question that the mating of booster and spacecraft 
should be done at the Cape.
<P>Physicists observing MR-1 might have expected someone among the 5,000 members 
of the Marshall Center to have guarded against the relativity of simultaneity 
where electrical signals were concerned, but McDonnell and Task Group engineers 
dared not taunt their fellow workers on the Redstone about the cause of the 
"four-inch flight" of MR-1. They were happy that the sequence system on the 
capsule performed perfectly, but they too felt responsible for the failure of 
the MR-1 capsule to abort. Meanwhile Joachim P. Kuettner and Earl Butler at 
Huntsville, and Kurt Debus and Emil P. Bertram at the Cape, frantically drove 
the men of their respective Redstone-Mercury Office and Launch Operations 
Directorate to hasten preparations for MR-1A. By mid-December 1960, the Redstone 
team assured Washington that the repeat flight was almost ready: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The November 21 type event will be avoided, in the future, by the 
  addition of a ground cable sufficiently long to maintain a good ground 
  connection until all umbilical plugs are pulled. In addition, the booster 
  circuitry has been [297] modified so that a cutoff signal can only get to the 
  capsule after 130 seconds of booster thrust (normal cutoff occurs at 140 
  seconds). Before that time, the capsule can only be released from the booster 
  through an abort signal, manually given from the ground.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-7.htm#source77"><SUP>77</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Minor 
additional improvements were made to the capsule systems, a revised master 
operational schedule was issued, the Mercury ground control operations team was 
brought up to full strength, and Jerome Hammack, STG's Redstone project 
engineer, along with Paul C. Donnelly, the Mercury-Redstone test conductor in 
the blockhouse, worried through each day, hour, and minute before December 19.
