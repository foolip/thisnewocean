<H1>Atlas-Mercury One: A Complete Failure</H1>Late in February 1960 the Air 
Force Ballistic Missile Division (BMD) and Space Technology Laboratories (STL) 
had been hosts for a meeting in Los Angeles of people from Convair/Astronautics, 
McDonnell, and the Task Group who were to determine the final details of the 
ultimate booster- capsule system for Project Mercury. Already STG had decided 
unilaterally, as was its prerogative, to make the next shot split the difference 
between the Big Joe development mission and a full qualification flight test of 
the Mercury-Atlas configuration on a simulated reentry from orbit. To the Task 
Group, this configuration and mission had long since been known as "MA-1 ," but 
Air Force and Convair engineers usually transposed the names and spoke of 
"Atlas-Mercury" No. 1. As in many other particulars, which things should be 
first still was debatable. Maxime A. Faget recorded his impression of the 
central technical debate at the Mercury-Atlas meeting on February 26: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>STL/CVA representatives made an impassioned plea to use the escape 
  tower on the MA-1 shot. Only with the escape tower on, can the Atlas people 
  [273] determine the structural bending modes on the Atlas and, consequently, 
  the adequacy of their control system to accommodate them. The writer explained 
  that the tower was deleted from this flight only after a great deal of 
  deliberation at the Space Task Group, that much water has gone over the dam 
  since then, and to change now would be very difficult. Although I agreed to 
  take back to the Space Task Group management their desires for further 
  consideration, they were informed that there was virtually no chance that the 
  change would be made.<A

the MA-1 launch date approached, the Langley outfitters of the Big Joe capsule 
installed inside the shell of McDonnell's capsule No. 4 another instrumentation 
package, built by Lewis Research Center and STG electronics technicians. Shipped 
to the Cape in mid-May, loaded with 200 pounds of sensing instruments - 
including two cameras, two tape recorders, and a 16-channel telemetry system - 
the MA-1 payload was equipped to measure some 50 temperatures (mostly on the 
afterbody); pitch, yaw, and roll rates; positive and negative accelerations; 
cabin and external pressures; and noise and vibration extremes. Besides the 
missing 1,060- pound escape system, this payload also lacked the environmental 
control system, the astronaut couch and control panel, and the attitude-control 
and stabilization-control jets. An inert paste replaced the solid fuel in the 
retrorockets. For several months before the Atlas 50-D booster arrived at the 
Cape, Joseph M. Bobik, of the STG Launch Operations Branch, had work abundant as 
the inspector of the MA-1 capsule. Meanwhile Sigurd A. Sjoberg, John D. Hodge, 
Richard G. Arbic, John P. Mayer, and Robert E. McKann were hastily revising the 
mission directive, data acquisition plan, and general information on recovery 
requirements, landing area predictions, and a summary of calculated preflight 
trajectory data.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> 
Robert F. Thompson, Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., and Charles W. Mathews listed in 
order of importance the test objectives of the MA-1 flight: 
<OL>
  <LI>Recover the capsule. 
  <LI>Determine the structural integrity of the Mercury capsule structure and 
  afterbody shingles under the maximum heating conditions which could be 
  encountered from an orbital launching. 
  <LI>Determine Mercury capsule afterbody heating rates during reentry (for this 
  purpose 51 thermocouples were installed). 
  <LI>Determine the flight dynamic characteristics of the Mercury capsule during 
  reentry. 
  <LI>Determine the adequacy of the Mercury capsule recovery systems. 
  <LI>Familiarize Project Mercury operating personnel with launch and recovery 
  operations.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source27"><SUP>27</SUP></A></LI></OL>When 
capsule No. 4 actually arrived at Cape Canaveral on May 23, it was as complete 
as it was supposed to be except for flight instrumentation, parachutes, and 
pyrotechnic devices. Following a satisfactory test of the leakage rate of its 
[274] pressure shell, the capsule's miles of wiring were verified while the 
instrumentation system was subjected to final bench tests. Minor difficulties 
with instruments and in using a new weight-and-balance fixture added two weeks 
to the work period. For integrated systems tests to verify the sequencing and 
monitoring during the reentry, the capsule was moved into the newly constructed 
clean room in Hangar S.
<P>When every minor discrepancy had been corrected and the calibration curves 
for various units had been established, the spacecraft was moved out to launch 
complex 14 for the first mechanical mating of a Mercury capsule with an Atlas 
booster. The alignment was good; no rework was required for the umbilicals or 
for the complex wiring in blockhouse consoles. But mechanical problems with 
Freon lines and with some electrical contacts in the mating ring caused a delay. 
Taken back to Hangar S for dismantling to rework certain instrumentation and 
telemetry packages, the capsule again was transported to the pad and mated to 
the launch vehicle in preparation for the flight acceptance composite test, 
known by its acronym, FACT. From July 13 to 18 engineers stood on the bascule of 
the gantry, working to conclude the FACT satisfactorily.
<P>Meanwhile the Atlas crews were checking out their vehicle. Friendly rivalry 
between the propulsion and payload people produced many wagers over which system 
would cause the next postponement, and whether the capsule or the booster would 
be first to report "all systems go." On July 21, the flight readiness firing, 
which was a dress-rehearsal static-firing test, tested the three Atlas engines 
and measured the vibrations and acceleration strains suffered by the capsule. 
Atlas partisans won a bet at this point; atop this particular capsule the short 
metal legs of the "stub tower" created some unique antenna and telemetry 
difficulties with power amplifiers, commutators, and a high voltage standing 
wave ratio. The purpose of the "stub tower" was to support a thermal fairing 
over the antenna and parachute canister. Again the spacecraft was returned to 
the hangar. The tape recorders and cameras were removed, reloaded, and 
reinstalled. The telemetry was checked. The recovery section equipment was 
removed, then reassembled with live pyrotechnics. The capsule again was 
balanced, weighed, and aligned optically before its final union with the 
booster.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>McDonnell's virgin spacecraft No. 4 moved to the seaside launch pad dressed 
in a polyethylene raincoat on July 24. This time it nestled nicely on top the 
Atlas, and the umbilical insertion and pull tests shortly certified readiness to 
begin the countdown. Wet weather made it difficult to keep the pyrotechnic 
connections dry, but otherwise preflight checkouts were completed on July 26, 
1960. For the benefit of Administrator Glennan, George Low summarized the 
expectations for Mercury-Atlas 1:<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>The primary objective of this test is to determine the integrity 
  of the Mercury capsule structure and afterbody shingles when subjected to the 
  maximum heating conditions which could be encountered in any Mercury mission.
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Maximum velocity: 19,000 feet per second 
    <LI>Maximum altitude: 98 nautical miles 
    <LI>Range: 1,300 nautical miles 
    <LI>Peak deceleration: 16.3 g 
    <LI>Time of flight: 16 minutes</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>[275] Heavy rain pelted the 
Cape early on Friday morning, July 29, 1960, but the cloud ceiling rose high 
enough to be considered acceptable for a launching. During the final 35 minutes 
of countdown before launch time (T), 48 minutes were accumulated by delays or 
"holds" because of bad weather; liquid oxygen tank-topping delays; and telemetry 
receiver difficulties. In the blockhouse Gilruth and Walter Burke watched Walter 
Williams direct operations and Aleck C. Bond, the project engineer, sweat away 
the minutes, while across the Cape at Central Control, other Air Force, Navy, 
and Convair officers and officials also watched and waited. Before their 
consoles in the blockhouse sat the Convair test conductors Kurt Johnston and 
William Williams; Scott H. Simpkinson, the payload test conductor; Harold G. 
Johnston, the ground instrumentation coordinator; Jacob Moser, the 
instrumentation engineer; B. Porter Brown, the launch coordinator; Richard 
Arbic, the range coordinator; and Donald C. Cheatham, the recovery coordinator. 
At 7:25 the weather looked cooperative in the impact area, where recovery 
aircraft and ships were reporting a visibility of five miles and a sea state of 
mild swells. So the gantry was ordered to back away, leaving MA-1 poised alone 
in the rain, ready for the final count. Intermittent holds for minor status 
checks left only 7 minutes of count at 9 o'clock.
<P>Finally at 9:13 the man-made thunder clapped as the Rocketdyne engines spewed 
forth their reaction energy. The noise grew louder for several seconds as the 
Atlas pushed itself up on its fiery blast by inches, feet, and yards. Out of 
sight in seconds as it pierced the cloud cover, Atlas 50-D could still be heard 
roaring off in the distance. The initial phases of the launching appeared to be 
normal. Then everything went wrong: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>About one minute after liftoff all contact with the Atlas was 
  lost. This included telemetry and all beacons and transponders. About one 
  second before telemetry was lost, the pressure difference between the lox and 
  fuel tanks suddenly went to zero. It is not known whether this caused the 
  failure or was an effect of the failure. There was no progression of unusual 
  events leading up to this pressure loss. During the remaining second of 
  telemetry, the Atlas flight path appeared to be steady.</BLOCKQUOTE>By telephone 
and teletype data links, Low in Washington pieced together the bad news on MA-1 
and continued to dictate an immediate preliminary report for the administrator 
and his staff: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>As you know, the abort sensing system was flown open loop in this 
  test. This system gave two signals to abort, apparently about the same time as 
  the tank pressure differential was lost. These signals were monitoring missile 
  electrical power and thrust; although the tank pressure differential was also 
  monitored, no abort signal was received from this source. In the MA-1 mission, 
  all of these signals were merely monitored, and were not connected to any of 
  the capsule systems.
  <P>[276] The current speculation is that the Atlas either exploded, or 
  suffered a catastrophic structural failure. Some observers reported that they 
  heard an explosion, but this is not verified. The failure occurred at the time 
  of maximum dynamic pressure, at an altitude of about 32,000 feet, and a 
  velocity of about 1,400 feet per second.
  <P>The capsule separation systems were not to be armed until about three 
  minutes after launch, and therefore the capsule remained attached to the Atlas 
  or to pieces of the Atlas, until impact. Capsule telemetry continued to impact 
  and indicated violent motions after the Atlas telemetry ceased. Temperatures 
  and shingle vibrations flutter were recorded. Since all shingle thermocouples 
  gave readings to splash, it is inferred that none of the shingles tore off. 
  Impact occurred about seven miles off shore in an area where the water depth 
  is roughly 40 feet. At the time of this writing, ships were still searching 
  for debris.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source30"><SUP>30</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>It 
was a sad day for Mercury. It was especially frustrating for those nearest to 
the Atlas-Mercury phase, for they knew only that MA-1, either Atlas 50-D or 
capsule No. 4, or both, exploded on its way through max q. They did not know 
precisely what had happened because the weather had been so bad as to prevent 
visual and photographic coverage. In Washington, at Langley, at the Cape, and in 
southern California, postmortems were held for two weeks, until a conference on 
August 11 marshalled the parties most interested in the MA-1 malfunction, along 
with all the flight records, telemetry, and tape recorder data. Salvage 
operations had been able to recover only small portions of the capsule, the 
adapter-ring, and the booster. Presiding at this meeting was Major General 
Leighton I. Davis, the new commander of the Air Force Missile Test Center, who 
had relieved Major General Donald N. Yates in June as the Department of Defense 
single-point-of–contact for support of Project Mercury. On August 22, Warren J. 
North summarized the "quick-look" opinions of NASA and STL but not of 
Convair/Astronautics: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Both the NASA and STG localized the difficulty within the 
  interface area between the capsule and the booster. A metallurgist from STL 
  explained that it appeared the plumbing to the Atlas lox boiloff valve had 
  failed due to fatigue. One would not ordinarily suspect a fatigue failure 
  after such a short period of time, however, the NASA analysis showed that the 
  lox valve plumbing could have failed if a 30 g oscillation existed at 
  approximately 300 cycles per second. Culbertson (Convair) admitted that the 
  lox valve was poorly supported and that 30 g was a feasible magnitude of 
  acceleration. Vibration measurements show a two and one-half g vibration of 
  the booster airframe, consequently a 12 g amplification factor would have been 
  required at the lox valve.
  <P>Jim Chamberlin, STG, has been appointed chairman of a joint committee to 
  resolve the MA-1 incident and provide a fix prior to MA-2. Initial reaction of 
  this committee would cause the establishment of a hardware mockup at McDonnell 
  which would include the pressurized lox tank dome, lox valve, adapter, and 
  capsule. This mockup will be vibrated in order to isolate resonance or 
  amplification factors.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source31"><SUP>31</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>[278] 
Two weeks later in San Diego, another committee of nine metallurgical engineers, 
a majority of whom were not from Convair, examined microscopically the 
hypothesis that MA-1 was destroyed by metal fatigue of the lox-vent valve elbow. 
"All conferees agreed finally that the factor at hand was not the primary 
one."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> 
The official flight test report issued two months later concluded with these 
remarks: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Mercury Atlas No. 1 flight test was abruptly terminated 
  approximately 58.5 seconds after launch by an in- flight failure of an 
  undetermined nature. Solid cloud cover at the time of launch precluded the use 
  of optical records in the investigation of this failure. The following 
  conclusions are drawn regarding this flight test:
  <P>
  <OL>
    <LI>None of the primary capsule test objectives were met. 
    <LI>The structural integrity of the capsule was maintained throughout the 
    flight until impact with the water. A substantial part of the adapter 
    remained attached to the capsule to impact. 
    <LI>The capsule onboard instrumentation performed in a highly satisfactory 
    manner throughout the flight. 
    <LI>The onboard instrumentation showed the presence of shingle vibration of 
    a non-destructive nature. 
    <LI>All Department of Defense support for the operation was very good.<A 
    href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source33"><SUP>33</SUP></A></LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>In 
mid-September one of the most important of the regular monthly meetings of the 
Mercury-Atlas coordination panel took place in the administration building at 
Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Brundin, Major 
Charles L. Gandy, and Captain I. B. Hanson were the BMD representatives, while 
Philip E. Culbertson and C. J. Holden represented Convair. Bernard A. Hohmann 
and Ernst R. Letsch were representing Aerospace Corporation, since STL was 
phasing out of Mercury. John Yardley, R. L. Foster, and J. T. Heard were present 
for McDonnell.
<P>First and last on the agenda of this meeting were questions concerning better 
ways of inspecting and solving problems at the interface between the capsule and 
the booster. Charles Mathews, the chairman, began the meeting by insisting that 
in spite of the MA-1 failure, the overall Mercury-Atlas schedule could still be 
maintained. Hohmann suggested that a new seven- man joint capsule-booster 
interface inspection committee be established. This was done, and members 
representing all contributing organizations were named. Regarding the unsettled 
question of MA-1, Mathews briefly described several fruitless fact-finding 
activities and the need for additional instrumentation to determine the cause of 
failures like MA-1. No new hypothesis had yet emerged from the several test 
programs, so the 23 members of this coordination panel reexamined each other's 
previous answers to the enigma of MA- 1. The 11 members from STG vetoed a 
proposal by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division to establish still another 
"Mercury-Atlas interface panel."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>Although the MA-1 investigation was unsatisfying, the launch operations 
committee reported that MA-2 was so nearly ready for a November launching that 
[279] there was little time for looking backward and no time for regret. Then on 
September 26, 1960, a lunar probe attempt by NASA, using Atlas Able 5-A, also 
failed severely. This forced a wholesale review of the Atlas as a launch 
vehicle. Everybody responsible for MA-1 was trying to determine the cause of 
that failure, but each only discovered that there were too many other bodies, 
both organic and organizational, partly responsible.
<P>Late in October, before the national elections and before another Mercury 
flight test had come to pass, Gilruth and Williams held another periodic press 
conference for the benefit of curious reporters. Inevitably the question was 
asked, "Are you satisfied that you have pinpointed the reason for the MA-1 
failure?" "No," Gilruth answered. "We successfully salvaged the capsule and can 
account for all parts." His interrogator continued, "Do you believe that parts 
in the Atlas' upper stage caused the failure?" Gilruth replied, "We have 
explored this. We have answered all of the questions we have asked ourselves - 
but have we asked the right questions? We can't be sure. That is one of the 
reasons we are repeating the test. And on MA-2 the interface area will be 
heavily instrumented."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-3.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>When MA-2 finally became ready for launch, toward the end of February 1961, 
the managers of Mercury knew that a repetition of a total failure like MA-1 
could easily cause abandonment of the project. The entire promise of the 
American manned space flight program seemed to hang in the balance. The 
technical aftermath of MA-1, during the politically sensitive period of the 
Presidential election and the lame-duck session of Congress, made interrelated 
technical and political considerations more acute than ever. To distinguish 
between the two soon became virtually impossible.
