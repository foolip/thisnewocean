<H1>Approaches to Reliability</H1>"Reliability" was a slippery word, connoting 
more than it denoted. Yet as an engineering concept it had basic utility and a 
recognized place in both aviation and missile technology. The quest for some 
means of predicting failures and thereby raising the odds toward success began 
modestly as a conscious effort among STG and McDonnell engineers only in 
mid-1959, after design and development work on major systems was well under way. 
Other engineering groups working in support of Project Mercury also began rather 
late to take special care to stimulate quality control and formal reliability 
programs for booster and capsule systems. Mercury would never have been 
undertaken in the first place if the general "state-of-the-art" had not been 
considered ready, but mathematical analyses of the word "reliability" both 
clarified its operational meaning and stirred resistance to the statistical 
approach to quality control.
<P>The fifties had witnessed a remarkable growth in the application of 
statistical quality control to ensure the reliability of weapon systems and 
automatic machinery. The science of operations analysis and the art of quality 
management had emerged by the end of the decade as special vocations. 
Administrator Glennan himself, as president of Case Institute of Technology, had 
encouraged the development over the decade of one of the nation's foremost 
centers for operations [179] research at Case.<A

STG executive engineers studied an almost pedestrian example of these new 
methods for more scientific management of efficiency; it was one given by an 
automobile executive who compared the reliability of his corporation's product 
over 32 years before 1959: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the parts going into the 1959 car were of the same quality 
  level as those that went into the 1927 car, chances would be even that the 
  current model would not run.
  <P>This does not mean that the 1927 car was no good. On the contrary, its 
  quality was excellent for that time. But it was a relatively simple product, 
  containing only 232 critical parts. The 1959 car has 688 such parts. The more 
  the critical parts, the higher the quality level of each individual part must 
  be if the end product is to be reliable.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source22"><SUP>22</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>In 
view of the fact that estimates showed over 40,000 critical parts in the Atlas 
and 40,000 more in the capsule, the awesome scale and scope of a reliability 
program for Mercury made it difficult to decide where to begin.
<P>To organize engineering design information and data on component performance, 
someone had first to classify, name, or define the "critical parts." To create 
interrelated systems and to analyze them as separate entities at the same time 
was difficult. The Space Task Group and McDonnell worked on creation at the 
expense of analysis through 1959. Gradually NASA Headquarters and Air Force 
systems engineers steered attention to certain "semantic" problems in the 
primitive concepts being used for reliability analyses. For instance, what 
constitutes a "system"? How should one define "failure"? What indices or 
coefficients best "measure" overall system performance from subsystem data?<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
<P>These and other features of reliability prediction were so distasteful to 
creative engineers that many seriously questioned the validity and even the 
reliability of reliability predictions. "Reliability engineering," admitted one 
apologist in this field, "may seem to be more mysticism and black art than it is 
down-to-earth engineering. In particular, many engineers look on reliability 
prediction as a kind of space-age astrology in which failure rate tables have 
been substituted for the zodiac."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> 
Around STG this skeptical attitude was fairly representative. But at NASA 
Headquarters, Richard E. Horner, newly arrived in June 1959 as Associate 
Administrator and third man in command, had brought in a small staff of 
mathematicians and statisticians. It was led by Nicholas E. Golovin, who 
transferred from the Air Force to NASA some of the mathematical techniques 
lending quantitative support to demands for qualitative assurance. 
Theory-in-Washington versus practice-at-Langley were in conflict for a year 
until the nature of "reliability" for pilot safety on the one hand and for 
mission success on the other became more clearly understood by both parties. The 
pressure exerted by Golovin and NASA Headquarters to get the Task Group and 
McDonnell to change its approach to raising reliability levels became a 
significant feature in redesign and reliability testing during 1960.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
<P>Scientists, statisticians, and actuaries, working with large populations of 
[180] entities or events, had long been able to achieve excellent predicitions 
by defining reliability as probability, but in so doing they sacrificed any 
claim to know what would happen in a unique instance. Engineers and managers 
responsible for a specific mission or project tended to ridicule probability 
theory and to call it invidiously "the numbers game." Being limited to a small 
set of events and forced by time to overlap design, development, test, and 
operations phases, they could not accept the statistical viewpoint. They 
demanded that reliability be redefined as an ability. The senior statistician at 
Space Technology Laboratories for the Atlas weapon system, Harry Powell, 
recognized and elaborated on this distinction while his colleagues became 
involved with man-rating the Atlas. His remarks indicated the STL and 
Convair/Astronautics faced the same divergence of opinion that NASA Headquarters 
and STG confronted: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>If reliability is to be truly understood and controlled, then it 
  must be thought of as a device a physical property which behaves in accordance 
  with certain physical laws. In order to insure that a device will have these 
  physical properties it is necessary to consider it first as a design 
  parameter. In other words, reliability is a property of the equipment which 
  must be designed into the equipment by the engineers. <I>Reliability cannot be 
  tested into a device and it cannot be inspected into a device; it can only be 
  achieved if it is first designed into a device.</I> Most design engineers are 
  acutely aware that they are under several obligations - to meet schedules, to 
  design their equipment with certain space and weight limitations, and to 
  create a black box (a subsystem) which will give certain outputs when certain 
  inputs are fed into it. It is imperative that they also be aware of their 
  obligation to design a device which will in fact perform its required function 
  under operation conditions whenever it is called upon to do so.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source26"><SUP>26</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>There 
is a rule in probability theory that the reliability of a system is exactly 
equal to the product of the reliability of each of its subsystems in series. The 
obvious way to obviate untrustworthy black boxes was to connect two black boxes 
in parallel to perform the same function. In other words, redundancy was the 
technique most often used to ensure reliability.
<P>After the cancellation of Mercury-Jupiter, Kuettner and others at ABMA set 
about a serious effort to develop a parachute system to recover the Redstone 
booster. They also began to concentrate on the simplifications necessary for the 
sake of reliability to custom-build a man-rated Redstone. Starting with the 
advanced, elongated version of the rocket, which had been renamed the 
"Jupiter-C" in 1956 for the Army's ablation research on reentry test vehicles, 
Kuettner called upon the expertise of all who could spare time from the Saturn 
program to help decide how to man-rate their stock. The fundamental change made 
to the Jupiter-C airframe was the elimination of its staging capability. Other 
modifications stripped it of its more sophisticated components while permitting 
it to retain greater performance characteristics than the original single-stage 
Redstone.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
<P>The designers of the Redstone and Jupiter missile systems proposed an 
extensive list of basic modifications to adapt the vehicle to the Mercury 
capsule. [181] The elongated fuel tanks of the Jupiter-C had to be retained for 
20 extra seconds of engine burning time, especially since they decided to revert 
to alcohol for fuel rather than use the more powerful but more toxic hydyne that 
fueled the Jupiter-C. Another high-pressure nitrogen tank to pressurize the 
larger fuel tank and an auxiliary hydrogen peroxide fuel tank to power the 
engine turbopump also had to be added. To increase the reliability of the 
advanced Redstone, they had to simplify other parts of the Jupiter-C system. 
Instead of the sophisticated autopilot called ST-80, one of the first inertial 
guidance systems (the LEV-3 ) was reinstalled as the guidance mechanism. The 
after unit of the payload on the old Redstone, which had contained a pressurized 
instrument compartment, became the permanent forebody of the main tank assembly, 
there being no need to provide terminal guidance for the new payload. A 
spacecraft adapter ring likewise had to be designed to simplify interface 
coordination and to ensure clean separation between capsule and booster. At the 
other end of the launch vehicle it was necessary to use the most recent engine 
model, the A-7, to avoid a possible shortage of spare parts. Hans G. Paul and 
William E. Davidson, ABMA propulsion engineers, took the basic responsibility 
for "manrating" this engine.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>Although STG engineers bought the Redstone in the first place because it was 
considered an "off-the-shelf" rocket, they gradually learned through Hammack's 
liaison with Butler that the Mercury-Redstone was in danger of being modified in 
about 800 particulars, enough to vitiate the record of reliability established 
by the earlier Redstones and Jupiter-Cs. Too much redesign also meant reopening 
the Pandora's box of engineering "trade-offs," the compromises between 
overdesign and underdesign. Von Braun's team tended in the former direction; 
Gilruth's in the latter. To use Kuettner's distinction, ABMA wanted "positive 
redundancy" to ensure aborts whenever required, whereas STG wanted more 
"negative redundancy" to avoid aborts unless absolutely essential.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> 
This distinction was the crux of the dispute and the essence of the distinction 
between "pilot safety" and "mission success."
<P>On July 22, 1959, STG engineers received a group of reliability experts from 
von Braun's Development Operations Division at Huntsville. Three decades of 
rocket experience had ingrained strongly held views among the 100 or so leaders 
of this organization about how to ensure successful missions. The ABMA 
representatives told STG that they did not play the "numbers game" but attacked 
reliability from an exhaustive engineering test viewpoint. Their experience had 
proved the adequacy of their own reliability program, carried out by a separate 
working group on a level with other engineering groups and staffed by persons 
from all departments in the Development Operations Division of ABMA. In 
conference with design engineers, ABMA reliability experts normally set up test 
specifications and environmental requirements for proving equipment compliance. 
STG felt sympathetic to this approach to reliability, but systems analysts at 
NASA Headquarters did not.
<P>[182] As for the prime contractor's reliability program, in the first major 
textbook studied by the astronauts, McDonnell's "Project Mercury Indoctrination" 
manual, distributed in May 1959, the pilots read these reassuring words: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The problem of attaining a high degree of reliability for Project 
  Mercury has received more attention than has any other previous missile or 
  aircraft system. Reliability has been a primary design parameter since the 
  inception of the project.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source30"><SUP>30</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Accompanying 
reliability diagrams showed over 60 separate redundancies designed into the 
various capsule systems, allowing alternate pilot actions in the event of 
equipment malfunctions during an orbital mission.
<P>McDonnell specified three salient features of its reliability program in this 
preliminary indoctrination manual. First, by making reliability a design 
requirement and by allowing no more than a permissible number of failures before 
redesign and retesting were required, reliability was made a conscious goal from 
the beginning of manufacture. Second, five separate procedures were to implement 
the development program: evaluations, stress analyses, design reviews, failure 
reporting, and failure analysis. Third, reliability would be demonstrated 
finally by both qualification and reliability testing.
<P>These assurances did not seem adequate; STG, as well as NASA-Washington, 
requested McDonnell to clarify its reliability policy in more detail and to hold 
a new symposium in mid-August to prove the claim that "reliability is 
everybody's business at McDonnell." McDonnell responded by changing its "design 
objective" approach to what may be called a "development objective" approach. 
The new program, drawn by Walter A. Harman and Eugene A. Kunznick, explicitly 
set forth mean times to failure and added more exhaustive demonstrations, or 
"life tests," for certain critical components. More fundamental assumptions were 
made explicit, such as: "the reliability of the crew is one (1.0)," and "the 
probability of a catastrophic explosion of the booster, of any of the rockets, 
of the reaction control system, or of the environmental control system is 
negligible."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> 
McDonnell's presentation at this symposium stressed new quality control 
procedures and effectively satisfied STG for the moment. Golovin and his NASA 
Headquarters statisticians were pleased to note refinement in sophistication 
toward reliability prediction in the capsule contractor's figures for the 
ultimate 28-hour Mercury mission. At the August 1959 reliability symposium, 
McDonnell assigned impressively high percentage figures as reliability goals for 
both mission and safety success:

reliability studies for Gilruth's group, this kind of table represented the 
"numbers game," mere gambling odds that might deceive the naive into believing 
that if not the fourth, then the third, decimal place was significant. French 
was an experienced systems engineer who recognized that numbers like these did 
mean something: obviously the authors felt the weakest link in the chain of 
events necessary to achieve mission success was the launch vehicle. McDonnell 
believed the safety of the astronaut would be ensured by the escape system, but 
the coefficient ".7917" diluted the confidence in overall mission success to 
".7781." McDonnell and STG agreed that the onus was on the Atlas to prove its 
safety and reliability as a booster for the Mercury mission.
<P>That point was not disputed by the men responsible for the Atlas. They 
professed even less confidence in their product for this purpose than the 
capsule contractor had. Not until November 13, 1959, did representatives of the 
Air Force Ballistic Missile Division and Space Technology Laboratories visit 
Langley to present in detail their case for a thoroughgoing plan to man-rate the 
Atlas as a Mercury booster. Harry Powell had prepared a carefully qualified 
chart that estimated that the reliability of the Mercury booster would reach 
approximately 75 percent only in mid-1961, and the first upbend (at about 86 
percent) on that curve was to occur another year later.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> 
Such pessimism might have been overwhelming to STG except that no abort-sensing 
system was yet computed as a factor in this extrapolation. Also STG and STL 
agreed never to entertain the idea of "random failure" as a viable explanation.
<P>Because aircraft designers and missile experts held different opinions about 
which systems should be duplicated, redundancy itself was often a subject of 
dispute. Passenger aircraft were provided with many redundant features, 
including multiple engines and automatic, semi-automatic, and manual control 
systems, so that commercial flight safety had been made practically perfect. But 
in the military missile programs of 1959, redundancy to ensure mission success 
had been relegated to the duplication of the complete missile, "by making and 
launching enough to be sure that the required number will reach each target."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> 
In the age of "overkill," one out of four, for instance, might be considered 
quite sufficient to accomplish the destructive mission of the ICBM. Both 
McDonnell and the Task Group placed more faith in quality control procedures and 
in redundant system development than in mathematical models for reliability 
prediction during design.
<P>In the course of further symposia and conferences during the autumn, the 
Space Task Group, working with military systems analysts and industrial quality 
controllers, learned more than it taught about improving reliability programs. 
Abe Silverstein, whose Headquarters office was retitled Space Flight Programs 
(instead of Development) at the end of the year, was especially eager to see STG 
set up its own reliability program, with procedures for closer monitoring of 
subcontracts.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>[184] But before STG could presume to teach, it had to learn much more about 
the mechanics of the Redstone and the Atlas. Mathews had his own mathematicians 
check the case histories for failures of every Redstone, Jupiter, and Atlas that 
had ever been launched. A statistical population of over 60 Redstone and about 
30 Atlas launches yielded clinical diagnoses for generalizing about the most 
likely ways these boosters might fail. Gerald W. Brewer, Jack Cohen, and Stanley 
H. Cohn collected much of this work for STG, and then Mathews, Brandner of ABMA, 
White of STL, and others formulated some ground rules for the development of the 
two abort-sensing systems.
<P>All the investigators were pleasantly surprised to find relatively few 
catastrophic conditions among the failures. Their biggest problem was not what 
to look for or when to allow the escape rocket to blast away but rather how to 
avoid "nuisance aborts." Such unnecessary or premature escapes would arise from 
overemphasis on pilot safety or "positive redundancy" at the expense of mission 
success. Long arguments ensued over several questions: How simple is safe? How 
redundant can you get and still have simplicity? How do you design a fail-safe 
abort-sensing system without overdesigning its sensitivity to situations less 
than catastrophic?<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>

<P><CITE>Schematic of Mercury Redstone.</CITE> 
<P>
<HR>

<P>Without trying to define every term, Mathews and his associates agreed that 
only imminent catastrophic failures were to be sensed, that reliability should 
be biased in favor of pilot protection, and that all signals from abort sensing 
should be displayed in the spacecraft. Application of these ground rules to the 
Redstone led to development of an automatic abort-sensing system (AASS) that 
sensed "downstream" or fairly gross parameters, each of which was representative 
of many different types of failures. Merely "critical," as opposed to 
"catastrophic," situations were not allowed to trigger the escape system 
automatically. Such merely "critical" situations as partial loss of thrust, a 
fire in the capsule, deviation from flight path, or loss of tank pressure might 
possibly be corrected or tolerated. But catastrophic situations were defined as 
existing where there were no seconds of time for intelligent decisions, 
corrective actions, or manual abort. The abort system for the Mercury-Redstone 
sensed and was activated by such typical catastrophic situations as excessive 
attitude deviations or turning rates (leading to high angles of attack during 
high dynamic pressures and resulting in a structural breakup), as sudden loss of 
tank or bulkhead differential pressure in pressure-stabilized structures, as 
loss of electrical power in the control and instrument system, and as loss of 
thrust immediately after liftoff.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>If any of these situations should arise, the automatic abort-sensing system 
was supposed to initiate an explosively rapid sequence of events. First, the 
engine of the Redstone would cut off (except during the initial moments over the 
launch site). Then the capsule would separate from the booster. And this would 
be followed by the ignition of the escape rocket, with acceleration up and away 
from the booster, and finally by the normal sequencing of events in the recovery 
phase of the launch profile.
<P>[185] During August, September, and October, the Task Group improved its 
understanding of the interrelated parts and procedures being developed for 
Mercury. New definitions were formulated in hardware and words. Some old worries 
- the heatshield, for instance - were abandoned as newer concerns replaced them. 
The success of Big Joe and the promise of Little Joe shots promoted confidence 
and sustained enthusiasm. At the end of this period optimistic forecasts were 
the rule, not only for booster readiness but also for firm operational 
schedules. The first Mercury-Redstone and Mercury-Atlas qualification flight 
tests were scheduled for launchings in May 1960. Even the final goal of Project 
Mercury, the achievement of manned orbital flight around Earth, still appeared 
possible by March 1961.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
<P>But as autumn blended into winter in 1959, optimism cooled along with the 
weather. The job of keeping snow clear of its own drive was difficult enough, 
but heavier equipment than that possessed by the Task Group was necessary to 
plow aside the drifts that sometimes covered the streets of interagency 
cooperation. In particular, the Mercury-Redstone schedule began to look 
progressively more snowbound in the early winter of 1959, largely because the 
capsule and the Atlas commanded primary attention.
<P>At the end of August, Gilruth had proposed to Major General John B. Medaris, 
commanding ABMA, that the first attempt at a Mercury-Redstone launch from the 
Cape be set for February 1, 1960. This proposal represented a slippage of about 
four months since February 1959, when the initial understanding between ABMA and 
STG had been reached. But the prospects for rapid accomplishments in the next 
six months were brighter at Langley than at Huntsville, St. Louis, or the Cape. 
Plans to use eight Mercury-Redstones for ballistic training flights between 
February and October 1960 were still in effect, and STG also hoped to complete 
six manned Redstone flights by March 1961 before launching the first of the 
manned Mercury-Atlas configurations. Such optimism was not entirely the result 
of youthful naivete or of underestimates of complexity. In large part, target 
dates were set deliberately at the nearest edge of possible completion periods 
to combat Parkinson's Law regarding bureaucratic administration, that work 
expands to fill the time allotted for its completion.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>Much of the fault for Redstone slippages must revert to STG for having 
canceled the Mercury-Jupiter series rather precipitously, thereby 
unceremoniously relegating the 4000 members of von Braun's division at 
Huntsville almost to "task element" status as far as Mercury was concerned. 
Although the Jupiter program per se was being phased out at ABMA, its sires, who 
sparked the entire Army Ordnance team, were sensitive to criticism of their 
strange love for space travel.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source39"><SUP>39</SUP></A> 
STG engineers should not have been surprised that the cancellation of the 
Mercury-Jupiter series would cause a reaction in Huntsville that would 
reverberate to the Cape and through Washington.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>Although NASA Headquarters had carefully coordinated STG's recommendation in 
this matter, many other factors contributed to the change in the Mercury [186] 
program management plans that forecast the slip of MR-1 past MA-1 on the flight 
test schedule. There were at least three technical reasons for the 
Mercury-Redstone slippages as well as several other, perhaps more important, 
psychological and policy-planning reasons for this change in the "progressive 
buildup of tests" principle.
<P>Foremost among all causes of delay was the fact that the pacing item, 
McDonnell's production model of the Mercury capsule, took longer to build than 
anyone supposed it would.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source41"><SUP>4l</SUP></A> 
Because systems integration within the spacecraft was lagging by several months, 
every other area would be delayed also to some degree. Secondly, the design and 
development of the abort-sensing systems for the Redstone and Atlas were 
attacked separately and not cross-fertilized. The basic dispute over safety 
versus success, or positive versus negative redundancy, could be settled only 
with actual flight test experience.
<P>A third technical reason for the fact that the Redstone team, with its ready 
and waiting boosters, failed to lead off the series of qualification flight 
tests was [187] related to the Teutonic approach to reliability. Long years of 
experience with rockets, together perhaps with some native cultural concern for 
meticulous craftsmanship, gave the von Braun group high confidence that most 
so-called "reliability" problems could be obviated by hard work, more flight 
tests, and intensive engineering attention to every detail. Elaborate 
operational checkouts were to be made at Huntsville and the Cape. STG agreed to 
these procedures in August, but by November time was clearly in contention 
between Huntsville and Langley. The Task Group wanted to launch its first three 
Redstones for Mercury during May and June 1960, but if this were possible, it 
was hardly advisable from ABMA's point of view.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
<P>By then, however, this could be considered a family dispute among 
stepbrothers within NASA. On October 21, 1959, President Eisenhower announced 
his decision, pending congressional approval, to transfer the von Braun group 
and the Saturn project from ABMA to NASA. If this decision solved a morale 
problem among members of the Development Operations Division at ABMA, it 
undoubtedly complicated certain institutional and political problems. Jockeying 
for position probably intensified rather than abated, as plans for the future 
use of the Saturn launch vehicle overshadowed Mercury for the moment. Another 
five months were required to complete a transfer plan, and eight months would 
elapse before the official transfer was completed on July 1, 1960.<A

<P>Although the plans for the escape of a pilot from a malfunctioning Redstone 
were complex, plans for a similar emergency detection system on the Atlas were 
several times more complicated. Three engines, rather than one, with an overall 
range and thrust capability well over three times greater, and with guidance, 
gimbaling, and structural separation mechanisms far more complex than those to 
be used on the Redstone - these were some of the factors that put the problem of 
man-rating the Atlas on a higher plane of difficulty. The Mercury capsule escape 
system was, of course, the same for both boosters, but the emergency detection 
systems had to be tailored to the differences between the launching vehicles. 
The single-stage Redstone was a piece of battlefield artillery that could stand 
on its own four fins, for example, whereas the fragile "gas-bag" Atlas would 
crumple if not pressurized. And in flight, the Atlas' outboard engines must 
stage properly and drop away from the central sustainer engine before the escape 
tower could be jettisoned.
<P>While Charles Wilson and his crew at Convair in San Diego worked out the 
detailed design and hardware for ASIS, Richard White led Space Technology 
Laboratories through more detailed analytical studies and simulation tests at El 
Segundo. Their concurrent efforts ensured that the airborne emergency detection 
system for the Mercury-Atlas evolved, as Powell insisted it must, with the 
steadfast goal of reliability. Inspection and test programs were inaugurated 
separately by Hohmann, beginning in October, but reliability was designed into 
the ASIS black box from May onward. Wilson and White soon discovered that their 
biggest problem concerned the prevention of recontact between booster and 
capsule after separation. [188] Alan B. Kehlet and Bruce G. Jackson of STG had 
the primary responsibility to determine the proper thrust offset of the escape 
rocket and to ensure against recontact, but "Monte Carlo" probability analyses 
were done by both Convair and the Space Task Group.<A

<P>In addition to the ASIS, the Atlas D had to be modified in a number of other 
ways before it could carry a man. Because the Mercury-Atlas configuration was 
taller by approximately 20 feet than the Atlas D weapon system, the rate gyro 
package for the autopilot had to be installed 20 feet higher on the airframe, so 
it would sense more precisely the rate of change of booster attitude during 
launch. The Atlas would not need posigrade rockets to assist separation because 
the Mercury capsule would embody its own posigrade rockets inside its 
retrorocket package. Because the capsule's posigrade rockets could conceivably 
burn through the thin skin of the liquid-oxygen dome, a fiber-glass shield 
covering the entire dome was attached to the mating ring. The two small vernier 
rocket engines, which on the ICBM had thrust on after sustainer engine cutoff, 
or "SECO," for last-minute trajectory corrections, were regoverned to delete the 
"vernier solo" phase of operation, thus saving more weight and complexity. In 
addition to the use of older, more reliable types of valves and special 
lightweight telemetry, only one other major booster modification was considered 
at first. The man-rated Atlas D would use the so-called "wet start" instead of 
the newer, faster "dry start" method of ignition. A water pulse sent ahead of 
the fuel into the combustion chambers would effect slower and smoother initial 
thrust buildup, minimizing structural stress on the engine before liftoff. This 
change saved approximately 60 pounds, by enabling the use of a thinner skin 
gauge in the Atlas airframe. But the "thin-skinned" Atlas soon proved to be too 
thin-skinned, and the weight saved was lost again in 1961, when a thicker skin 
was found to be essential in the conical tank section just under the capsule. 
The longer, lighter spacecraft payload proved a cause of additional dynamic 
loads and buffeting problems, calling for more strength in the Atlas forebody.<A

<P>After additional study of the idiosyncracies of the Atlas missile, Mathews, 
Wilson of Convair, and White decided on the parameters most in need of 
monitoring for abort indications:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>the liquid oxygen tank pressure, 
  <LI>the differential pressure across the intermediate bulkhead, 
  <LI>the booster attitude rates about all three axes, 
  <LI>rocket engine injector manifold pressures, 
  <LI>sustainer hydraulic pressure, and 
  <LI>primary electrical power.</LI></OL>Dual sensors gauging each of these 
catastrophic possibilities were fairly easily developed. If any one of these 
conditions should arise or any system should fail, the ASIS would by itself 
initiate the explosive escape sequence. But any one of four men with their 
fingers poised over pushbuttons also could abort the mission: the test 
conductor, the flight director in the control center, the range safety officer, 
or the astronaut with his left thumb would be able to decide if and when the 
escape rocket should be ignited. But these manual abort capabilities were only 
supplements, with built-in time delays, to the automatic abort sensing and 
implementation system. [189] During the portion of the flight powered by the 
Atlas, human judgment was to be secondary to a transistorized watchdog 
autopilot. Their moral obligation to pilot safety made the Atlas redesigners 
reduce man-control to this minimum. Culbertson later explained, "While it was 
true that mission success provided pilot safety, provision for pilot safety did 
not always improve the probability of mission success"<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-4.htm#source46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>One of the most important analytical tasks in man-rating the Atlas was the 
careful and continuous study of the mathematical guidance equations for the 
launch phase of all the missions. Three men at Space Technology Laboratories 
shared this responsibility, C. L. Pittman, Robert M. Page, and Duncan McPherson. 
While Convair was learning that it cost approximately 40 percent more to build a 
man-rated Mercury-Atlas than a missile system, STL's mathematicians and systems 
engineers, like Hohmann and Letsch, were working out their differences on how to 
control quality and augment reliability. By the end of 1959, Hohmann [190] had 
sold his plans for pilot safety. They were based on applying supercharged 
aircraft production techniques to industrial practices for military missile 
production. To live with the Atlas required no less and eventually much more.<A

warning of potential disaster. Only when the cause is thoroughly understood, and 
a change to eliminate it has been made, can we proceed with the flight program."
