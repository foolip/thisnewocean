<H1>Little Joe 5 Votes No</H1>On Election Day, November 8, 1960, Space Task 
Group and McDonnell engineers at Wallops Island finally pulled the trigger on 
capsule No. 3, attached to Little Joe 5. Having planned LJ-5 for over a year as 
the first qualification flight of a production capsule to sustain abort 
conditions at maximum dynamic pressure, the hard-working crews were especially 
chagrined to see the disintegration of all their plans only 16 seconds after 
liftoff. At that time the escape rocket and the tower jettison rocket both 
prematurely ignited while the booster was still thrusting. Therefore booster, 
capsule, and tower stayed mated together throughout their ballistic trajectory 
until impact shattered them to fragments.
<P>Whether the limit switches at the clamp rings below or above the spacecraft 
were at fault, or whatever improper rigging, wiring, or voltage regulation was 
the cause, it was exceedingly hard to rationalize that something was learned 
from this flight failure. Spacecraft and booster continued on their arc 10 miles 
high and 13 miles out to sea before being mangled on impact 2 minutes later. 
Salvage operations in water 72 feet deep recovered 60 percent of the booster but 
only 40 percent of the capsule.<A

Extensive tests on the clamp-ring problem were conducted on rocket sleds at the 
Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California.
<P>For well over a year Holloman Air Force Base personnel, led by Major John D. 
Mosely, [292] of the Aeromedical Field Laboratory, had prepared a packaged 
payload with a medium-sized chimpanzee to ride the LJ-5 qualification flight. As 
late as mid-July 1960, operational planning still included a first-order test 
objective to determine the effects of a simulated Atlas abort acceleration on a 
chimp. The delay in capsule delivery and a large number of checkout difficulties 
encountered in late August, especially with the booster-capsule clamp rings and 
pyrotechnics, led William Bland and Rodney G. Rose to persuade Gilruth to rule 
out the primate on Little Joe 5. Besides that, the second Mercury-Redstone now 
being groomed for a chimp flight represented a direct conflict in scheduling.
<P>As disappointing as this decision was to aeromedical personnel, including 
James P. Henry, the physician who supervised the animal program for STG, the 
managers of the Task Group felt they could not afford to risk further delays. 
The structural integrity of McDonnell's Mercury capsule and the escape system 
during that most critical time in the region of highest dynamic pressure had to 
be demonstrated as soon as possible. By deliberately omitting the environmental 
control system and its problems, the Task Group had hoped to concentrate on 
hardware dynamics, taking extraordinary precautions "to minimize premature 
firing of any of the capsule pyrotechnics on the launching pad."<A

Obviously something - no one knew what - had been overlooked.
<P>After the dismal failure of Little Joe 5, these bleak days for Project 
Mercury became even bleaker with the discovery that the helium leak in the 
capsule for MR-1 could not be fixed quickly; it would require the replacement of 
certain valves and the whole hydrogen peroxide tank. Furthermore a change in the 
MR-1 wiring was dictated by the poor sequence and circuitry design on Little Joe 
5. NASA had one more Little Joe test booster on hand. One more airframe, the 
last one in existence, had recently been ordered as a backup to the next shot. 
On November 10, NASA Headquarters was reassured that a stripped capsule on the 
backup booster could fulfill the Little Joe 5 mission, "an essential one before 
manned flight," probably before the end of January. And both Mercury- Redstone 2 
and Mercury-Atlas 2 still were considered "not beyond the realm of possibility" 
for launchings in December.<A

<P>There was precious little in Mercury to be thankful for during the 
Thanksgiving season of 1960, but there was more than enough work to keep 
everyone in STG preoccupied. Caldwell C. Johnson wrote Faget a summary memo 
concerning the capsule's weight growth and its effect upon Atlas performance and 
mission profiles. While McDonnell was conducting extensive tests of the impact 
skirt situation, Johnson and others were worried about whether it would ever 
work. In the light of later developments, the ferment over redesign at this time 
became significant, and Johnson's words grew in significance: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have been monitoring Mercury weight growth, McDonnell's 
  airplane-weight history and the X-15 weight versus development phase and 
  conclude that Mercury orbit weight by the time of manned flight will exceed 
  3,000 pounds! Capsule weight during parachute opening mode will be 2,600 
  pounds; [293] flotation weight is practically as great. These increases have a 
  detrimental effect upon orbital insertion probability, retrograde action, 
  parachute opening loads, and water stability. The only single action that will 
  cure the problem is weight reduction in the capsule but its weight growth is 
  inexorable. It appears that several separate actions are necessary.
  <P>J. Mayer calculates that at 3,000 pounds the probability of orbit insertion 
  is less than 96 percent even when based upon certain Atlas performance 
  increases. Furthermore, the possibility of an African landing from an early 
  abort is very real. He says there are some reasons to believe that Atlas 
  weight can be further reduced and greater payload capacity realized but so far 
  this is but speculation, and, in any case, doesn't do much for the African 
  landing situation.
  <P>Some time ago increased retrograde capability was proposed but could not be 
  justified at that time. There is little doubt that such a change is justified 
  now - the question is whether posigrade impulse should likewise be increased 
  to aid orbit insertion. It is tempting to combine posigrade and retrograde 
  systems and to utilize the propellant as required by the particular flight 
  situation. But, this is a rather drastic change.<A

<P>"The really interesting scheme requires starting all over. Consider six (6) 
Pioneer or Explorer second stage motors clustered together as a 
posigrade-retrograde power pack. . . .
<P>"On the subject of parachutes and weights: it is quite likely that the impact 
skirt system and its associated 100 pounds of weight could be eliminated if the 
capsule impact attitude could be restricted to 'pilot feet first' and without 
much swing. The main difficulty now is the pilot's low tolerance to lateral 
acceleration. . . . This is not a proposal but it's worth thinking of."
