<H1>Notes on Sources</H1>Late in 1962 and early in 1963, while Project Mercury 
was phasing into the Manned One-Day Mission and evolving also toward Projects 
Gemini and Apollo, the managers of Mercury conceived the need for a monumental 
technical history to preserve the engineering "experience gained through the 
development of the Mercury spacecraft, its systems and components." The Director 
of the Manned Spacecraft Center, Robert R. Gilruth, expressed the hope that an 
elaborate, topically organized record in 10 or 12 volumes might "provide a ready 
reference and guide for present and future MSC space programs and to that end 
[should] increase the economy and effectiveness of MSC operations." Established 
in February 1963 as the Project Mercury Technical History Program (PMTHP), this 
effort produced about 40 retrospective manuscripts prepared by participants in 
Project Mercury. Although more than 130 authors were assigned sections to 
prepare and only one third of these ever completed their first drafts before 
reassignment, these manuscripts, located in the archives of the MSC Historian, 
furnished much of the basis for this technological history of Mercury.
<P>Concurrently in 1963, Eugene M. Emme, the NASA Historian, was prompting the 
preservation and collection of documentary materials and encouraging all NASA 
centers and especially the Mercury Project Office of MSC to proceed with the 
writing of the historical accounts of the technological, managerial, and 
administrative development of NASA's major programs. Documentary archives for 
manned space flight, therefore, began first in Washington and then in Houston 
while Mercury was still alive. The papers and correspondence of Robert R. 
Gilruth, George M. Low, Paul E. Purser, John A. Powers, and the astronauts' 
files constitute the bulk of the material presently contained in these two 
essentially duplicated archives, but innumerable smaller collections on specific 
technical and operational matters complement and amplify their usefulness.
<P>In May 1963 a contract was arranged between the Manned Spacecraft Center and 
the University of Houston to provide for professional help to assimilate and 
synthesize the massive documentary remains from Mercury in several forms 
suitable for wide distribution as historical literature. The two academic 
authors of this volume began full-time work immediately after the termination of 
Mercury, helping the MSC Historian to complete his <I>Project Mercury: A 
Chronology</I>, NASA SP-4001 (Washington, 1963). Shortly thereafter, an 
abbreviated and considerably sterilized "PMTHP" was published in one volume as 
<I>Mercury Project Summary: Including Results of the Fourth Manned Orbital 
Flight, May 15 and 16, 1963</I>, NASA SP-45 (Washington, 1963). These two works 
are basic reference tools; they are essential to, but not representative of, 
historical handicraft.
<P>The authors studied Congressional documents; periodicals; secondary 
literature on space science, technology, and public policy; unclassified 
governmental, industrial, and military reports; and the artifacts, including 
audio tapes and photographic records of the program. To orient themselves, they 
watched sequentially a major portion of more than one million feet of motion 
picture film, which preserved virtually every significant event and flight 
operation in Project Mercury.
<P>To maintain some historiographical balance, they sought to subject the widest 
variety of documents to external (or contextual) and internal scrutiny. 
Competitive industrial and governmental claims to priorities were weighed. 
Wherever possible the people who made up the Mercury team were interviewed and 
each location of Mercury activities visited. Finally the authors concluded that 
research could proceed most profitably by writing. Concurrent writing and 
research went on for more than a year, before a "comment edition" was 
distributed to some 200 critical readers, most of whom found time to offer 
indispensable suggestions for its improvement.
<P>Footnote readers will have noticed the somewhat different documentary bases 
of the three parts of this work. Part One rests largely on open (but little used 
for historical purposes) channels of scientific communication. Part Two is hewn 
out of a jungle of unpublished technical letters, messages, memoranda, telecon 
notes, informal reports, and working papers. Part Three is based progressively 
more on official project documentation, which had improved considerably by that 
relatively late date.
<P>Unless otherwise specified, all these materials, in original or facsimile 
form, have been gathered together in the MSC archives. Very few items among 
those cited in the footnotes are still classified; the vast majority are no 
longer sensitive and may be examined by students of the early history of manned 
space flight.
<P>More than 200 personal interviews, 134 Project Mercury working papers, and 
most of the 4,500 typical control and report documents listed in Appendix A of 
the <I>Mercury Project Summary</I> have served as the foundation for this 
history. The superstructure, however, is selective, as the bibliographical 
listing also must be. There are many other true tales that need to be placed in 
survivable form about the technology, administration, public relations, and 
human side of Project Mercury and the men who worked its wonders. But we authors 
hope that <I>This New Ocean</I> will map the temporal shoreline from which the 
United States of America cast off on its voyage into space.
