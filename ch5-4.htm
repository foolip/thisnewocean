<H1>"Aerospace" Technology</H1>One of the scientific questions of the 
International Geophysical Year that had to be answered before the orbital 
mechanics of a manned satellite could be specified in detail was: where 
precisely does Earth's atmosphere end? By late 1958 the aeromedical fraternity, 
following Hubertus Strughold's lead, had accepted the conceptual outlines of 
"space-equivalent altitudes," with refined definitions of the "aeropause," as a 
general biological guide to answer a slightly different question: [117] where 
does space begin? But upper-atmospheric studies, based on the actual behavior of 
the six or eight known artificial satellites plus the data gained from a few 
rocket probes and about 100 comparable sounding rockets and balloons, were 
neither definite enough nor codified well enough to plan the precise height at 
which man should first orbit Earth.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>The NASA/ARPA mission specification of a circular orbit to be achieved by 
"the most reliable available boost system . . . at an altitude sufficiently high 
to permit a 24-hour satellite lifetime" (before the natural decay, or 
degradation, of the original orbit because of slight but effective 
upper-atmospheric friction) had carefully avoided a commitment to either a 
booster or an orbital altitude. The Space Task Group proceeded on the assumption 
that both apogee and perigee of the manned ballistic satellite should be within 
the rough limits of 100±25 miles high. The Task Group chose 100 statute miles 
(87 nautical miles) as the nominal average altitude to ensure a full-Earth-day 
lifetime for the one-ton manned moonlet.
<P>The outer limits of Earth's atmosphere, where it blends in equilibrium with 
the solar atmosphere or plasma, seemed around 2,000 miles, and the "edge" of the 
outer ionospheric shell was thought to be perhaps 4,000 miles above sea level, 
but these were irrelevant parameters for orbit selections. ICBM performance data 
at that time made it certain that the "most reliable available boost system" 
could not boost a 2,200-pound ballistic capsule even to the 400-or-so-mile 
"floor" of the Van Allen belt.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>The Atlas ICBM was still "the most reliable available boost system"; there 
was as yet no viable alternative booster. All preliminary hardware planning had 
been based on the assumption that the Atlas would prove its power and prowess 
very soon. The NACA nucleus of NASA was composed for the most part of 
aeronautical engineers, airplane men not yet expert with missiles and rockets. 
Few of them at first fully realized how different were the flight regimes and 
requirements for the technology of flight without wings.
<P>Since World War II winged guided missiles or pilotless drone airplanes had 
given way to rocket-propelled ballistic projectiles; by 1958 the industrial base 
and engineering competence for missilery had matured separately from and 
tangentially to the aviation industry.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> 
If the manned satellite program were to become the first step for sustained 
manned space flight, a new synthesis between science and engineering and a new 
integration between the aircraft and missile industries would be necessary. 
"Space science" and "aerospace technology," terms already made popular by the 
Air Force, were now in the public domain, but their meanings were vague and 
ambiguous so long as they held so little operational content. Silverstein, 
Crowley, and Albert F. Siepert, the men who became the first executive directors 
of the top three "line offices" of NASA Headquarters, indubitably had their 
debates on programming operations for NASA and the Nation. But on the need for 
new syntheses and reintegrations of established disciplines and industries there 
could be no debate. NASA's legal mandate to coordinate and to contract [118] for 
cooperative development "of the usefulness, performance, speed, safety, and 
efficiency of aeronautical and space vehicles" was second only to its first 
objective in the Space Act, expanding "human knowledge of phenomena in the 
atmosphere and space."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>The complex prehistory of NASA and the manned satellite program began to 
impinge on NASA policy. It affected project planners as soon as they set forth 
their intention to put a man into orbit. Industrial and military investments in 
feasibility studies to this same goal had been heavy. The Space Task Group 
decided in mid-October to withdraw from all contacts with industrial contractors 
while finishing its preliminary specifications for the manned satellite capsule. 
STG thus avoided any accusations of favoritism, but lost about two months in 
time before it was able to acquire the latest classified and proprietary studies 
and designs by other organizations.
<P>Three most pertinent examples of industrial research going on concurrently 
with government research and leading up to seminal proposals for manned 
satellite specifications were those studies being conducted by the 
Convair/Astronautics Division (CV/A) of the General Dynamics Corporation in 
conjunction with the Avco Manufacturing Corporation, studies by the General 
Electric Company in conjunction with North American Aviation, Inc., and those by 
McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. The CV/A-Avco proposal to the Air Force in April 
1958 for a spherical drag-braked manned satellite was followed by more reports 
by CV/A in June and November, and these proved that the builders of the Atlas 
were exploring every avenue for civilian uses of their booster rocket. Convair 
men like Karel J. Bossart, Mortimer Rosenbaum, Charles S. Ames, Frank J. Dore, 
Hans R. Friedrich, Byron G. MacNabb, F. A. Ford, Krafft A. Ehricke, and H. B. 
Steele had a continuing interest in seeing their fledgling weapons carrier 
converted into a launch vehicle for manned space flight, either with or without 
an upper stage.
<P>At NASA Headquarters, Abe Silverstein decided early in November to formalize 
his earlier approval of Faget's plan for the "bare Atlas." On that basis a 
formal bidders' briefing for the capsule contract was planned for November 7. 
Only after mid-December, when all the proposals were in, did STG learn how great 
had been other industrial investments in research for a manned ballistic 
satellite.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>Although the Atlas airframe, design, and systems integration had all grown 
directly out of Convair engineering development, the liquid-fueled rocket 
engines for the Atlas, as well as for the Redstone, Jupiter, and Thor missiles, 
were all products of the Rocketdyne Division of North American Aviation, Inc. 
Hence North American, when teamed with another corporate giant, General 
Electric, appeared also to be a prime contender for the manned satellite 
contract. The Space Task Group was only dimly aware at this time of the 
specifications that had emerged from North American and General Electric as 
proposals for the Air Force's "Man-in-Space-Soonest" studies, but it did know at 
least that its own ballistic capsule plan was at variance with the "high lift 
over drag" thinking at North American.<A

<P>[119] Back in May 1957, five months before <I>Sputnik I,</I> James S. 
McDonnell, Jr., the founder and president of a growing aircraft corporation 
bearing his name, gave an address at an engineering school commencement 
ceremony. He predicted a speculative timetable for astronautics that placed the 
achievement of the first manned Earth satellite, weighing four tons and costing 
one billion dollars, between the years 1990 and 2005 A.D. One year later, in a 
similar address, McDonnell sagaciously abandoned his timetable and said: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think it is fortunate that the Soviets have boldly challenged us 
  in [space science and exploration] . . . . Their space challenge is a fair 
  challenge. We should accept this challenge and help to turn it primarily into 
  peaceful channels.
  <P>So, fellow pilgrims, welcome to the wondrous age of astronautics. May 
  serendipity be yours in the years to come as man stands on the earth as a 
  footstool and reaches out to the moon, the planets, and the stars.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source24"><SUP>24</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Off 
and on since <I>Sputnik II,</I> McDonnell Aircraft Corporation's Advanced 
Planning Group had assigned first 20, then 40, and, from April through June 
1958, some 70 men to work on preliminary designs for a manned satellite capsule. 
Led by Raymond A. Pepping, Lawrence M. Weeks, John F. Yardley, and Albert Utsch, 
these men had completed a thoroughgoing prospectus 427 pages in length by 
mid-October 1958. People at Langley had been aware of this work in some detail, 
but when NACA and PARD became part of NASA, a curtain of discretion fell between 
them and STG. The McDonnell proposal was repolished during November before it 
took its turn and its chances with all the rest of the bidders.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
<P>While interested aerospace companies were endeavoring to fulfill the 
Government's plans and specifications for a manned satellite, a number of men in 
the institutional setting at Langley were busily engaged in final preparations 
for the bidders' conference. Craftsmen like Z. B. Truitt and Scott Curran, in 
the Langley shops, fabricated new models of both the couch and the capsule for 
demonstration purposes. Engineering designers like Caldwell C. Johnson and 
Russell E. Clickner, Jr., reworked multiple sets of mechanical drawings until 
Faget and the Task Group were satisfied that they had the architectonic 
engineering briefing materials ready for their prospective spacecraft 
manufacturing contractors. Gilruth, Donlan, Mathews, and Zimmerman meanwhile 
approved the block diagrams of systems as they evolved. They looked over their 
requirements for outside support in future launching operations, flight 
operations, trouble-shooting research, and crew selection and training. With 
everything going on at once among half a hundred men at most, there was no time 
now in STG for second thoughts or doubts about whether the "Faget concept" would 
work.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
<P>Questions of policy and personnel at the time of the organization of NASA and 
during the birth of this nation's manned space flight program were affected 
significantly by a conflict then existing between the experts on men and the 
experts on missiles. In the eyes of the Space Task Group, the medical 
fraternity, particularly some Air Force physicians, was exceedingly cautious, 
whereas the Space Task Group [120] seemed overly confident to some Air Force 
medical men and some of their pilots. During the deliberations of the joint 
NASA-ARPA Manned Satellite Panel, the contrast between the technical aspects of 
the Air Force's "Man-in-Space-Soonest" proposal and the Faget plan sponsored by 
the Langley-PARD group had been resolved in favor of the latter. Air Force 
planners of the Air Research and Development Command early had accepted a basic 
ground rule specifying 12 g as the design limit for capsule reentry loads. They 
had opposed the so-called "bare Atlas" approach, which would carry the risk of 
imposing accelerations up to 20 g in case of a mid-launch abort. As a last 
resort they too had turned to the standard Atlas as the most feasible launch 
vehicle even though, Faget believed, Air Force aeromedical experts had not 
accepted the significance of the physiological demonstrations by Carter C. 
Collins and R. Flanagan Gray on the Navy's centrifuge at Johnsville in July that 
man could sustain 20 g without lasting harmful effects. In calculating the risks 
in manned space flight, the group at Langley saw this event as having paramount 
importance.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
<P>To ensure that NASA would have intelligent liaison and some expertise of its 
own in dealing with military aeromedical organizations, one of the early 
official actions of the NASA Administrator was the appointment on November 21 of 
a Special Committee on Life Sciences, headed by W. Randolph Lovelace II. This 
committee, composed of members from the Air Force, Army, Navy, Atomic Energy 
Commission, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and private life, 
should provide "objective" advice on the role of the human pilot and all 
considerations involving him. However, NASA and particularly STG would soon 
discover certain difficulties with this, as with other, review committees 
"having a certain amount of authority . . . yet no real responsibility" for 
seeing that the program worked properly.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-4.htm#source28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>On a similar but lower plane, Gilruth asked for and received from the 
military services three professional consultants for an aeromedical staff. 
Lieutenant Colonel Stanley C. White from the Air Force and Captain William S. 
Augerson from the Army were physicians with considerable experience in aerospace 
medicine, and Lieutenant Robert B. Voas from the Navy held a Ph. D. in 
psychology. Thus both NASA and STG ensured the autonomy of their medical advice 
while at the same time they tapped, through White, the biomedical knowledge 
gained by the Air Force in its "Man-in-Space-Soonest" studies and, through 
Augerson, that gained by the Army and Navy through joint biosatellite 
planning.<A

rocket flights was generally accepted by 1958 as being a matter of altitude, 
with the division point at a height of one Earth radius. Sounding rockets were 
those ascending to about 3900 miles; instrumented rockets going higher than that
