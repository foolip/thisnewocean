<H1>NASA Gets The Job</H1>After the passage of the Space Act on July 16, Killian 
had requested from Dryden a formal memorandum placing on record NACA's views 
regarding a manned satellite project. Two days later, a week and a half before 
Eisenhower signed the act, Dryden sent his memorandum to Killian. The NACA 
director sketched his organization's extensive research background in such 
pertinent areas as control systems for hypersonic vehicles, thermodynamics, 
heat-resistant structural materials, and the current X-15 project. Then, in his 
strongest official statement up to that time on development, operations, and 
managerial responsibilities, Dryden concluded, "The assignment of the direction 
of the manned satellite program to NASA would be consistent with the President's 
message to Congress and with the pertinent extracts from the National 
Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958. . . ."<A

<P>Like everyone else, including Air Force leaders, Dryden wanted to avert a 
potential conflict between NASA and the Air Force regarding manned space flight. 
On the same day that Eisenhower signed the Space Act, July 29, Dryden met with 
Roy Johnson and Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy to discuss the future 
management of manned space programs, but no agreement was reached. The conferees 
adjourned to await action from the White House.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source88"><SUP>88</A></SUP>
<P>Some time between then and August 20, probably on August 18 ,Eisenhower made 
his decision. Again apparently acting on Killian's advice, he assigned to NASA 
specific responsibility for developing and carrying out the mission of manned 
space flight. This decision provided the coup de grace to the Air Force's plans 
for Man-in-Space-Soonest. Deputy Secretary of Defense Quarles decided the $53.8 
million that had been set aside for various Air Force space projects, [102] 
including Man-in-Space-Soonest (but not Dyna-Soar), would constitute part of the 
$117 million to be transferred from the Defense Department to NASA. LeMay, Air 
Force Vice Chief of Staff, then notified the Air Research and Development 
Command that he was transferring $10 million previously earmarked for the 
Soonest project. He added that Eisenhower's action obviously made impossible the 
immediate project approval Schriever had urged on July 24. A seventh and final 
manned satellite development plan, which the Ballistic Missile Division 
submitted to ARDC on September 11, significantly dropped the term "Soonest" from 
its descriptive title.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source89"><SUP>89</A></SUP>
<P>The Air Force would proceed with its Dyna-Soar project in conjunction with 
NASA and later would inaugurate a "Discoverer biosatellite program" based on the 
117L system. After August 1958, however, the project to rocket into orbit a man 
in a ballistic capsule was under undisputed civilian management, although it 
would draw heavily on all three services as well as industry and universities.
<P>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration received authorization to 
carry out this primitive manned venture into lower space mainly because 
Eisenhower was wedded to a "space for peace" policy. He was joined by his 
closest advisers, most members of Congress, and perhaps a majority of 
politically conscious Americans. In 1958 there simply was no clear military 
justification for putting a man in orbit.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source90"><SUP>90</A></SUP> 
And while there is little evidence on this point, it may be assumed that the 
very ambitiousness of the Air Force planners, to whom the orbiting of a manned 
ballistic vehicle was only the first phase of a costly program aimed at putting 
a man on the Moon, discouraged the budget-conscious Eisenhower administration. 
Already enormous sums were being spent on ballistic missiles and other forms of 
advanced weapons technology.
<P>Also helping to influence the President and his advisers, however, was the 
fact that NACA, around which NASA would be built, already had gone far in 
designing, testing, planning, and generally making itself ready for the 
execution of a manned satellite project. For months representatives from NACA 
Headquarters had conferred periodically with prospective contractors like Avco, 
Lockheed, and General Electric on such subjects as heatshield technology, 
environmental control systems, and communications requirements.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source91"><SUP>91</A></SUP> 
As early as March 1958, both before and after the Ames conference, Maxime Faget 
and Caldwell C. Johnson, working in PARD, together with Charles Mathews of the 
Langley Flight Research Division, had drawn up basic outlines for the manned 
ballistic satellite mission, the capsule configuration and internal equipment, 
heating loads and structural considerations, and weight limitations for a manned 
payload lifted into orbit by an Atlas. Throughout the spring and summer, 
Johnson, a self-made engineer attached to PARD from the Langley Engineering 
Services Division, continually modified his designs and specifications for the 
"can" to be mounted on the Atlas ICBM.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source92"><SUP>92</A></SUP>
<P>By the end of the summer, experimenters operating in the 2,000-foot towing 
tank at the Virginia laboratory already were using Langley-made scale models and 
[105] dummies of the ballistic capsule in water impact trials, while other 
engineers were carrying out air-drop tests of a boilerplate capsule parachute 
system over Chesapeake Bay. And a group from the Lewis laboratory was commuting 
regularly to Langley to participate in design discussions on all the orbital 
spacecraft systems, especially on thermal protection techniques and on the 
attitude control, separation (posigrade), and reentry (retrograde) rockets.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source93"><SUP>93</A></SUP>
<P>Meanwhile Faget's and Paul Purser's proposal made early in the year for a 
clustered-rocket test booster to be used in payload design research and in 
manned vertical flights had undergone a politic modification. After Dryden 
publicly drew his analogy between the Army's Project Adam and the circus lady 
shot from a cannon, the PARD research team leaders dropped the name "High Ride" 
and shelved their ideas for using the rocket to fire a man into space. In 
August, Faget asked William M. Bland, Jr., and Ronald Kolenkiewicz of PARD to 
prepare precise specifications for a vehicle to launch full-scale and 
full-weight capsules to a maximum altitude of 100 miles. Only a year would pass 
before the experimental rocket went into operation. When it did, the former 
"High Ride" would have acquired the new nickname "Little Joe."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source94"><SUP>94</A></SUP>
<P>Only three days after Eisenhower signed the Space Act and more than two [106] 
weeks before he formally gave the manned satellite job to NASA, Dryden and 
several other representatives of the disappearing NACA had testified before the 
House space committee on their budget request for $30 million for fiscal 1959. 
Assistant Director Gilruth of Langley gave a hurriedly prepared presentation on 
plans for a manned ballistic satellite; his remarks amounted to the first open 
discussion of the technical aspects of what was soon to become Project Mercury. 
After exhibiting models of the contour couch and an outdated cone-shaped 
capsule, Gilruth turned to the proposed launch vehicle. Here he revealed the 
fears and hopes about the Atlas that would characterize NASA's efforts to orbit 
a man:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Atlas . . . has enough performance to put this in orbit and 
  the guidance system is accurate enough, but there is the matter of 
  reliability. You don't want to put a man in a device unless it has a very good 
  chance of working every time.
  <P>There are scheduled many Atlas firings in the next year and a half. 
  Reliability is something that comes with practice. It is to be anticipated 
  that this degree of reliability will occur as a result of just carrying out 
  the national ballistic missile program.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source95"><SUP>95</A></SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Main Committee of NACA held its last meeting on August 21 and formally 
extended best wishes to NASA and Administrator Glennan, who attended the 
meeting.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source96"><SUP>96</A></SUP> 
In mid-September, Glennan and Roy Johnson of ARPA agreed that their two agencies 
should join in a "Man-in-Space program based on the 'capsule' technique."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source97"><SUP>97</A></SUP> 
They then established a joint NASA-ARPA Manned Satellite Panel to draw up 
specific recommendations and a basic procedural plan for the manned satellite 
project. Composed of Gilruth, who served as chairman, and Faget of Langley, 
Eggers of Ames, Williams of the Flight Station, and George M. Low and Warren J. 
North of Lewis, representing NASA, together with Robertson C. Youngquist and 
Samuel Batdorf of ARPA, the panel began holding meetings during the last week of 
September.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source98"><SUP>98</A></SUP>
<P>On September 25, Glennan issued a proclamation declaring that "as of the 
close of business September 30, 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration has been organized and is prepared to discharge the duties and 
exercise the powers conferred upon it."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-8.htm#source99"><SUP>99</A></SUP> 
In a message to all NACA personnel he added:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One way of saying what will happen would be to quote from the 
  legalistic language of the Space Act. . . . My preference is to state it in a 
  quite different way - that what will happen . . . is a sign of metamorphosis. 
  It is an indication of the changes that will occur as we develop our 
  capacities to handle the bigger job that is ahead. We have one of the most 
  challenging assignments that has ever been given to modern man.<A

<P>On Tuesday afternoon, September 30, more than 8,000 people left work as 
employees of the 43-year-old NACA. The next morning almost all of them returned 
to their same jobs with NASA.
