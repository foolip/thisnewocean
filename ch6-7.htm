<H1>Supporting Agencies and Industries</H1>One of these complexities had been 
pointed up in the course of planning operational procedures for launching. Back 
in November 1958 the Air Force Missile Test Center had accepted Melvin N. Gough 
as director of NASA tests, but it was May 1959 before the Center made any 
allowance for the functioning of NASA's skeleton staff for the manned satellite 
program. When Herbert F. York, the Pentagon's Director of Defense Research and 
Engineering, testified before Congress early in June, he alluded to the 
coordination problem between the Department of Defense and NASA and admitted, 
"We haven't worked out exactly how to do that yet." B. Porter Brown, the first 
STG man to take up residence at the Cape, told his superior, Charles Mathews, 
that the administration of the launch complexes at the Atlantic Missile Range 
was as intricate as the technical equipment there.<A

<P>On May 1, 1959, when NASA set up its own liaison office at Canaveral, Brown 
and the STG were still trying to understand all the interrelationships [155] 
existing between the Air Force (whose proprietorship stemmed from the 
establishment in 1950 of the Long Range Proving Ground), the Navy, and the Army. 
The Air Force Missile Test Center (AFMTC) was the steward operating the Atlantic 
Missile Range (AMR) for the Department of Defense. The Army had established its 
subsidiary Missile Firing Laboratory on the Cape as an integral part of its 
Ballistic Missile Agency. By the end of January 1959, Kurt H. Debus, director of 
the firing lab, had appointed a project engineer and coordinator for the 
Mercury-Redstone program, but the conversion of launch pads Nos. 5 and 6 into 
"Launch Complex No. 56" to meet the requirements for Mercury-Redstone launchings 
was less imperative than the need to prepare for the Fourth of July launch of 
Mercury's Big Joe by an Air Force Atlas.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-7.htm#source60"><SUP>60</A></SUP>
<P>The palmetto-covered dunes at Canaveral had several dozen different kinds of 
launch pads, but they were still in short supply and under heavy demands. There 
were almost as many different military service and civilian contract 
organizations vying for them as there were pads. Proprietary interests were 
strongly vested, security restrictions were rigorous, and the newly constituted 
space agency was not yet accepted in the elite flight operations society there. 
Hangar S, in the industrial area of the Cape, had been tentatively assigned as 
"NASA space," but the former Naval Research Laboratory team that had built 
Hangar S and was still active with the Vanguard project was there first. 
Although now incorporated with NASA, the Vanguard team hoped to carry on with a 
new booster development program named Vega. Another group of half-NASA 
developers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working with von Braun's people, were 
likewise seeking more room to convert Juno I (Jupiter-C) into Juno II (Jupiter 
IRBM) launch facilities for more Explorer satellite missions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-7.htm#source61"><SUP>61</A></SUP>
<P>With space for space (as opposed to defense) activities at such a premium, 
Porter Brown and his two advance-guard colleagues for STG at the Cape, Philip R. 
Maloney and Elmer H. Buller, pressed for a higher priority in Hangar S. But room 
was still scarce in early June when Scott H. Simpkinson with about 35 of his 
test operations engineers from Lewis Research Center arrived to set up a 
preflight checkout laboratory for Big Joe. They found a corner fourth of Hangar 
S roped off for their use, and instructions not to overstep these bounds.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-7.htm#source62"><SUP>62</A></SUP>
<P>Another problem arose over the scheduled allocation of launch pad No. 14, 
which was one of only five available for Atlas launchings. Pad 14 was scheduled 
to be used for the Air Force MIDAS (Missile Defense Alarm Satellite) launchings 
throughout the same time period that the Mercury qualification flights were 
expected to be ready. Although admitting that firing schedules for both the 
Mercury-Redstone and the Mercury-Atlas programs were tentative, STG argued that 
the same pad assigned for the Big Joe shot should be continuously available for 
preparing all subsequent Mercury-Atlas launches.
<P>The commander of the Air Force Missile Test Center disagreed. In the cause of 
maximum utilization of Cape facilities, Major General Donald N. Yates ordered 
switching of Mercury launches to various available launch stands. These initial 
[156] conflicts of interests reached an impasse on June 24, when representatives 
of NASA and the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense 
met to decide whose shots to postpone. NASA was unable to obtain a concession: 
the urgency of ICBM and MIDAS development took precedence.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-7.htm#source63"><SUP>63</A></SUP>
<P>The complexity of organizational problems at the Cape might have led space 
agency leaders to despair but for an auspicious space flight on May 28. On that 
date in 1959 an Army Jupiter intermediate range ballistic missile launched a 
nose cone carrying two primate passengers - Able, an American-born rhesus 
monkey, and Baker, a South American squirrel monkey - to a 300-mile altitude. At 
the end of 15 minutes and a 1500-mile trajectory, along which the cone reached a 
speed of about 10,000 miles an hour, the Navy recovered Able and Baker alive and 
healthy. The medical experiments were conducted by the Army Medical Service and 
the Army Ballistic Missile Agency with the cooperation of the Navy and Air Force 
Schools of Aviation Medicine. Not only was the flight a triumph for space 
medicine; it also demonstrated an organizational symbiosis of significant 
proportions for all of the services and branches involved.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-7.htm#source64"><SUP>64</A></SUP>
<P>But the "interface" problems within NASA, and between NASA and other 
agencies, continued to exist, particularly at lower echelons in the planning of 
operational procedures for flight control. Mathews and his staff in the Flight 
Operations Division of STG were required to plan and replan mission profiles, 
schedules, countdown procedures, and mission directives while accommodating the 
procedures of other divisions and organizations contributing to the operation. 
By mid-spring these working relationships had become so involved that flight 
schedules had to undergo radical revision. It gradually became clear that the 
original schedules aimed at achieving a manned orbital flight early in April 
1960 could not possibly be met.
<P>On top of that, the production of spacecraft hardware and flight equipment 
began falling behind schedule. Only one month after the Mockup Review, it became 
evident that capsule and systems production slippages were going to become 
endemic. On April 17, 1959, Gilruth, speaking before the World Congress of 
Flight meeting at Las Vegas, announced casually, "The first manned orbital 
flight will not take place within the next two years." The first successful pad 
abort using the tower-rocket escape system had just been completed on April 12 - 
two years to the day before Gagarin's orbital flight - but Gilruth cautiously 
refrained from pronouncing even the escape sequence firm. And he alluded to 
other areas of uncertainty: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although the Mercury concept is the simplest possible approach to 
  manned flight in space, involving a minimum of new developments, as you can 
  see, a great deal of research and development remains to be done. For flight 
  within the atmosphere, the capsule must be stable over the widest speed range 
  yet encountered by any vehicle-from satellite velocity to a very low impact 
  speed. And in orbital flight, all of the systems must function properly in a 
  weightless state. It must be compatible with the launch rocket and must be at 
  home on the sea while awaiting recovery.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-7.htm#source65"><SUP>65</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>[157] 
In May 1959 the Mercury managers drew up a new functional organization chart 
dividing the supervisory activities of STG into five categories: capsules, 
boosters and launch, "R and D" support, range, and recovery operations. The 
design period for each of these areas having now evolved into developmental 
work, each area could more plainly be seen in terms of the contracts to be 
monitored by STG personnel. Capsules were divided into three categories, the 
first of which was the boilerplate models being built by Langley for the Little 
Joe program. For Big Joe, alias the Atlas ablation test, another boilerplate 
capsule was under construction jointly, with the STG at Langley responsible for 
the upper section and the STG at Lewis for the lower pressure-vessel section of 
the capsule. This meant that Langley in conjunction with Radioplane would 
perfect the recovery gear and parachute canister, while Lewis people would 
handle the automatic control system, the heatshield, sensors, and telemetry.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-7.htm#source66"><SUP>66</A></SUP>
<P>For the production model capsule under McDonnell's aegis, a number of major 
subcontractors had long since been selected. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator 
Company was developing the automatic stabilization and control system; the 
reaction control system was being built by Bell Aerospace Corporation; some 
electronics and most radio gear were to be provided by Collins Radio Company; 
and the environmental control system, the periscope, and the horizon scanner 
were to be supplied by AiResearch, Perkin-Elmer Company, and Barnes Instrument 
Company, respectively. The alternative heatshields, as previously noted, were 
being provided by several different subcontractors; and the solid rockets for 
escape by Grand Central Rocket Company and for the retrothrust package by 
Thiokol Chemical Corporation.
<P>With regard to boosters and launching, STG could rely on the extensive 
experience of the Ballistic Missile Division/Space Technology Laboratory/Convair 
complex for the Atlas, and on the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and the von 
Braun/Debus team for the Redstones. Only the Little Joe shots from Wallops 
Island would require extensive attention to launch problems because only Little 
Joe was exclusively a NASA booster. North American, the prime contractor, would 
provide whatever Langley could not for Little Joe.
<P>Under the miscellaneous category "R and D support," however, Project Mercury 
would not only require the help of all the other NASA research centers - 
Langley, Ames, Lewis, and now Goddard - but also of the NASA stations for 
high-speed flight research at Edwards, California, and for pilotless aircraft 
research at Wallops Island, Virginia. At least 10 separate commands under the 
Air Force would be closely involved, and various facilities of the Navy Bureau 
of Aeronautics, especially the human centrifuge at Johnsville, Pennsylvania, 
would likewise be extensively used.
<P>The range and tracking network requirements being supervised by the alter ego 
to STG, namely the Tracking Unit (TAGIU) or the Mercury network group at 
Langley, gradually became clear as contractors began to report on their 
feasibility and programming studies. The Lincoln Laboratory of the Massachusetts 
[159] Institute of Technology, the Aeronutronics Division of the Ford Motor 
Company, Space Electronics Corporation, and the RCA Service Company held four 
study contracts to help Soulé decide on ground equipment, radar coverage, 
control center arrangements, and the exact specifications for various contracts. 
Although a preliminary bidders' briefing on the tracking, telemetry, and 
telecommunications plans for Project Mercury took place at Langley on April 1, 
the basic design document, "Specifications for Tracking and Ground 
Instrumentation System for Project Mercury," did not appear until May 21. 
Consequently NASA did not select the prime contractor for the tracking network 
until midsummer.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-7.htm#source67"><SUP>67</A></SUP>
<P>Finally, regarding recovery operations, a NASA and Department of Defense 
working group decided on May 11 to make use of the investment already made by 
Grumman Aircraft Corporation in operations research for its spacecraft bid 
proposal on recovery requirements. Concurrently arrangements were being made 
with the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commander in Chief of the Atlantic 
Fleet, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, the Strategic Air Command, the 
Atlantic Missile Range, the Marines, and the Coast Guard for the specific help 
each could render when the time should come for search and retrieval.
<P>Although these relations appeared to have grown exceedingly complex, they had 
only just begun to multiply. Gilruth, however, was confident that by careful 
coordination and through the largely personal and informal working methods of 
STG, he and his men could handle the problems arising in the Mercury development 
program. As an encouraging example, the booster and launch coordination panels, 
established separately for the Atlas and the Redstone, had by mid-May already 
achieved impressive understandings on what had to be done. In the case of the 
Atlas, the coordination panel worked out the division of labor between NASA, 
McDonnell, the Ballistic Missile Division, Convair, and STG. Panel members 
simply discussed until they had resolved such key problems on their agenda as 
general launch operations procedures, trajectories and flight plans for the 
first two scheduled launches, general approach to an abort sensing system and 
procedures, range and pad safety procedures,general mechanical and electrical 
mating, blockhouse space requirements, general countdown and checkout 
procedures, and velocity cutoff in the event of overshooting the orbit insertion 
point. Six Redstone booster and launch panels, established at an important 
coordination meeting on February 11 with STG and McDonnell at Redstone Arsenal, 
likewise resolved in monthly meetings many such items.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-7.htm#source68"><SUP>68</A></SUP> 
For both boosters, many details remained outstanding, of course, but the fact 
that pending problems were being identified early and systematically in May 1959 
gave the STG confidence that no further schedule slippages could be charged to 
the lack of intelligent planning.<A

recognition that no one was in charge of <I>total system</I> analysis, <I>total

technical direction. This was one of the features of the Air Force ballistic 
missile program wherein Ramo-Wooldridge functioned as the <I>systems</I> 
engineering and technical director. The lack of such an agency within the 
Mercury program was understandable, for NASA was without experience in 
undertakings of such scope and magnitude, but it should be recognized and 
recorded historically as an expensive 'lesson learned' that cost NASA (and the 
United States) perhaps a year or more in meeting the Mercury goals." P. 13.
