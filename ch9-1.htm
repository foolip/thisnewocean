<H1>Chapter 9</H1>
<H1>From Development into Qualification: Flight Tests</H1>
<H2>(July - December 1960)</H2>In mid-1960, NASA and its Space Task Group hoped 
soon to begin launching a major qualification flight test for Project Mercury 
every six weeks. If all went well, these tests of the operational vehicles 
should permit a man to ride into space before the end of the year. But if 
Mercury's developmental experience to date was any guide, troubles could be 
expected to pyramid and might require more than six months to correct. Since the 
ultimate goal of Project Mercury was to achieve man-in-orbit rather than merely 
a sounding-rocket ride by a man into space, the Task Group would be running 
concurrent flight tests with the Little Joe, the Mercury-Redstone, and the 
Mercury-Atlas combinations. But attention and impetus were focused on the 
accomplishment of manned orbital circumnavigation.
<P>NASA Administrator T. Keith Glennan sent a memorandum to his Director of 
Space Flight Programs, Abe Silverstein, on July 11, 1960, prompting him to make 
every effort to put forward to November the launch of MR-3, long designated the 
first manned suborbital flight. If that was not possible, Glennan urged 
Silverstein to hold fast the schedule for the first manned launching before the 
end of the year. Silverstein replied that the manned event had just been reset 
for the week of December 5. By mid-August 1960 the most realistic estimate of 
the earliest possible man- launching changed the program management plans once 
again and reset the MR-3 launching for mid-January 1961. As late as October 
1960, this optimism prevailed while work on capsule No. 7 for MR-3 proceeded 
"somewhat better than expected."<A

<P>Having once called the Army's stillborn Project Adam a "circus stunt" because 
it proposed little more than shooting a man into space, Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy 
Administrator of NASA, had himself set a precedent for the criticisms of those 
influential scientists who came to regard Project Mercury as more of an 
exhibition than a demonstration. During 1959 few had raised their voices against 
NASA's plans and STG's development program for a manned satellite. But during 
this election year of 1960, many citizens scrutinized - and Eisenhower even 
established a commission to study - all national policies, goals, and ideals. 
[264] This White House-sanctioned introspection led to some criticism, not 
entirely constructive, of the civilian space agency, which all too often was 
equated with Project Mercury.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source2"><SUP>2</A></SUP>
<P>Most Americans appeared to approve Mercury as a potentially stupendous 
adventure, and many Congressmen anxiously hoped that NASA would mobilize the 
Nation's vaunted technological know-how to put the first man above the 
atmosphere. Although Dryden, George M. Low, and other NASA officials recently 
had warned repeatedly that the Russians could and likely would achieve manned 
space flight first, no one in NASA seemed to wonder whether the Soviets would 
send men on ballistic suborbital missions before committing a man to orbital 
flight. Most citizens seemed to confuse their feelings of hurt pride with loss 
of prestige and were reluctant to accept Eisenhower's difficult rationalization 
that America should abjure any "space race" with Soviet Russia. But NASA 
followed Eisenhower's leadership in this matter and reinforced the official 
attitude by insisting that Mercury was an "R and D" program whose pace could not 
be forced.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source3"><SUP>3</A></SUP>
<P>Glennan in his public statements appeared torn between the pressures of 
public sentiment expressed through Congress and the news media, on one hand, and 
the demands of loyalty to the Chief Executive and to technological realism, on 
the other. Aware of the Nation's late start in rocket propulsion development and 
yet of its amazingly rapid achievement of a workable ICBM, Glennan knew that the 
United States still did not have the weight-lifting prowess to join an avowed 
contest with the U.S.S.R. But Glennan also shared the aerospace community's 
satisfaction on May 20, 1960, when the Atlas first flew higher than 1,000 miles 
and over 9014 miles downrange from Cape Canaveral into the Indian Ocean. By this 
time the Thor and Jupiter intermediate-range missiles were operationally 
deployed abroad. The Titan ICBM, in spite of some developmental failures, was 
emerging into a second-generation intercontinental missile.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source4"><SUP>4</A></SUP>
<P>Mercury still was only a fractional part of NASA's total space effort, but 
publicity and public interest had reinforced each other until the manned program 
clearly had become the most promising hope of "beating" the Russians into space. 
When the Soviets orbited <I>Korabl Sputnik II</I> on August 19 and the next day 
recovered two dogs, Strelka and Belka, from it, grounds for complacency among 
Americans evaporated.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source5"><SUP>5</SUP> 
</A>National phobias, stimulated by partisan criticism of the alleged "missile 
gap," were further distorted by technological chauvinism with respect to Soviet 
accomplishments in space. Popular attitudes were exacerbated after the "spirit 
of Camp David" was destroyed by the U-2 incident and after Khrushchev used the 
U-2 affair to destroy the summit conference in Paris.
<P>Speculations on high policy and international relations were not the business 
of the field workers on the Mercury program. But as citizens they could not 
avoid being aware of some wondrous possibilities for the historic significance 
of their work. Both landlubbers and space lovers could find many excellent 
reasons to think that the ICBM and nuclear warheads might possibly become 
plowshares of peace rather than tools of terror if directed toward the 
exploration of space. [265] Peaceful coexistence and even international 
cooperation might be force-fed by the exorbitant economics of the competition to 
put men into orbit. Whatever one's particular brand of concern, there were 
motives aplenty to work on Project Mercury.
<P>Toward the end of June 1960, the Space Task Group took another hard look at 
the status of Project Mercury. Having formalized three separate series of 
engineering inspections and tests - progressing from development through 
qualification into reliability phases - STG faced with increased confidence some 
criticism from technical associates. It felt it could gauge accurately the soft 
spots in the major systems for Mercury. Of the 17 nominal systems for the 
capsule, all but five or six by June were reported finished with qualification 
tests and almost done with reliability testing. The major unfinished items were 
the reaction control system, pyrotechnics, the retrograde and posigrade rockets, 
and the satellite clock.
<P>Capsule system tests had revealed that certain pressure regulators, solenoid 
and relief valves, and thrust chambers for the reaction controls using corrosive 
hydrogen peroxide were going to be troublesome when operating in a high vacuum. 
On the other hand, the environmental system was progressing better than 
expected, with only five components still unqualified: the emergency oxygen 
bottle, a pressure reducer assembly, the odor and carbon dioxide absorber, a 
high-pressure oxygen transducer, and a suit-circuit water separator. The abort 
sensing and implementation system (ASIS) for the Atlas was 95 percent qualified, 
but its counterpart for the Redstone was not.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source6"><SUP>6</A></SUP>
<P>The communications and tracking network faced four outstanding problems: no 
one had much experience with Atlas guidance and tracking at long ranges and low 
elevation angles; the reliability of the high-speed data links was unknown; 
capsule antenna patterns were erratic enough to make radar acquisition 
problematic; and control procedures and techniques as yet were untried.
<P>Astronaut training, the Task Group believed, was virtually complete for 
disorientation, tumbling, and familiarization with high levels of carbon dioxide 
absorption. Adaptation to weightlessness and lectures on space sciences were 90 
percent complete, but training in navigation and communications (at reduced 
pressures and with high heating, noise, and vibration rates) was less than a 
third finished. The training of ground crews in procedures for preparing, 
launching, and monitoring an astronaut in flight had only just begun. And NASA's 
planning for recovery operations in the summer of 1960 was grandiose, asking 
"virtually for the deployment of the whole Atlantic fleet." This requirement 
came down abruptly after NASA met with the Navy at the Pentagon and was shown 
that fleet operations of this scope might cost more than the entire Mercury 
program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source7"><SUP>7</A></SUP>
<P>The climax of the debate over reliability analyses came in early summer 1960, 
when NASA Headquarters decided to issue an independent contract with McDonnell 
for making assurance doubly sure. Associate Administrator Richard E. Horner and 
his deputy, Nicholas E. Golovin, the mathematical systems analyst who had come 
to NASA from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, achieved [266] their first 
point on June 9, 1960, when a separate contract with McDonnell was signed for a 
reliability study of all Mercury capsule systems. Estimated to cost $52,892 with 
a fixed fee of $3,323 and planned to be administered by the Bureau of Naval 
Weapons representatives in St. Louis, this small contract was designed to 
provide Horner's office with the data it needed to analyze and evaluate the 
reliability efforts and achievements of McDonnell, of all 10 capsule 
subcontractors, of some 200 suppliers, and indirectly of STG's reliability 
monitoring and mission planning.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source8"><SUP>8</A></SUP>
<P>Golovin's approach to a reliability prediction program was unusual to both 
the Space Task Group and to many of his professional colleagues. It reversed the 
common procedure of beginning with parts analysis and proceeding to the whole 
system. Golovin had recently explained his theoretical point of view before the 
American Society for Quality Control, citing other missile program precedents 
for inverting the crucial problem: "start with a definition of failure for the 
system, and then work back through subsystems and components to the data on 
parts failures." Glennan and Horner had approved this approach as an aid to 
fulfilling their desires for better "confidence coefficients" before accepting 
the readiness of the capsule for unmanned and manned suborbital and three-orbit 
missions. This kind of systems analysis used deduction and fully exploited 
"numbers game" techniques and data processing machines to check on the inductive 
systems engineering of STG and McDonnell. The experimentalists at the working 
levels, and many of the engineering managers, including STG's Director, Robert 
R. Gilruth, believed they saw a worthless expenditure of effort in this 
innovation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>NASA Headquarters saw STG dragging its feet on this issue by the end of June. 
Glennan therefore tried another tack. He wrote directly to James S. McDonnell, 
shortly after a personal visit and briefing at the factory: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>As you know, during the last month there have been a number of 
  discussions between my Office of Reliability and Systems Analysis and various 
  members of your staff on the problem of Mercury capsule system reliability. 
  These talks were the result of my having directed the Office of Reliability 
  and Systems Analysis to prepare for me an objective quantitative evaluation of 
  the anticipated mission and flight safety reliability of the Mercury capsule 
  system. It has now been brought to my attention that discussions have not yet 
  resulted in mutual agreement on getting this job seriously underway.
  <P>I would appreciate it if you would give the matter your personal attention 
  and have your staff responsively consider providing, as promptly as possible, 
  the information detailed in the enclosed "Proposed Work Statements for 
  McDonnell on Mercury Capsule System Reliability."
  <P>If you foresee any serious problems in this connection, I would appreciate 
  your bringing them directly to my attention, and I will be glad to set up a 
  meeting in Washington to reach a full meeting of minds.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source10"><SUP>10</A></SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>The 
work statements enclosed in this letter, prepared by Golovin's assistants Landis 
S. Gephart, William Wolman, and Catherine D. Hock, called for precisely defined 
reliability definitions, assumptions, diagrams, equations, and estimates of each 
[267] subsystem design, together with all available test data from every source. 
The basic reasons for requesting this information were to allow NASA "to review 
and evaluate the techniques and the data employed by McDonnell" in its 
reliability report (No. 7007) issued almost a year earlier, and "to update and 
upgrade the reliability predictions and probability equations" for mission 
success in the light of uneven changes of component parts supplied to McDonnell: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>With all its subcontractors, McDonnell has established a 
  reliability requirement for each major equipment. This requirement has been 
  expressed either as a mean time between failures for a continuously operating 
  device or as a probability of success for a single shot device, and has been 
  incorporated as a firm contractual requirement in the appropriate McDonnell 
  Specification Control Drawing. McDonnell also recognizes that "a requirement 
  without a test to demonstrate compliance with it is meaningless." Accordingly, 
  McDonnell has specified a variety of tests aimed at demonstration of the 
  reliability requirements imposed on its subcontractors.</BLOCKQUOTE>Golovin and 
associates wanted to examine all test plans and test results on every Mercury 
capsule component from pre-installation acceptance through systems, 
compatibility, qualification, and life tests. In short, they wanted virtually a 
whole library of files at McDonnell opened for their inspection promptly, within 
two weeks if possible. This was not quite possible, but the founder of McDonnell 
Aircraft did reply personally to Administrator Glennan in mid-July: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am happy to inform you that our company started work on 9 June 
  1960, the same day on which Dr. William Wolman made his first specific 
  request, even though this request was only verbal [sic]. Our company is now at 
  work on every one of the programs therein outlined even though we still have 
  no contractual authorization for any of it.
  <P>
  <CENTER>* * * * * *</CENTER>
  <P>We are in full accord with providing as fast as humanly possible (without 
  diluting other Project Mercury effort) whatever work is desired by NASA to 
  assist in the reliability evaluations of Project Mercury. . . .<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source11"><SUP>11</A></SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>A 
few days later Golovin's group, having requested Silverstein to show STG how 
invidious was its prejudice against the "numbers game," journeyed down to 
Langley Field and briefed the Task Group on how Headquarters proposed to raise 
quality by quantitative methods. Reliability goals for each major capsule 
system, progressive analyses, and periodic reviews, plus a new order of 
simulated mission-testing stringency, were proposed and accepted by STG. Since 
the last major reliability meeting at Headquarters on February 29, 1960, had 
been so acrimonious, STG was surprised to find how little difference there now 
appeared to be between Golovin's approach to reliability and its own. On July 
21, Paul E. Purser logged this note for Gilruth: "Spent most of the day in the 
meeting with Dr. Golovin, et al. They sounded fairly reasonable. If we had held 
such a meeting several months ago, there would have been a lot less 
misunderstanding."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source12"><SUP>12</A></SUP>
<P>Shortly after this rapprochement, Horner resigned from NASA to go to 
industry, [268] Golovin resigned later to join the President's Science Advisory 
Committee staff, and Gephart and Hock obtained an expansion of the McDonnell 
reliability contract to cover the astronaut's task description and performance 
evaluation. Glennan meanwhile pressured Silverstein, who pressured Gilruth, to 
do something formal about taking into account contemporary mathematical 
techniques used in missile programs to enhance managerial confidence in 
reliability, hence in readiness before a launch. Gilruth in turn gave the job to 
John C. French, who proceeded to organize a "reliability and quality assurance 
office" in the Space Task Group. There was special significance in the word 
"assurance," because STG had by no means capitulated to the statistical approach 
nor to the mathematicians' belief in the efficacy of reliability prediction.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source13"><SUP>13</A></SUP>
<P>Had the qualification flight tests actually started earlier, perhaps much of 
the debate over what to expect from Mercury launches would have been obviated. 
But while still standing on the threshold of the major flight test program after 
almost two years of virtually simultaneous work on detailed design, engineering, 
and manufacturing, the Mercury spacecraft developers had to talk out some of 
these difficulties before they could call for a vote. Far more significant than 
the formal reliability program in the long run were the test philosophy, test 
programs, and the test work in "space chambers" that could more realistically 
simulate the hot/cold vacuum of the exospheric environment.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch9-1.htm#source14"><SUP>14</A></SUP> 
To move in that direction required a move toward the "spaceport" at Cape 
Canaveral, Florida.
