<H1>Big Joe Shot</H1>On the same day, September 9, 1959, both the major 
preliminary flight test of Project Mercury and the final qualification flight 
test of the operational Atlas ICBM occurred, in separate launches from opposite 
sides of the United States. While NASA and STG were focusing their attention on 
the performance of Atlas booster No. 10-D, being launched from Cape Canaveral, 
most of the men behind the Atlas were watching missile No. 12-D being launched 
from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. A novitiate crew of Strategic Air 
Command (SAC) officers and men had groomed No. 12-D for this critical test 
flight southwestward over the Pacific Missile Range. Likewise, neophytes from 
NASA stood by their payload on the Atlas 10-D, awaiting the results of its 
southeastward flight over the Atlantic Missile Range. If all went well this day, 
the Atlas would have proved itself capable both as an operational ICBM and as a 
launch vehicle for a Mercury ballistic flight. Reliability was something else 
again, but capability could be proved with one demonstration.
<P>[200] The men from Space Technology Laboratories; from Convair/Astronautics; 
Rocketdyne; General Electric; Pan American, who managed the "housekeeping" of 
the Atlantic Missile Range; and numerous other contractors supporting the Air 
Force development of the Atlas, deserved to be called experts. They had had 
experience in launching this rocket. By contrast, NASA personnel were even 
greener than the SAC crew going through the countdown at Vandenberg. NASA did 
not intend to learn to launch its own Atlases, but STG did hope to gain some 
expertise for living through its launches. The job of launching Big Joe belonged 
to the Air Force, supported by the Convair/Astronautics team at the Cape - Byron 
G. McNabb, Travis L. Maloy, Thomas J. O'Malley, C. A. Johnston, and others. 
Charles Mathews, the STG mission director, learned much about his operational 
requirements working with these men on Big Joe.
<P>Few people outside the military-industrial teams working on the Atlas could 
have known what was happening in the ICBM program in mid-1959.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source69"><SUP>69</A></SUP> 
The fourth and supposedly standard version of the Atlas ICBM, designated the 
Atlas D, rapidly supplanted the third development version, called Atlas C, 
during the summer of 1959. Earlier A and B models, fired in 1957 and 1958, had 
phased through C and into D concurrently. The Air Force had committed itself in 
December 1958 to supply NASA with standard Atlas Ds for all Mercury missions. 
The first installment on this commitment came due in September, at the same time 
that the weapon system was to prove itself operational. Since April 14, 1959, 
when the first series-D missile exploded 30 seconds after liftoff, only four 
other Atlas Ds had been launched, the second and third of which were partial 
failures or partial successes, depending upon one's point of view.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source70"><SUP>70</A></SUP>
<P>In July and August, however, the two successful Atlas-D launchings were 
supplemented by exceptionally encouraging flights of the last two series-C 
Atlases. Atlas 8-C had flown on July 21, bearing "RVX-2," or the first ablative 
reentry nose cone adapted to the Atlas. It was especially welcome to STG 
officials; both the flight and the recovery provided demonstrative evidence to 
reinforce STG's commitment to the ablation principle for the Mercury 
heatshield.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source71"><SUP>71</A></SUP>
<P>Joe is a common name, but there was nothing common about the big Atlas 
missile and the Mercury payload that stood poised upright at launch complex 14 
at Cape Canaveral on September 9, 1959. Some had hoped that Big Joe would 
skyrocket on July 4, but the launch date was postponed until mid-August by the 
Air Force because the booster did not check out perfectly at first. Then it was 
put off until early September by STG engineers, who were stymied by troubles in 
the sophisticated instrumentation and telemetry. Finally, on the evening of 
September 8, Atlas 10-D, the sixth of this model to be flight tested, stood on 
its launch pad at Cape Canaveral with a replica of the Mercury capsule (minus an 
escape tower) at its tip. All NASA waited for the countdown to begin at 
midnight. About a fourth of the Space Task Group members were at the Cape for 
the "Atlas ablation test." From this first full-scale, full-throttle simulation 
of the reentry problem, every member could expect further task definitions.
<P>[201] If Atlas 10-D should fail, if the boilerplate capsule should fail its 
test or be lost, then a backup shot, Big Joe II, would have to be made. But 
without proof that the ablation heatshield could actually protect a man from the 
intense frictional heat of reentry, and without dynamic evidence that the 
frustum-shaped spacecraft would actually align itself blunt-end-forward as it 
pierced the atmosphere, all the rest of the "R and D" invested in Faget's plan 
would avail little.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source72"><SUP>72</A></SUP>
<P>The nose-cone-capsule for Big Joe, handcrafted by NASA machinists, had no 
retrorocket package. The inner structure held only a half-size instrumented 
pressure vessel instead of a pressurized cabin contoured to the outer 
configuration. Built in two segments, the lower half by Lewis and the upper by 
Langley craftsmen, the main body of the spacecraft replica was fabricated of 
such relatively thin sheets of corrugated Inconel alloy in monocoque 
construction that the appellation "boilerplate" capsule was especially ironic.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source73"><SUP>73</A></SUP>
<P>For this model of the Mercury payload, more than a hundred thermocouples were 
installed around the capsule skin to register temperatures inside and under the 
heatshield, sides, and afterbody. Jacob Moser and a group of instrumentation 
specialists from Lewis had developed a multiplex system for transmitting data 
over a single telemetry link from all thermocouples plus 50 other instruments, 
including microphones, pressure gauges, and accelerometers.
<P>Back in Cleveland, three controls engineers, Harold Gold, Robert R. Miller, 
and H. Warren Plohr, had designed a "cold-gas" attitude control system, using 
high-pressure nitrogen for fuel. They had worked directly with 
Minneapolis-Honeywell to devise the gyros, logic, and thrusters for the critical 
about-face maneuver after separation. It was essentially unique in its use of 
cold-gas nitrogen thrusters rather than the "hot-gas" hydrogen peroxide systems 
that Bell Aerosystems had developed for the X-15 program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source74"><SUP>74</A></SUP>
<P>To STG novices watching the launch preparations, the Atlas and the 
organization of people it required to get off the ground seemed incredibly 
complex. But they themselves were not well organized even for their sole 
responsibility with the payload. Big Joe had three bosses, all at work under 
Mathews. Aleck C. Bond, the Langley heat-transfer specialist, had accepted from 
Faget almost a year ago the responsibility for the overall mission success. B. 
Porter Brown, the Langley engineer first sent to pave the way for STG at the 
Cape, acted as STG's chief liaison with the Air Force-Convair team. And Scott H. 
Simpkinson, leading the group of about 45 test-operations people from Lewis, had 
been living with the capsule for Big Joe in a corner of Hangar S since the 
second week in June, when checkout and preflight operations tests began. The 
NASA-Goddard crew still held most of the hangar space in preparation for 
<I>Vanguard III</I>, their culminating launch, scheduled later in September.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source75"><SUP>75</A></SUP>
<P>Porter Brown bore the title of NASA Atlas-Mercury Test Coordinator and worked 
- along with NASA Headquarters representative Melvin Gough - under nominal 
direction from the Missile Test Center. To fathom the complexity of launch 
operations and organizations at the Cape required expertise, tact, and drive. 
[202] Security restrictions were so strict for the Atlas, and agencies and 
launch crews so compartmentalized, that horizontal or interpersonal 
communications in the lower echelons were virtually nonexistent. Brown had to 
keep vertical communications open and establish STG's "need-to-know" at every 
step.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source76"><SUP>76</A></SUP>
<P>To launch a missile required a stack of documents almost as tall as a gantry. 
Documents called "preliminary requirements," "operations requirements," 
"operations directives," "test directives," and innumerable other coordinating 
catalogs had to be circulated and their orders followed before, during, and 
after getting a rocket off the ground. To active young engineers with a mission, 
this paperwork could only be frustrating, but Air Force experience had shown the 
value of the documentation system in imposing order on a chaotic situation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source77"><SUP>77</A></SUP>
<P>Atlas 10-D was programmed to rise, pitch over horizontally to the Atlantic 
before it reached its 100-mile peak altitude, then pitch down slightly before 
releasing its corrugated nose cone at a shallow angle barely below the 
horizontal. [203] In the near vacuum of space at that altitude, tiny automatic 
thrusters in the capsule should make it turn around for a shallow reentry into 
the stratosphere. The friction of the air, gradually braking the speed of the 
descent, would dissipate the kinetic energy imparted to the capsule by the 
Atlas. An incandescent cauldron of this transformed energy would envelop the 
capsule like a crucible as it penetrated denser air. It was hoped that enough of 
this heat would be deflected by the slip stream and boiled away into the 
turbulent boundary layer of the shock-wave to protect the capsule from 
vaporization. This flight should simulate closely what a man must ride through 
if he was to live to talk about an Atlas-boosted, Mercury-returned orbital 
flight around Earth.
<P>About 2:30 a.m., a 19-minute hold in the countdown was called to investigate 
a peculiar indication from the Burroughs computer that was to guide the launch. 
A malfunction was found in the Azusa impact prediction beacon, a transponder in 
the booster. Since there were several redundant means, including an IBM machine 
that was part of the range safety system, for predicting the impact point, the 
trouble was ignored, the countdown resumed, and liftoff occurred at 3:19 a.m.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source78"><SUP>78</A></SUP>
<P>It was a beautiful launch. The night sky lit up and the beach trembled with 
the roar of the Rocketdyne engines. For the first two minutes everyone was 
elated. Then suddenly oscillograph traces indicated that the two outboard 
booster engines had not separated from the centerline sustainer engine, as they 
were supposed to do when their fuel was exhausted. Flight controllers and test 
conductors in the blockhouse and control center began to worry about "BECO" (or 
booster engine cutoff) as contradictory signals appeared on their panels and 
computer readout rolls. Apparently all systems within the capsule were 
performing as planned, but the capsule seemed not to do its half-somersault. The 
added weight of the booster engines retarded velocity by 3,000 feet per second. 
The Burroughs computer predicted an impact point about 500 miles short. All 
eight reaction control jets seemed to be working perfectly, yet the reentry 
attitude could not be verified before the telemetry blackout occurred as the 
capsule skidded back into the atmosphere.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source79"><SUP>79</A></SUP> 
No one could ascertain what had happened during that 20-minute flight unless the 
recovery forces downrange could retrieve the capsule and its onboard tape 
recordings.
<P>Six ships of Destroyer Flotilla Four began racing uprange at flank speed. 
Patrol and tracking planes started flying their search patterns. Before dawn, 
tracking ships and downrange tracking stations detected the sofar bomb explosion 
underwater, and provided new coordinates for the point of impact. As the sun 
rose over the sea, a Navy P2V Neptune patrol plane, homing in on a sarah beacon 
signal, reported sighting the capsule bobbing in the water. It vectored the 
nearest destroyer, now still over 100 miles away, to the green-dyed area for 
retrieval. It was still too early to tell whether the primary objectives of Big 
Joe had been achieved. But as the morning progressed, more evidence from the 
range made it appear that all telemetry had functioned properly. If the capsule 
could be [204] recovered before it sank, the most important objective, finding 
out how well the capsule's ablation shield had endured reentry, could be 
evaluated quickly.
<P>While eager newsmen at the Cape were being cautioned to avoid erroneously 
identifying this custom-built prototype as the Mercury capsule, technicians were 
busily analyzing "quick-look" data that would give more information about 
booster and payload separation performance, the attitude control system, the 
internal and external temperature history of the model, noise and vibration 
levels, telemetry and tracking effectiveness, and acceleration and deceleration 
peaks.
<P>About seven hours after launch, exultation swept over the Big Joe launch team 
at the Cape when the destroyer <I>Strong</I> reported that she had netted the 
precious capsule intact and secured it on deck. The terrestrial return trip by 
water and air required another 12 hours. As soon as the transferring cargo plane 
arrived at Patrick Air Force Base, the capsule was loaded onto a dolly, and a 
police escort cleared the way for the shrouded trailer bearing the tangible 
remains of the Big Joe mission along the 15 miles through Cocoa Beach to Cape 
Canaveral.
<P>When the capsule arrived back home in Hangar S, about midnight, every NASA 
person at the launch site that day gathered around the capsule for a joyous 
autopsy. Gilruth, Faget, Mathews, Bond, Brown, and Simpkinson stood by as 
someone dropped the canvas veiling the secret heatshield. The group marveled at 
the superb condition of their archetype. Bond ran his fingers over the now cool 
glass beads on the face of the ablation shield, noticed that the afterbody was 
barely singed. Brown scratched the white-paint legend "United States" and found 
it hardly discolored. Although one of the afterbody recovery eyes was welded 
shut by reentry heating, a piece of masking tape, which Simpkinson had allowed 
to remain, was still intact inside the outer conical shell. A tired but happy 
crew unscrewed the two halves of the inner pressure vessel and handed to Gilruth 
a letter that had been sealed inside and signed by 53 people under Mathews in 
anticipation of this occasion: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This note comes to you after being transported into space during 
  the successful flight of the "Big Joe" capsule, the first full-scale flight 
  operation associated with Project Mercury. The people who have worked on this 
  project hereby send you greetings and congratulations.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source80"><SUP>80</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>Within 
a week, data reduction made possible the reconstruction of the inflight history 
of Big Joe. As suspected, the outboard engines had failed to stage after booster 
engine cutoff, and the additional weight degraded the Atlas velocity about 3,000 
feet per second. This meant the trajectory of the flight path had been steeper 
and slightly lower than planned and that the sustainer engine had powered the 
capsule into a steeper downward course before burnout. Without a positive force 
to divide the two objects in free fall, the capsule had separated from the 
booster about 138 seconds late, after all of its high-pressure nitrogen fuel was 
expended in trying futilely to turn both booster and spacecraft around for 
reentry. When it finally broke loose from the launch vehicle at an altitude 
[205] of 345,000 feet and at a space-fixed speed of almost 15,000 miles per 
hour, the capsule was an exhausted, passive, free-falling body. Yet by virtue of 
its configuration and center of gravity, the capsule turned itself around 
without the aid of either thrusters or damping controls and reentered the 
atmosphere successfully. The dynamic stability of the capsule configuration was 
so good that doubt of its ability to damp out its entry oscillations was also 
ended.
<P>The heat pulse sustained in the actual Big Joe trajectory was shorter but 
considerably more severe than planned. If STG had been testing a beryllium heat 
sink shield, these untoward conditions would not have proved anything. For the 
ablation heatshield, the length of the heat pulse was sufficient to prove the 
value of the approach. The sequencing, structures, instrumentation, and cooling 
system had all worked well. The recovery of the capsule inspired so much 
confidence among STG leaders that Big Joe II, the backup launch, was canceled 
within three weeks.
<P>[206] Cores and slices taken from the conservatively designed heatshield at 
many locations proved that the heating was uniform over its face and that its 
structural integrity had survived impact without compromise. The depth of 
ablation charring was shallow enough to leave at least two-thirds of the 
fiber-glass material in pristine condition. Bond and Andre J. Meyer were 
especially pleased with the large margin for error represented by the thickness 
of the heatshield remaining. Subsequently, they were able to reduce the 
thickness and the weight of the shield by almost one half.
<P>One note of caution remained in all the jubilation following Big Joe. Leonard 
Rabb, the head of Faget's theoretical heat transfer section, signed a memo on 
October 7 demanding action to prove that the short heat pulse on Big Joe could 
be disregarded. "Calculations indicate," said Rabb, "that the present Mercury 
heatshield will <I>not</I> survive a reentry due to natural decay." If 
retrorockets should be lost or become inoperative and if the ablation shield in 
orbit should have to sustain and dissipate the long, slow building of the heat 
pulse over 24 hours or so, catastrophe would result, Rabb warned: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Under no circumstances should the weight of the heat shield itself 
  be shaved. Recent calculations cast doubt on the shield's performance, not 
  only for natural decay reentry but for the one retro [rocket instead of three 
  or two] case as well.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source81"><SUP>8l</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>By 
the end of October, the working papers giving the results of Big Joe were 
published, and gradually the lessons learned from this shot were incorporated in 
a number of major redesign decisions. The features that became standard for 
Project Mercury as a result of Big Joe have been summarized by Aleck Bond: 
<OL>
  <LI>In view of the excellent performance of the ablation shield, the back-up 
  beryllium heat sink shield was dropped from further consideration for Mercury 
  orbital missions. 
  <LI>The basic heat shield fabrication techniques employed for the Big Joe 
  shield were adopted for the Mercury heat shield. 
  <LI>The detailed temperature measurements made on the Big Joe shield provided 
  for an efficient design thickness for the Mercury shield. 
  <LI>The afterbody heat transfer measurements indicated a need for heavier 
  external thermal protection than had been provided for the Mercury spacecraft, 
  and as a result the shingles on the conical afterbody were thickened and on 
  the cylindrical afterbody the original René shingles were replaced with the 
  thick beryllium shingles in order to handle the high heating loads in this 
  region.
  <P>
  <CENTER>* * * *</CENTER>
  <P>The ability of the spacecraft to survive the severe test of reentry from 
  near-orbital velocities in spite of its unprecedented release conditions, is 
  certainly worthy of note. The heat shield performance was excellent and the 
  results indicated that the original design concepts were sound. The spacecraft 
  performance as a freebody reentry vehicle was exceptional. An important 
  characteristic of the Mercury design was demonstrated; that the spacecraft 
  could [208] reenter the atmosphere at high angles of attack and maintain the 
  heat shield forward attitude without the aid of a control system!<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-6.htm#source82"><SUP>82</A></SUP></P></LI></OL>The 
elation of the Task Group over the dynamic proof of its passive design of 
Mercury was not shared by the Atlas people. Their booster 10-D, having failed to 
stage, performed only marginally and in fact was classed a failure by the Air 
Force and STL. But across the country, on the Pacific Coast, Atlas 12-D, 
launched by the SAC crew under the tutelage of Convair/Astronautics and STL, 
performed as a true ICBM on a 5,200-mile flight to its target in the South 
Pacific. Immediately thereafter the Air Force announced the Atlas was now 
operational. Apparently the force-in-being totaled only the two missiles erected 
in training gantries at Vandenberg, but the delicate balance of power could not 
wait for the buildup of numbers.<A
