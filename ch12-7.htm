<H1>Chimpanzee into Orbit</H1>By mid-October, reported George Low to NASA 
Headquarters, problems with capsule No. 9 and booster No. 93-D had forced STG to 
delay the launch from November 7 to November 14. On November 11, however, after 
the preflight checkout crew found a hydrogen peroxide leak in the fuel line of 
the capsule manual control system, the earliest possible launch date slipped to 
November 29.<A

Although NASA did not comment officially on the effect of the delay, chances for 
a manned orbital mission in 1961 now were dim.<A

<P>On November 28, 1961, an 11 1/2-hour launch preparation count began for MA-5. 
The count stopped at T minus 390 minutes, to be resumed the next day. Some 11 
hours before the launch, Enos, the 39-pound chimpanzee, underwent his final 
physical examination, stood still as his medical sensors were taped on, allowed 
himself to be secured in the specially constructed primate couch, and rode in 
the transfer van to the gantry. About 5 hours before launch the couch [403] was 
inserted in the spacecraft. Thereafter Enos' condition was monitored by lines 
connected to his couch in the Mercury capsule and by radio telemetry. He was 
relaxed during countdown. His temperature ranged from 97.8 to 98.4 degrees, 
normal for the suit inlet temperature of about 65 degrees; his respiration 
averaged 14; and his pulse rate was 94. The only time Enos displayed agitation 
was when he was roused by the opening of the hatch during a countdown hold 
caused by a telemetry link failure at T minus 30 minutes. The gantry was hauled 
back to the spacecraft, the hatch was opened, and an off-and-on switch was 
correctly positioned. This hold lasted 85 minutes. Some members in the control 
center joked that Enos had turned the switch off because he had talked to Ham 
and did not want to go.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source52"><SUP>52</A></SUP>
<P>In the Mercury Control Center the flight control monitors had manned their 
stations and were busily checking out their consoles. Tecwyn Roberts, serving as 
flight dynamics officer, noted the intermittent problems cropping up in the 
data-gathering and translating computers. A faulty transistor in the direct data 
receiver caused one hold, and when the replacement was also faulty, several more 
minutes were lost in repairing the computer. Morton Schler, the capsule 
environment monitor, reported that the environmental control system was working 
smoothly. The Freon flow rate, he reported, leveled at a comfortable 20 pounds 
per hour in the prelaunch period. From the oxygen partial-pressure transducer 
some erratic readings proved erroneous; Mercury Control teletyped the tracking 
stations to discount these readings as the spacecraft passed over.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source53"><SUP>53</A></SUP>
<P>Holds during the countdown amounted to almost 2 hours and 38 minutes. Shortly 
after the hatch was bolted at T minus 90 minutes, the technicians discovered 
that they had failed to install some hatch cover heat insulation material. They 
took a little more than an hour to correct this oversight. Then, at T minus 30 
minutes, the discovery of an improperly positioned switch necessitated the 
85-minute hatch-opening hold. And finally, at T minus 15 minutes, a 4-minute 
hold was called to correct a data-link problem between Mercury Control and the 
General Electric ground command guidance equipment.
<P>Walter Williams, the mission director, listened as the various difficulties 
arose and became somewhat agitated at the chain of events. Although his usual 
position during such times was at a console in the mission control center, he 
left the building and quickly drove the distance to pad 14 to personally express 
his expectations that things would proceed in a more orderly manner. As a member 
of Convair later said, "Williams was a master in imparting a need for orderly 
urgency."
<P>Despite these holds, weather conditions remained favorable. Only a few thin 
cirrus clouds hung in the sky, visibility was 10 miles, and the surface wind 
velocity was at a moderate 11 miles per hour from the northwest. In the landing 
area the weather was even better.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source54"><SUP>54</A></SUP>
<P>The Goddard computers received the liftoff signal 13 seconds before the 
booster actually rose from the pad, an error apparently caused by feedback 
between two recorders. Nor was this the last incorrect signal. [404] The Goddard 
computers registered sustainer engine cutoff twice before that event happened, 
once shortly after liftoff and again two minutes after launch. In each case the 
Mercury Control Center had to switch to override the signal until the panel 
indicator cleared.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source55"><SUP>55</A></SUP> 
Liftoff came at 10:08 a.m. The powered phase of the flight went well, although 
there were minor discrepancies. Between liftoff and staging, the horizon-scanner 
signal was lost briefly. All spacecraft systems nevertheless appeared to be 
working normally, with the guidance system of the Atlas keeping the booster on 
an almost perfect insertion trajectory. Guidance system noise was only about 
half that recorded during MA-4, and vehicular vibration also was much lower. 
Four and a half minutes after launch, Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., unhesitatingly 
made the go-for-orbit decision. At sustainer engine cutoff, the velocity, flight 
angle, and altitude were nearly perfect. The Atlas hurled the spacecraft into an 
orbit with a perigee of about 99 miles and an apogee of 147 miles, .5 and 5.4 
miles low, respectively.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source56"><SUP>56</A></SUP>
<P>Spacecraft and booster separation occurred precisely as planned, while the 
turnaround maneuver took less than 30 seconds. The capsule's position excursions 
were very slight, which contrasted sharply with the erratic turnaround of MA-4. 
The spacecraft quickly dropped into its 34-degree orbit mode and began streaking 
over the oceans and continents. Of the 61.5 pounds of control fuel aboard, 
turnaround and damping had consumed 6 pounds, as opposed to 9.5 for MA-4. From 
that point and on through the first orbit the thrusters used only 1.5 pounds to 
maintain a correct position, with the automatic stabilization and control system 
functioning perfectly.
<P>The environmental control system and the tracking and communications network 
performed in a satisfactory fashion. On this mission, for the first time, the 
primary and secondary oxygen bottles were pressurized at 7,500 pounds per square 
inch (the design specification) rather than at 3,000, as on previous flights. A 
functioning water separator also was used for the first time. Each tracking 
station's range on the ultra-high-frequency band lasted for about six minutes; 
on high frequency, overlap communications between stations were similar to that 
experienced during MA-4. The Goddard computers received valid telemetry data 
from all stations except Woomera, but there were instances when communications 
were momentarily lost at particular stations. Just before retrofire, for 
example, Point Arguello, the site giving the firing command, lost contact with 
the Cape. In each instance, as Walter Williams would point out at the postflight 
press conference, communications were reestablished whenever that particular 
station was needed.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source57"><SUP>57</A></SUP>
<P>Enos, the orbiting chimpanzee, fared well. He withstood a peak of 6.8 g 
during booster-engine acceleration and 7.6 g with the rush of the sustainer 
engine. He had been performing his lever-pulling duties for some two minutes 
before the Atlas roared and rose from the pad. During his two orbits he made 29 
pulls (divided among four sessions) on the continuous-avoidance and 
discrete-avoidance levers, receiving only one shock in each category. On his 
second problem, which [405] required at least a 20-second delayed response to 
receive a drink of water, his average delay was about 33.8 seconds. For these 
labors he was rewarded with a total of 47 measures of water, or about a pint 
during the three-hour mission. For the fixed-ratio task, problem three, Enos 
pumped his lever and received 13 banana pellets during his four opportunities. 
On the first session of problem Four, Enos was correct for 18 out of 28 symbol 
presentations (64.2 percent), thus receiving 10 shocks as a result of his 
miscues. On the second session of problem four, however, the center lever 
malfunctioned, causing shocks even if he pulled the correct lever. He received 
36 and 43 successive shocks on the third and fourth sessions, respectively, 
because a manmade device had failed. The shocked and frustrated chimpanzee 
nevertheless kept pulling the levers. As he was also trained to do, Enos 
remained at rest during the six-minute intervals between problems.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source58"><SUP>58</A></SUP>
<P>Near the end of the first orbit, the tracking monitors noted that the capsule 
clock was about 18 seconds too fast and as it passed over the Cape a corrective 
command was dispatched to and accepted by the clock. At that time the Mercury 
Control Center display panels indicated that all spacecraft systems were in good 
order. Suddenly the Atlantic tracking ship reported that inverter temperatures 
were rising. The Canary Island trackers confirmed the environmental control 
system malfunction. Since abnormal heating had occurred on earlier flights and 
the inverters had continued working or had switched to standby, there was no 
alarm among members at Mercury Control. Then, across the world from the Cape, 
Muchea, Australia, detected high thruster signals and capsule motion excursions, 
although other data indicated that the 34-degree orbit mode was being 
maintained. The Woomera, Australia, tracking station failed to confirm this 
report, and it was discounted.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source59"><SUP>59</A></SUP>
<P>By the time the MA-5 capsule reached the vicinity of the Canton Island 
station, the operations team realized that the attitude control system was 
allowing the vehicle to go out of its proper orbital mode. A metal chip in a 
fuel supply line (the postflight inspection would reveal) had cut off the 
propellant flow to one of the clockwise roll thrusters. This inactive thruster 
allowed the spacecraft to drift minus 30 degrees from its normal attitude, at 
which point the automatic stabilization and control system brought the 
spacecraft to zero in a normal roll-turn maneuver. Then the spacecraft swung 
briefly back into the nominal 34-degree orbital attitude, and the sequence 
started again. The spacecraft repeated this process of drift and correction nine 
times before retrofire and once more between retrofire and the receipt of the 
.05-g light telemetry signal. The still-active thrusters used about 9.5 pounds 
of control fuel working to keep the capsule properly aligned. Each loss of orbit 
mode cost a little over a pound of fuel compared with a first-orbit expenditure 
of only 1.5 pounds.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source60"><SUP>60</A></SUP>
<P>The cooling equipment in the environmental control system also began to give 
trouble during the second orbit. Between the Canary Islands and Kano, the suit 
circuit temperature rose rapidly from 65 to 80 degrees, indicating a freezing 
condition in the heat exchanger. As water in the felt evaporator pad of the 
[406] exchanger turned to ice, Enos' body temperature climbed to 99, then to 100 
degrees. The medical observers began to worry, especially about the chimp's 
ability to handle his psychomotor test problems. Then, at 100.5 degrees, his 
body temperature appeared to stabilize, suggesting that the environmental system 
was ceasing to overheat. Their fears relieved, the physicians felt that the 
mission could continue. Although the cooling system had seemed to correct 
itself, Kraft, the flight director, later remarked that a deicing unit should be 
added to warm the troublesome unit, which had also caused a freeze-up on MA-4.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source61"><SUP>61</A></SUP> 
Although the medical monitors were willing to allow the mission to proceed 
through its scheduled third pass around the world, the operations team believed 
that the problem of the spacecraft's erratic attitude was too grave to live 
with. The engineers felt that there simply was not enough attitude fuel left to 
complete the circuit and then go through the reentry phase, in which, even under 
normal circumstances, fuel usage would be high.
<P>After the attitude aberrations were first noted, Kraft had alerted the 
tracking unit in Hawaii for a possible clock change to initiate retrofire during 
the second orbit. Then he decided to continue the flight toward California and 
notified Gordon Cooper at Point Arguello that that station might have to 
initiate a ground command for retrofire. Meanwhile, the capsule continued to 
drift and swing in and out of the orbital mode, demonstrating that the attitude 
control system, unlike the environmental control system, would not solve its own 
problems. Twelve seconds before the retrofire point was reached for the normal 
second-orbit primary recovery point, Kraft decided to bring Enos back to Earth. 
Arnold Aldrich, MSC's chief flight controller at Point Arguello, correctly 
executed the command.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source62"><SUP>62</A></SUP>
<P>With the exception of the one repeated variation in attitude position, caused 
by the dead roll thruster, reentry went according to plan. The destroyers 
<I>Stormes</I> and <I>Compton</I> and a P5M airplane began preparing for 
spacecraft retrieval in Station 8, the predicted impact point. Three hours and 
13 minutes after launch and about nine minutes from water impact, the P5M 
spotted the descending spacecraft at an altitude of about 5000 feet and radioed 
the <I>Stormes</I> and the <I>Compton</I>, 30 miles away. All spacecraft 
recovery aids except the sarah beacon functioned properly. During the 
spacecraft's descent, the airplane circled and reported landing events, then 
remained in the area until the <I>Stormes</I> arrived, an hour and 15 minutes 
after the landing, and hauled Enos and his spacecraft aboard. Shortly thereafter 
the hatch was explosively released from outside the capsule by a pull on its 
lanyard, causing the chimp's "picture" window to crack.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source63"><SUP>63</A></SUP>
<P>Aboard the <I>Stormes</I> and later at Cape Canaveral, Manned Spacecraft 
Center and McDonnell engineers gave the capsule the usual close scrutiny and 
happily found that it had held up well. Except for a slight discoloration caused 
by aerodynamic heating, the exterior showed no buckling or warping. The interior 
was in good shape, too, although the inspectors did find a small amount of salt 
water. Activation of the explosive hatch caused minor damage in the form [407] 
of the cracked window, several bolts pulled from the skin, and a slight buckle. 
Thermodynamic effects on the ablation heatshield had produced several radial and 
circular cracks, none of which had been severe enough to threaten the capsule's 
structural integrity. The center plug of the heatshield was missing (it had only 
worked loose on MA-4 ), but close inspection of the opening showed that the plug 
had evidently been in place during reentry. Condition of the impact bag, which 
had survived its first orbital test, was fairly good, although several straps 
were broken and others were severely bent. Again the plastic bulkhead was 
pierced, probably by the heatshield, and the honeycomb material was crushed in 
several places. There was no damage to the tubing or wiring in this area.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch12-7.htm#source64"><SUP>64</A></SUP>
<P>At the Cape postflight press conference the leaders of Project Mercury 
revealed no regrets over missing a third orbit. They seemed to regard the 
reprogramming operation, conducted in the middle of the mission, as a satisfying 
technical accomplishment. In view of the decisiveness with which the various 
potentially critical difficulties had been overcome or circumvented, MA-5 had to 
be termed an excellent operation, one that had achieved most of its objectives 
and that would become a milestone on the road into the unknown.
<P>Enos had been weightless for 181 minutes and had performed his psychomotor 
duties with aplomb. Operations director Williams felt that an astronaut riding 
in the MA-5 spacecraft could have made the necessary corrections in flight to 
complete the three-orbit mission normally. On the spacecraft attitude control 
problem, for example, a man could simply have switched from automatic to manual 
mode, he said. At the same time, Williams was pleased that the automatic systems 
had worked well for over two hours. Equally significant, the vast network of 
NASA, military, and industry personnel had performed like veterans during the 
emergency. The spacecraft had reentered and landed without handing the Navy any 
unexpected recovery problems.
