<H1>NACA Moves Toward Space</H1>In the early 1950s, however, as a full-fledged 
program to develop large ballistic missiles got underway and as the rocket 
research airplanes reached higher into the stratosphere, NACA began to consider 
the prospect of space flight and what contributions the organization could make 
in this new area of inquiry. On June 24, 1952, the Committee on Aerodynamics, 
the most influential of NACA's various technical committees, met at Wallops 
Island. Toward the end of the meeting, committee member Robert J. Woods, the 
highly respected designer of "X" aircraft for the Bell Aircraft Corporation, 
suggested that since various groups and agencies were considering proposals for 
sending manned and unmanned vehicles into the upper atmosphere, NACA should set 
up a study group on "space flight and associated problems." To Woods, NACA was 
the logical agency to conduct research in spacecraft stability and control; such 
work would be a proper extension of current NACA activity. After some discussion 
the other members of the committee approved Woods' suggestion. They formally 
resolved that NACA should intensify its research on flight at altitudes between 
12 and 50 miles and at speeds of mach 4 through 10, and "devote a modest effort 
to problems associated with unmanned and manned flight at altitudes from 50 
miles to infinity and at speeds from Mach number 10 to the velocity of escape 
from the earth's gravity." On July 14 the NACA Executive Committee, the 
governing body of NACA, composed of practically all the members of the Main 
Committee, approved a slightly revised version of this resolution.<A

<P>Less than a month after the action of the Executive Committee, [57] Henry J. 
E. Reid, Director of the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, appointed Clinton E. 
Brown, Charles H. Zimmerman, and William J. O'Sullivan, aeronautical engineers 
at the Virginia center, to work up a thorough proposal for research in 
upper-atmospheric and space flight. Specifically the Langley engineers were to 
suggest a suitable manned vehicle on which construction could be initiated 
within two years. Their proposal was to be reviewed by a board composed of 
representatives from the three NACA laboratories and NACA's High Speed Flight 
Station at Edwards Air Force Base, California.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-2.htm#source7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
<P>Throughout the next year and a half, the Langley study group, engineers at 
Ames and the flight station, and the review board worked on a plan for the new 
research instrument. There was wide divergence of opinion as to what should be 
the nature and objectives of the vehicle; some parties were even skeptical about 
the wisdom of any space-directed research. Reid, John Stack, and others at 
Langley favored modifying the X-2 research airplane, then under development by 
Bell Aircraft, to make it a device for manned flight above 12 miles.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-2.htm#source8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
Smith J. DeFrance, one of the early Langley engineers who had become Director of 
the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory when it opened in 1941, originally opposed 
Woods' idea for a study group on space flight because "it appears to verge on 
the developmental, and there is a question as to its importance. There are many 
more pressing and more realistic problems to be met and solved in the next ten 
years." DeFrance had concluded in the spring of 1952 that "a study group of any 
size is not warranted."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-2.htm#source9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>In July 1954, however, representatives of NACA disclosed to the Air Force and 
the Navy their conclusions regarding the feasibility of an entirely new 
rocket-powered research airplane and suggested a tripartite program for the 
manned exploration of the upper atmosphere. NACA's views were based mainly on 
the findings and proposals of the Langley study group, which had been working on 
the problem since 1952 and had made a more detailed presentation than research 
teams from Ames and the High Speed Flight Station. NACA envisioned an aircraft 
that would fly as high as 50 miles and whose speed would reach perhaps mach 7 
(approximately 5,000 miles per hour). Such a craft would be especially valuable 
for studying the critical problems of aerodynamic heating, stability, and 
control at high altitudes and speeds. Data gathered on its flights "would 
contribute both to air-breathing supersonic aircraft . . . and to long-range 
high altitude rocket-propelled vehicles operating at higher Mach numbers." 
Realizing that the temperatures generated on its return into the heavier 
atmosphere would be greater than on any previous airplane, NACA suggested as a 
structural metal Inconel-X, a new nickel-chrome alloy "capable of rapid heating 
to high temperatures (1,200&deg;F) without the development of high thermal stresses, 
or thermal buckling, and without appreciable loss of strength or stiffness."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-2.htm#source10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
<P>This long-range plan was shortly accepted by the Air Force and the Navy 
Bureau of Aeronautics and put into motion as the "X-15 project." In December 
1954, NACA, the Air Force, and the Navy agreed to proceed with the project [58] 
under operating arrangements roughly similar to the previous "X" aircraft 
ventures. The Air Force had responsibility for finding a contractor and 
supervising design and construction; both the Air Force and the Navy would 
provide financial support; and NACA would act as technical director.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-2.htm#source11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>As prime contractor for the X-15, the Air Force picked North American 
Aviation of Los Angeles. The performance specifications of the X-15 called for a 
rocket engine consuming anhydrous ammonia and liquid oxygen and providing some 
57,000 pounds of thrust for as long as six minutes. This powerplant would be 
four times as big as that of the X-2. A highly sensitive flight-data system, 
thick upper and lower vertical stabilizers for aerodynamic control, small 
reaction jets burning hydrogen peroxide for control in the near-vacuum of the 
upper atmosphere, and a new structural material - these were some of the novel 
characteristics of the stub-winged craft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-2.htm#source12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>The X-15 would not fulfill its original design objectives until 1962, long 
after NACA had become NASA and in the same year that Project Mercury achieved 
its basic goals. Even so, the X-15 was by far the most ambitious, expensive, and 
publicized research undertaking in which NACA ever participated. Its eventual 
success stemmed largely from the imagination and ingenuity of the NACA engineers 
who had started planning for an advanced aerodynamic vehicle in 1952.
<P>In 1954, the year of Major Arthur Murray's climb to about 17 miles in the 
X-1A, the idea of manned rocket flight to an altitude of 50 miles seemed 
exceedingly visionary. Most people in NACA, the military, the aircraft industry, 
and elsewhere assumed that over the years vehicles with substantial lift/drag 
ratios would evolve to higher and higher speeds and altitudes until, by skipping 
in and out of the atmosphere like a flat rock across the surface of a pond, they 
could fly around the world. Even then, however, there were those within NACA who 
took the Executive Committee's mandate for "research in space flight and 
associated problems" literally and who felt that the X-15 concept did not go far 
enough. They looked to the second part of the resolution adopted by the 
Committee on Aerodynamics and approved by the Executive Committee, which 
sanctioned "a modest effort" on the "problems associated with flight at 
altitudes from 50 miles to infinity and at speeds from Mach number 10 to the 
velocity of escape from the earth's gravity."
<P>Some of the most "far out" aeronautical engineers working for NACA in the 
early fifties were employed at the Ames laboratory. As early as the summer of 
1952, Ames engineers, experimenting at the supersonic free-flight, 
10-inch-by-14-inch, and 6-inch-by-6-inch wind tunnels at the California site, 
had examined the aerodynamic problems of five kinds of space vehicles - glide, 
skip, ballistic, satellite, and interplanetary. They knew that the aerodynamic 
forces acting on a vehicle above 50 miles were relatively minor, as were 
problems of stability and control at such altitudes. They concluded, however, 
that a space vehicle should probably be controllable at lower altitudes, 
although it "may not be optimum from the point of view of simplicity, etc...."<A
