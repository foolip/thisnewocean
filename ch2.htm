<P>[33] The development of the large liquid-fueled rocket
made the dazzling prospect of manned flight beyond Earth's atmosphere and into
the vacuum of space increasingly feasible from the standpoint of propulsion. By
1950, however, only instrumented sounding rockets, fired to ever higher
altitudes in both the United States and the Soviet Union, had reached into space
before falling earthward. Although a number of these experimental shots carried
living organisms - everything from fungus spores to monkeys in the United
States, mainly dogs in the U.S.S.R. - the data acquired from telemetry and from
occasional recovery of rocket nose cones had not shown conclusively how long
organisms could live in space, or indeed whether man could survive at all
outside the protective confines of his atmosphere. Scientists still were
hesitant to predict how a human being would behave under conditions to be
encountered in space flight. Thus while space flight became technologically
practicable, physiologically and psychologically it remained an enigma.
<P>In the early 1950s an acceleration of efforts in upper-atmospheric and space
medical research accompanied the quickened pace of rocket development in this
country and in the Soviet Union. During the next few years medical specialists,
profiting from substantial progress in telemetering clinical data, learned a
great deal about what a man could expect when he went into the forbidding arena
of space.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
Much of the confidence with which the engineers of Project Mercury in 1958
approached the job of putting a man into orbit and recovering him stemmed from
the findings of hundreds of studies made in previous years on the human factors
in space flight.
<P>Since the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was interested almost
exclusively in the technology of flight, research in the medical problems of
space flight, like aviation medicine in previous decades, was the province
primarily of the military services and of some civilian research organizations
receiving funds from the military. Of the three services, the United States Air
Force, rich in background in aeromedical research and assuming that space
medicine was but [34] an extension of aviation medicine, undertook most of the
early inquiry into the psychophysiological problems of extra-atmospheric flight.

<H3>Beginnings of Space Medicine</H3>After the Second World War the Air Force
acquired the talents of a number of scientists who had done much remarkable
research on the medical aspects of high-speed, high-altitude airplane flight for
Germany's Luftwaffe.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
Most of these German physicians, physiologists, and psychologists were brought
to the expanding Aeromedical Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near
Dayton, Ohio. Six of the more prominent German aeromedical specialists, Hubertus
Strughold, Hans-Georg Clamann, Konrad Buettner, Siegfried J. Gerathewohl, and
the brothers Fritz and Heinz Haber, were assigned as research physicians to the
Air Force School of Aviation Medicine, located on the scrub prairies of south
central Texas at Randolph Air Force Base, outside San Antonio. The commandant of
the school was Colonel Harry G. Armstrong, author of the classic text in
aviation medicine.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
While heavily instrumented V-2s lumbered upward from White Sands and plastic
research balloons lifted seeds, mice, hamsters, fruit flies, and other specimens
into the upper atmosphere, Armstrong and his associates were already considering
the medical implications of flight by man into the hostile space environment.
<P>In November 1948, Armstrong organized at Randolph a panel discussion on the
"Aeromedical Problems of Space Travel." Featuring papers by Strughold and Heinz
Haber and commentary by six well-known scientists from universities and the
military, the symposium perhaps marked the beginning of formal, academic inquiry
into the medical hazards of extra-atmospheric flight. Before this epochal
gathering ended, Strughold had resolved the contradiction inherent in the title
of the symposium by emphatically using the term "space medicine."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<P>The following February, Armstrong set up the world's first Department of
Space Medicine, headed by Strughold and including the Habers and Konrad
Buettner.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
In November 1951, at San Antonio, the School of Aviation Medicine and the
privately financed Lovelace Foundation for Medical Research at Albuquerque, New
Mexico, sponsored a symposium discreetly entitled "Physics and Medicine of the
Upper Atmosphere." It was still not respectable to speak plainly of space flight
within the Air Force, which only that year had cautiously reactivated its
intercontinental ballistic missile project and remained sensitive to "Buck
Rogers" epithets from members of Congress and the taxpaying public. A good
portion of the material presented by the 44 speakers at the 1951 symposium,
however, covered the nature of space, the mechanics of space flight, and the
medical difficulties of sending a man beyond the sensible and breathable
atmosphere.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>

<P>It was at this meeting that Strughold, later to acquire a reputation as the
"father of space medicine," put forth what is perhaps his most notable
contribution - the concept of "aeropause," a region of "space-equivalent
conditions" or [35] "atmospheric space equivalence." Strughold pointed out that
while many astronomers, astrophysicists, and meteorologists set the boundary
between the atmosphere and space at about 600 miles from Earth, the biological
conditions of space begin much lower, at about 50,000 feet. Anoxia is
encountered at 50,000 feet, the boiling point of body fluids at 63,000 feet, the
necessity for carrying all respiratory oxygen within a manned compartment at
80,000 feet, meteoroids at 75 miles, and the darkness of the space "void" at 100
miles. Above 100 miles the atmosphere is imperceptible to the flyer. "What we
call upper atmosphere in the physical sense," said Strughold, "must be considered
- in terms of biology - as space in its total form." Hence manned ballistic or
orbital flight at an altitude of 100 miles would be, for all practical purposes,
space flight.<A

<P class="caption">An important bridge from aviation medicine to space
medicine was this chart by Hubertus Strughold in 1951. It related altitudes at
which human functional borders occur with the altitudes at which the various
physical characteristics of space occur.</P>
</DIV>

<P>The rocket-powered research airplanes of the postwar years, beginning with
the X-1, the first manned vehicle to surpass the speed of sound, took American
test pilots well into the region of space equivalence. On August 26, 1954, when
Major Arthur Murray of the Air Force pushed the Bell X-1A to an altitude of [36]
90,000 feet, he was above 90 percent of the sensible atmosphere. Two years
later, in the more powerful Bell X-2, Air Force Captain Iven Kincheloe climbed
to 126,000 feet, "a space-equivalent flight to a very high degree."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
The X-15, still on the drawing boards in the mid-fifties, was being designed to
rocket its pilot to an altitude of 50 miles at nearly seven times the speed of
sound. And human-factors research in the X-15 project, involving the development
and testing of a new full-pressure flying suit, centrifuge conditioning to high
acceleration forces, and telemetering a wide range of physiological data in
flight, would contribute substantially to medical planning for space travel.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>

<H3>Zero G</H3>At peak speed and altitude an X-15 flight was supposed to afford
about five minutes of "weightlessness" or "zero g." This is the effect created
when a vehicle is balanced between centrifugal and centripetal forces - when the
gravitational pull of Earth and other heavenly bodies is exactly balanced by the
inertial character of the vehicle's motion. Weightlessness is undoubtedly the
most fascinating medical characteristic of space flight, and it aroused the most
speculation among aviation physicians in the late forties and early fifties. To
be sure, approximations of zero g were not totally new human experiences; a
common illustration of the sensation is the sudden partial lightening of the
body in a rapidly descending elevator. But the necessity to function at zero g -
to eat and drink, to eliminate body wastes, to operate the spacecraft controls -
was a new requirement and presented new problems for the aeromedical teams.
<P>Flight physicians were almost unanimous in expressing forebodings about the
effect of weightlessness on man's physical and mental performance. Some feared
that the body organs depended on sustained gravity and would not function if
deprived of the customary gravitational force. Others worried over the combined
effects of acceleration, weightlessness, and the heavy deceleration during
atmospheric entry. Still other experts were concerned especially about
perception and equilibrium. For example, Heinz Haber and Otto Gauer, another
&eacute;migr&eacute; German physician who joined the Air Force aeromedical program, noted that
the brain receives signals on the position, direction, and support of the body
from four mechanisms - pressure on the nerves and organs, muscle tone, posture,
and the labyrinth of the inner ear. They theorized that these four mechanisms
might give conflicting signals in the weightless state and that such
disturbances "may deeply affect the autonomic nervous functions and ultimately
produce a very severe sensation of succumbence associated with an absolute
incapacity to act."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
<P>The basic difficulty retarding the study of weightlessness was the
impossibility of duplicating the exact condition on Earth. The X-15, considered
by many in the mid-fifties to be the penultimate step to manned orbital flight,
progressed slowly and would fly too late to shed much light on the problem of
zero g for Project Mercury. By the fall of 1958, however, when the newly formed
National [37] Aeronautics and Space Administration undertook to orbit a manned
satellite, American aeromedical researchers had been studying the gravity-free
condition intensively for some eight years.
<P>The best but most expensive device for zero-g experimentation was the
sounding rocket. For several years, beginning with the V-2 firings from White
Sands, parachutes for nose cones containing rocket-launched animals invariably
failed to open and the subjects were killed on impact. The first successful
recovery came in September 1951, when an instrumented monkey and 11 mice
survived an Aerobee launch to 236,000 feet from Holloman Air Force Base, New
Mexico. The last of three Aerobee shots at Holloman, in May 1952, like the
previous experiments, carried a camera on board to photograph two mice and two
monkeys under acceleration, weightlessness, and deceleration. An Air Force
aeromedical team, headed by James P. Henry, a physician who later would direct
the Mercury animal program, and young Captain David G. Simons, found no adverse
effects on the animals.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>For the next six years the priority military ballistic missile program almost
monopolized rocket development in the United States. Medical experimentation
employing live test subjects launched to high altitudes by rockets came to a
virtual standstill. By contrast, during the same period from 1952 to 1957,
researchers in the Soviet Union carried out numerous animal rocket flights, with
dogs of the Pavlovian sort being their favorite passengers. By late 1957, when
the Soviets sent the dog Laika into orbit aboard <I>Sputnik II</I>, the peak
altitude of their vertical launches of animals was nearly 300 miles, and the
Russian scientists had perfected a technique for catapulting animals from nose
cones and recovering them with parachutes. Apparently the Russians also were
able to measure a wider range of physiological reactions than their American
counterparts.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>During the six-year hiatus in animal rocket experimentation in this country,
investigators had to resort to the aircraft, "the oldest aeromedical
laboratory," for studying the weightless phenomenon.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
In 1950, Fritz and Heinz Haber, of the Air Force School of Aviation Medicine,
had considered various ways of simulating zero g for medical experiments.
Discarding the free fall and the elevator ride, the Habers concluded that the
best technique involved an airplane flight along a vertical parabola, or
"Keplerian trajectory." If properly executed, such a maneuver could provide as
much as 35 seconds of zero g and a somewhat longer period of subgravity, a
condition wherein the body is under only partial gravitational stress.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
During the summer and fall of 1951 test pilots A. Scott Crossfield of NACA and
Charles E. Yeager of the Air Force tried out the technique, flying a number of
Keplerian trajectories in jet interceptors. Up to 20 seconds of weightlessness
resulted from some of these flights. Crossfield reported initial "befuddlement"
during zero g but no serious loss of muscle coordination, while Yeager described
a sensation of falling and in one instance of spinning and feeling "lost in
space." The latter sensation the physicians and psychologists called
"disorientation."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>[38] The Habers' technique and these early experiments with it represented a
promising beginning, but as one Air Force aeromedical specialist pointed out,
"The results of these flights were inconclusive in many respects."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
An enormous amount of work remained before students of weightlessness could do
much generalizing about this greatest anomaly of space flight.
<P>In 1953 a small group comprising the Space Biology Branch of the Aeromedical
Field Laboratory at Holloman Air Force Base inaugurated an ambitious program of
parabolic flights to continue the investigations of weightless flight that had
halted with the termination of the Aerobee animal launches in the spring of
1952. Supervised by Major David G. Simons, a physician who acted as test subject
on many occasions, the Holloman studies for two years utilized T-33 and F-89 jet
aircraft. Late in 1955, after Captain Grover J. D. Schock came to the field
laboratory as task scientist, the standard tool for zero g research became the
F-94C, which offered a longer parabola than other aircraft and thus a longer
period of weightlessness. In the summer of 1958 the Air Force canceled all
zero-g research at Holloman, and the coterie of scientists broke up. Colonel
John P. Stapp, head of the field laboratory, and Simons went elsewhere, while
Schock turned his attention to other research projects.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>For three years before the termination of the Holloman flight program,
students of zero g at the School of Aviation Medicine had duplicated and even
surpassed the investigations being carried out in New Mexico. Although sponsored
by the Department of Space Medicine, the program carried out at Randolph Air
Force Base was actually directed by Siegfried Gerathewohl, who was not a member
of the department. Gerathewohl and his colleagues began their studies with the
T-33 jet trainer, but like their counterparts in New Mexico, they soon turned to
the superior F-94C. Major Herbert D. Stallings, a Randolph physician, estimated
that by April 1958 he had flown more than 4000 zero-g trajectories and compiled
about 37 hours of weightless flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>Gerathewohl, Simons, Schock, and the other scientists at Randolph and
Holloman tried to get as great a variety of information as possible during the
30 to 40 seconds of weightlessness and subgravity produced by the F-94C flights.
They carried out numerous eye-hand coordination tests, for example, wherein a
subject tried to make crosses in a pattern or hit a target with a metal stylus.
Subjects usually missed their mark in the first moments of zero g or subgravity,
but most of them improved their performance with their cumulative experience.
The Air Force scientists also studied eating and drinking, bladder function, and
disorientation after awakening during weightlessness; the functions at zero g of
various animals, especially cats, whose vestibular organs had been removed; and
the phenomenon called the "oculo-agravic illusion," wherein luminous objects
seen in the dark appear to move upward during weightlessness.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>At the Wright Air Development Center, in Ohio, a team of researchers headed
by Major Edward L. Brown picked up the experimental program discontinued at
Holloman in mid-1958, except that they used the relatively slow,
propeller-driven [39] C-131 transport in their studies. A parabola in a C-131
gave only 10 to 15 seconds of weightlessness, but the spacious interior of the
cargo carrier made it possible to observe the reactions of several subjects
simultaneously, including their coordination and locomotion and even their
ability to walk along the ceiling while wearing shoes with magnetic soles.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>In general the aeromedical specialists at Randolph, Holloman, and
Wright-Patterson - as well as those in more modest programs at the Navy School
of Aviation Medicine, Pensacola, Florida, and at the NACA Lewis Flight
Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland - found that the principal problems of
weightless flight seemed solvable. Eating and drinking at zero g were not
troublesome when squeeze bottles and tubes were used, and urination presented no
real difficulty. Some subjects suffered nausea, disorientation, loss of
coordination, and other disturbances, but the majority reported that after they
adjusted to the condition they found it "pleasant" and had a feeling of
"well-being."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
As early as 1955, Simons concluded that weightlessness produced no abnormalities
with regard to heart rate and arterial and venous blood pressure, while Henry,
Simons' colleague in the Aerobee animal experiments, prophesied, "In the skilled
pilot weightlessness will probably have very little significance."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
And in 1959, about a year after Project Mercury got underway, Gerathewohl
remarked that "the majority of flying personnel enjoy the exposure to the
subgravity state in our controlled experiments. We have reason to believe that
even longer periods of absolute weightlessness can be tolerated if the crew is
properly conditioned and equipped."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>

<H3>Multiple G</H3>Another problem perplexing aeromedical experts as the era of
space flight neared was the effect on the human body of the heavy acceleration
and deceleration forces, called "g loads," building up during rocket-propelled
flights into space at speeds far greater than those yet experienced by man. Many
fighter pilots in the Second World War had suffered momentary pain and blurred
vision during "redout," when blood pooled in the head and eyes during an outside
loop, or "blackout," when the heart suddenly could not pump enough blood to the
head region as an airplane pulled out of a steep dive. Acceleration of a vehicle
into space and the deceleration accompanying its return to the atmosphere would
subject a man to g loads several times the normal accelerative force of gravity.
In other words, for parts of a space mission a man would come to "weigh" several
times what he normally did on Earth; a severe strain would be imposed on his
body organs.
<P>At the Aeromedical Field Laboratory in New Mexico, Harald J. von Beckh, a
physician who had immigrated from Germany by way of the Instituto Nacional de
Medicina Aeron&aacute;utica in Buenos Aires, was especially concerned about the ability
of a space traveler to tolerate the high deceleration forces of atmospheric
entry after several hours of weightlessness. In the last few months before such
[40] research ended at Holloman, von Beckh inquired into the relationship
between zero g and the multiplication of g. He added a steep downward spiral to
the level, weightless portion of the Keplerian trajectory in order to impose
heavy g loads on a test subject immediately after a half minute or so of
weightlessness. After a number of these parabolic-spiral flights, he reported
pessimistically, "Alternation of weightlessness and acceleration results in a
decrease of acceleration tolerance and of the efficiency of physiologic recovery
mechanisms . . . Because there is a decreased acceleration tolerance," he
warned, "every effort must be made to reduce G loads to a minimum."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
<P>Throughout the 1950s a substantial number of aeromedical experts concerned
themselves with acceleration-deceleration loads per se, not necessarily in
connection with the gravity-free state. Research on g forces reached back for
decades, to the primitive period of aviation medicine. The state of knowledge
with regard to the physiology of acceleration-deceleration was still hazy and
fluid in the early fifties, although for at least 25 years aviation physicians
in Europe and the United States had been studying blackout, redout, impact
forces, and other effects of high g in aircraft.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
The V-2 and Aerobee animal rocket shots also had added to research data on the
problem. But until the X-15 was ready, researchers had about exhausted the
airplane as a tool for studying g loads, and from 1952 to 1958 experimentation
with animal-carrying rockets was suspended in the United States. Consequently
American scientists had to turn to two devices on the ground - the
rocket-powered impact sled, used for studying the immediate onset of g loads,
and the centrifuge, where the slower buildup of g could be simulated - to
enlarge what they knew about the limits of human endurance of heavy acceleration
and deceleration.
<P>On December 10, 1954, Lieutenant Colonel John P. Stapp of the Aeromedical
Field Laboratory gave an amazing demonstration of a man's ability to withstand
immediate impact forces. Stapp rode a rocket-driven impact sled on the
3550-foot Holloman research track to a velocity of 937 feet per second and
received an impact force of 35 to 40 g for a fraction of a second as the sled
slammed to a halt in a water trough.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
In February 1957 a chimpanzee rocketed down the track, now 5000 feet long,
braked to a stop, and survived a load of some 247 g for a millisecond, with a
rate of onset of 16,000 g per second. And 15 months later, on the 120-foot
"daisy track" at Holloman, Captain Eli L. Beeding, seated upright and facing
backward, experienced the highest deceleration peak yet recorded on a human
being - 83 g for .04 of a second, with 3826 g per second as the calculated rate
of onset. Afterward Beeding, recovering from shock and various minor injuries,
judged that 83 g represented about the limit of human tolerance for
deceleration.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
<P>Such studies of deceleration were not directed primarily toward space
missions but rather toward the problem of survival after ejection from or
crashes in high-performance aircraft. The Holloman sled runs of the fifties,
however, did broaden considerably the available data on the absolute limits of
man's ability [41] to endure multiples of g. And, perhaps more important, the
New Mexico experiments in biodynamics were directly applicable to the problem of
high g forces resulting from the uncushioned impact of a spacecraft on water or
land. Stapp reasoned that a properly restrained, aft-facing human being could
withstand a land impact of some 80 knots (135 feet per second) in a spacecraft
if the g forces were applied transversely, or through the body, and if the
spacecraft did not collapse on him.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>The centrifuge, the other laboratory tool used by students of
acceleration-deceleration patterns, became increasingly useful in the fifties.
The basic feature of the centrifuge was a large mechanical arm with a
man-carrying gondola or platform mounted on the end, within which a test subject
would be rotated at high angular velocities. Centrifuge experiments had more
immediate pertinence to space medicine than impact sled tests, because on the
"wheel" investigators could duplicate the relatively gradual buildup of g forces
encountered during the launch and reentry portions of ballistic, orbital, or
interplanetary flight. In the fifties, centrifuges existed at several places in
the United States. The best-known and most used were at the Navy's Aviation
Medical Acceleration Laboratory, Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and at the
Aeromedical Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. During the decade,
researchers at Johnsville, Wright-Patterson, and elsewhere simulated a wide
variety of acceleration and deceleration profiles, using an almost equally wide
variety of body positions and support systems, to compile an impressive quantity
of data on the reactions of potential space pilots to heavy g forces.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<P>Just after the Second World War, Otto Gauer and Heinz Haber, who had
conducted centrifuge experiments for the German Air Force, proposed a series of
acceleration patterns, ranging from 3 g for 9&frac12; minutes to 10 g for 2 minutes,
all of which would be tolerable for a space pilot.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
Then, in 1952, E. R. Ballinger, leader of the research program at
Wright-Patterson, conducted one of the earliest series of centrifuge tests
directed expressly toward the problem of g forces in space flight. Ballinger
found that 3 g applied transversely would be the ideal takeoff pattern from the
physiological standpoint, but he realized that the rocket burning time and
velocity for such a pattern would be insufficient to propel a spacecraft out of
the atmosphere. Consequently he and his associates subjected men to gradually
increasing g loads, building to peaks of 10 g for something over two minutes.
Chest pain, shortness of breath, and occasional loss of consciousness were the
symptoms of those subjected to the higher g loads. The tests led Ballinger to
the conclusion that 8 g represented the acceleration safety limit for a space
passenger.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>Data gained from the first Soviet and American instrumented satellites of
late 1957 and early 1958 showed that the atmosphere reached considerably farther
out than scientists previously had realized. Until these disclosures aeromedical
experts had assumed that the deceleration, or backward acceleration, forces of
reentry, producing what was graphically described as an "eyeballs out"
sensation, [42] would be much greater than the acceleration during the ascent,
or "eyeballs in," phase of the mission. Proceeding on this assumption, a team of
physiologists from the Army, Navy, and Air Force had used the 50-foot centrifuge
at the Navy's Johnsville installation to study the anticipated high reentry g
buildup, exposing five chimpanzees to a peak of 40 g for one minute. Post-run
examinations of the primates showed internal injuries, including heart
malfunctions. It appeared that prolonged subjection to high g might be severely
injurious or perhaps even fatal to a man.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
<P>The tests conducted by Ballinger at Wright-Patterson and the interservice
experiments with the chimpanzees on the Navy centrifuge featured frontward
(eyeballs-in) application of g loads during the launch profile, backward
application (eyeballs-out) during the reentry simulation, and the use of rather
elaborate restraint straps and basic aircraft bucket seats as a support system.
The problem of determining optimum body position and support was vigorously
attacked by biodynamicists during 1957 and 1958. A series of especially careful
studies on the Wright Air Development Center centrifuge indicated that when the
subject was positioned so that the g forces were applied transversely and
backward to the center of rotation, breathing became easier.
Acceleration-deceleration patterns of 12 g for 4 seconds, 8 g for 41 seconds,
and 5 g for 2 minutes were endured without great difficulty by practically all
the volunteer subjects, some having even higher tolerance limits. Results of
runs on the Johnsville centrifuge with the subjects in an aft-facing position
for both acceleration and deceleration patterns also appeared favorable.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
<P>The students of g forces tried various support devices in the late fifties in
their search for ways to increase human tolerance to acceleration and
deceleration loads. One specialist in the Wright-Patterson centrifuge group came
up with a suit of interwoven nylon and cotton material, reinforced by nylon
belting, and attached to the pilot seat at six places to absorb the g loads and
distribute them more evenly over the entire body. Later, Wright-Patterson
scientists using a nylon netting arrangement in conjunction with a contour couch
were able to expose several men to a peak of 16.5 g for several seconds without
any discoverable adverse effects. Other Air Force specialists experimented with
subjects partially enclosed in a "rigid envelope," actually a plaster cast, as
protection against both g-load buildup and impact forces. And von Beckh, whose
concern with the weightlessness-deceleration puzzle led him to experiment with
anti-g techniques, developed a device called "multi-directional g protection," a
compartment that turned automatically to ensure that the g forces were always
applied transversely on its occupant. Von Beckh's invention was used to protect
a rat that went along on Beeding's record sled run in 1958, and a modified
compartment carried three mice on a Thor-Able rocket launch the same year.
Results in both experiments were encouraging.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>Navy scientists were especially interested in water immersion as a means of
minimizing g loads. Researchers in Germany, Canada, and the United States [43]
had experimented with water-lined flying suits and submersion in water tanks,
beginning in the 1930s. Specialists had carried out sporadic biodynamic tests
with immersed rabbits and mice in the late forties at the Navy School of
Aviation Medicine and, after the giant centrifuge began operation in 1952, in
Johnsville.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>In 1956, R. Flanagan Gray, a physician at the Johnsville laboratory, designed
an aluminum centrifuge capsule that could be filled with water and was large
enough to hold a man. After some initial troubles installing the contraption on
the centrifuge and perfecting an emergency automatic flushing mechanism, the
"Iron Maiden," as it was rather inaccurately nicknamed, went into use. In March
1958, Gray, immersed to his ribs in a bathtub-like device developed at the Mayo
Clinic during the Second World War, had endured 16 g of headward (head to feet)
acceleration. Then, the next year, Gray enclosed himself in the Iron Maiden and,
positioned backward to the center of rotation and immersed in water above the
top of his head, held his breath during the 25-second pattern to withstand a
peak of 31 g transverse acceleration for five seconds. This performance with the
water-filled aluminum capsule established a new record for tolerance of
centrifuge g loads.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>Nylon netting, multidirectional positioning, and water immersion were all
promising methods for combating g forces and expanding human endurance limits.
But netting had a troublesome tendency to bounce the subject forward as the g
forces diminished, while directional positioning and water-immersion apparatus
required more space and weight than would be available in a small, relatively
light spacecraft.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
And considering the thrust limitations of the Thor, the Atlas, or the somewhat
larger Titan ICBM, a small spacecraft was the only feasible design for an
American manned satellite in 1958.
<P>At the inception of the NASA manned satellite project, in the fall of 1958,
the apparent solution to the problem of body support was an anti-g contrivance
developed not by biodynamicists but by a group of practicing aerodynamicists in
NACA's Pilotless Aircraft Research Division, part of the Langley Aeronautical
Laboratory in Virginia. Maxime A. Faget, William M. Bland, Jr., Jack C.
Heberlig, and a few other NACA engineers had designed an extremely strong and
lightweight couch, made of fiber glass, which could be contoured to fit the body
dimensions of a particular man. In the spring of 1958, technicians and shopmen
at Langley molded the first of a series of test-model contour couches. The
following July a group from Langley went to the Aviation Medical Acceleration
Laboratory at Johnsville to try out their couch on the Navy's big centrifuge.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>The Navy biodynamicists and the NACA engineers experimented with the couch
and various body positions in an effort to amplify a g-load tolerance. The couch
made at Langley had been molded to fit the physical dimensions of Robert A.
Champine, one of the foremost NACA test pilots. Champine rode the Johnsville
centrifuge to a peak of 12 g on July 29, then departed for a conference on the
Pacific Coast. The next day Navy Lieutenant Carter C. Collins volunteered to
test the couch. Since his frame was smaller than Champine's, the Johnsville [46]
experts had to pack foam-rubber padding into the recesses of the fiber-glass
bed. Collins then climbed into the centrifuge gondola and seated himself in the
couch, the back angle of which was set forward 10 degrees. The 4000-horsepower
centrifuge motor whirled the gondola progressively faster. On the first run the
loads reached a peak of 12 g. Five more runs pushed the peak to 18 g. Then, on
the sixth try, using a grunting technique to avoid blackout and chest pains,
Collins withstood a peak of 20.7 g, applied transversely for a duration of six
seconds. Later that day, Gray, inventor of the Iron Maiden, rode the centrifuge
with the contour couch and also endured a 20-g peak. The acceleration patterns
to which Collins and Gray were exposed corresponded to a reentry angle of 7.5
degrees. At that time the optimum reentry angle being considered for a manned
satellite, 1.5 degrees, theoretically would expose the spacecraft passenger to
only 9 g.<A

<P class="title">Mercury Couch</P>
<IMG src="t044a.jpg">
<P class="caption">One of the most critical design and feasibility problems
in the early days of Mercury was whether the astronaut could be safely
restrained and supported through the succession of vibration levels, g forces,
weightlessness, and more g forces that would occur in space flight. Langley
laboratory engineers conceived the contour couch (above) in 1958, and refined it
enough to try a model (below) in 1959.</P>

<DIV class="figure">
<IMG src="t045a.jpg">
<P class="caption">After the couch concept had been devised, there was the
problem of a system to provide the contradictory combination of restraint,
cushioning, and support. An early couch of nylon netting (above) was ruled out
because it bounced the occupant forward as g forces diminished. The final choice
was fiber glass cast to the contour of each astronaut (below) and equipped with
restraining straps.</P>
<IMG src="t045b.jpg">
</DIV>

<P>The NACA engineers, already working overtime on designs for a manned orbital
capsule, were elated. It seemed that they finally had an effective anti-g device
that was small enough and light enough to fit into a one-ton ballistic capsule
they had in mind for the initial manned space venture.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
They had, in fact, made a major contribution to the protection of a space rider
from sustained high g forces, although they did not fully realize as yet that
body angles were more significant features of the couch than its contoured
support.
<P>The procedure ultimately used for protecting the Mercury astronauts from the
g loads of acceleration to orbital velocity and deceleration during reentry
represented a combination of the advantages gained from many experiments by
military and other specialists in flight physiology, as well as from the
ingenuity of the aeronautical engineers in NACA and NASA. Although the idea of
using a hammock either for the basic support or in combination with the contour
couch was perennially attractive to the human-factors experts in Project
Mercury, all Mercury astronauts sat in essentially the same couch designed by
Faget and his coworkers in the spring of 1958. But added to this basic technique
were restraining straps, a semi-supine posture, frontward application of
acceleration loads, and the reversal of the spacecraft attitude during orbit to
permit frontward imposition of reentry loads as well. The final elements in the
NACA-NASA campaign to minimize the effects of insertion-reentry g buildups was
the use as astronauts of experienced test pilots provided by the military
services. During the centrifuge experiments of the fifties such men had
consistently proved capable of withstanding higher g forces than nonpilots.

<H3>Environmental Control</H3>High-altitude atmospheric flight had necessitated
much work related to two serious physiological problems of space flight - air
supply and the pressure required for breathing in space. Research on these
problems in the United States stretched back to 1918, when the Army began
operation of a decompression chamber at Hazelhurst Field, Long Island. In the
early 1930s the civilian aviator [47] Wiley Post wore a pressure suit, looking
like a deep-sea diver's outfit, for high-altitude flying. By the early fifties
the typical jet pilot breathed pure oxygen for hours in an artificially
pressurized cabin while wearing a pressurized flying suit as an extra protection
in case of cabin decompression.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
<P>Air compression, however, is not practicable above 80,000 feet. Travel
outside the breathable atmosphere, whether into space or to the bottom of the
sea, necessitates living inside a hermetically sealed compartment, a completely
airtight ecological system in which carbon dioxide exhaled by the traveler is
constantly replaced by an onboard supply of pure oxygen or some combination
approximating the nitrogen-oxygen composition at sea level. In this area of
space flight research - space cabin environment - the Air Force achieved
preeminence in the early fifties with the development of the first sealed space
cabin.
<P>The sealed space cabin had two essential precursors. One was the sealed
gondola for stratospheric ballooning, used by the Swiss twins Auguste and Jean
Piccard in several flights to altitudes of around 10 miles in the 1930s and in
the <I>Explorer II</I> ascent of 1935, which carried Army experimenters Orvil A.
Anderson and A. W. Stevens to 72,335 feet and set a record that stood for 20
years.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
The other was the closed underwater environment of the bathysphere, used for
many years in deep-sea exploration, and of the submarine. In the fifties, Air
Force research on the sealed space cabin paralleled similar work by Navy
scientists on an environmental control system for the new atomic-powered
submarines, which were being designed to remain totally submerged for months.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>In 1952, Fritz Haber, of the Air Force School of Aviation Medicine, drew
blueprints for a sealed chamber to be used for space medicine research; at the
urging of Hubertus Strughold the Air Force let a contract for its construction.
The Guardite Company of Chicago delivered a completed cabin in the summer of
1954.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
"Nobody took notice of a 'sealed cabin,'" recalled Strughold. "We had to have a
name that would attract attention to our work. So I named it the 'Space Cabin
Simulator.'"<A
href="notes.htm#n2.45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
<P>The cabin provided about 100 cubic feet of living space, room enough for an
ordinary aircraft seat and a panel of lights, switches, and displays to test the
psychological reactions of the subject. It had systems for air conditioning,
oxygen supply and carbon dioxide absorption, urine distillation, and the
recycling of the distilled urine together with air moisture to provide water
pure enough to drink. Cabin pressure was maintained constantly at a level
equivalent to an altitude of 18,000 to 25,000 feet.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>The space cabin simulator received its first national publicity in March
1956, when Airman D. F. Smith spent 24 hours in the chamber at San Antonio,
performing a number of tasks for psychological monitoring and wearing
instrumentation to record his heart action, temperature, and respiration rate.
During the next two years, Lieutenant Colonel George R. Steinkamp, Captain
Julian Ward, and George T. Hauty, who had charge of the simulations, gradually
increased the duration of the tests. On February 16, 1958, four and a half
months after [48] <I>Sputnik I</I> and after seven days in the sealed chamber,
Airman Donald F. Farrell stepped out to be greeted by a crowd of newsmen and by
Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. In this, the most famous experiment ever run in the
original space cabin simulator, Farrell had spent his week completely isolated
in an environment that duplicated life inside a spacecraft in every respect
except the weightless condition.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>The Farrell experiment provided no unexpected physiological data. But Hauty,
chiefly interested in the psychological portion of the simulation, reported that
the daily log kept by Farrell showed a deterioration from good spirits to "the
seemingly abrupt onset of frank hostility." Farrell's mental condition "reached
the point of becoming the single conceivable reason for a premature termination
of the flight." Hauty noted that Farrell's proficiency at tasks assigned to him
also deteriorated severely as the experiment progressed.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>The psychological data from the early space cabin simulator tests, as well as
observation of subjects in the isolation chamber at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base, were not encouraging. Major Charles A. Berry, an Air Force physician who
later would work closely with the astronauts in Project Mercury, perhaps
expressed the consensus among space medicine investigators by 1958: "The
psychological problems presented by the exposure of man to an isolated,
uncomfortable void seem to be more formidable than the physiological
problems."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>

<H3>Matter From Space</H3>Even after enclosing himself in a sealed cabin and
adjusting to prolonged isolation, the first man in space ran the danger of being
killed by decompression if his cabin were punctured by one of the myriad
meteoroids, ranging in size from less than a millimeter up to several meters,
that constantly bombard Earth's atmosphere.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
Impact with a meteoroid, even one the size of a BB shot, conceivably could put a
hole in the structure of a spacecraft and cause death to its occupant through
either gradual or explosive cabin decompression.
<P>In the forties and early fifties scientists varied widely in their guesses as
to the probability of meteoroid impact. Fletcher G. Watson, a Harvard University
astronomer, predicted in 1946 that at least one of every 25 space ships going to
the Moon would be destroyed by collision with a meteoroid. Two years later
George Grimminger, a mathematician with the Rand Corporation, estimated that a
spacecraft with an exposed area of 1000 square feet would be hit by a particle
with a diameter of &frac12; millimeter only about once every 15 years. As late as 1951,
however, Fred L. Whipple of Harvard, one of the principal American authorities
on meteoroids, was rather pessimistic about the chances of avoiding meteoroid
penetration and suggested thick shielding on the spacecraft to guard against
structural damage.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>The early instrumented satellites sent up by the Soviet Union and the United
States did much to dispel the fears of the space flight enthusiasts about
meteoroids. [49] The American satellite <I>Explorer I</I>, launched in January
1958, recorded only seven hits by micrometeoroids - particles considerably less
than a millimeter in diameter - during the first month of its orbital life.
Apparently none of these pieces of matter penetrated the satellite's outer skin.
Data from the much larger Russian <I>Sputnik III</I>, sent into orbit in May
1958, indicated that an orbiting spacecraft with a surface of 1000 square
meters (10,760 square feet) would be hit by a meteoroid weighing at least one
gram only once every 14,000 hours. And <I>Explorer VI</I>, orbited by the United States
in the late summer of 1959, encountered meteoroid dust particles only 28 times
during the first two days it was in orbit.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
These data prompted a human-factors specialist for one of the major aerospace
firms to conclude that for low orbital missions in a manned spacecraft "the
danger from meteorite [sic] penetration is minor to negligible in comparison to
the other hazards of such flights."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
Nevertheless, Project Mercury astronauts would wear a full-pressure suit, a
closed ecological system in itself, so that if cabin decompression occurred each
astronaut could live until his space capsule could be brought back to Earth.

<H3>Space Radiation</H3>In addition to weightlessness, g loads, air, water, and
food supply, isolation, and meteoroids, the problems of space flight included
protecting the passenger from different kinds of electromagnetic radiation found
above the atmosphere. Of the varieties of radiations in space the most
mysterious is cosmic radiation, the source of which presents one of the grandest
puzzles in nuclear astrophysics. Some of this radiation possibly comes from the
Sun, but the preponderance of the cosmic rays bombarding Earth's atmosphere
evidently originates outside the solar system - thus the term "cosmic"
radiation. High-energy cosmic ray primaries - subatomic particles, of which
about 90 percent are protons of hydrogen and helium - slam into the atmosphere
at velocities approaching the speed of light. Fifteen to 25 miles above Earth,
the cosmic ray primaries collide with atoms and molecules in the thickening
atmosphere, are broken up, and are converted into lower-energy rays called
secondaries. Above 25 miles the atmosphere becomes too thin to absorb the cosmic
ray primaries; since they are capable of penetrating a thick lead wall, it was
futile to try to shield a spacecraft pilot completely. So in the early 1950s
medical researchers, assuming that a space pilot would be exposed to some cosmic
radiation, approached the problem primarily from the angle of establishing how
large a dose a human being could tolerate.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
<P>As with weightlessness and g-load research, the best postwar device for
studying cosmic radiation was the instrumented sounding rocket. But the last of
the rocket experiments with primates occurred in May 1952. From that time until
animal rocket shots resumed in 1958, the only upper-atmospheric research rockets
fired in the country were occasional Aerobees, launched by the Air Force to
altitudes of about 150 miles.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
These shots, carrying only instruments, brought back a modicum of data on cosmic
rays. The prime instrument for cosmic ray [50] research from 1952 to 1958 was
the oldest vehicle for human flight, the balloon. The postwar development of
sturdier, larger, polyethylene balloons to replace rubber aerostats made
possible higher and higher ascents with increasingly heavier loads. At the same
time the expansion of balloon technology, leading to an increasing number of
giant, shiny spheres floating over the United States, multiplied reports of and
popular interest in "Unidentified Flying Objects."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
<P>In the balloon-borne space radiation experiments of the fifties, the Navy
carried out some notable manned ascents into the stratosphere. On November 8,
1956, for example, Lieutenant Commanders Malcolm D. Ross and M. L. Lewis, as
part of the Navy's Strato-Lab program of manned ascents from northern latitudes,
reached 76,000 feet, then an altitude record. Less than a year later Ross and
Lewis sat in their cramped sealed gondola as their huge polyethylene balloon
ascended to nearly 86,000 feet. And in late June 1958 the same two Navy
aerostation veterans remained in the 70,000&ndash;80,000-foot region for almost 35
hours.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
<P>The Navy also pioneered in the use of balloon-launched rockets (rockoons).
The first successful rockoon launch occurred in August 1952 when, from a ship
off the coast of Greenland, a University of Iowa team headed by physicist James
A. Van Allen sent up a balloon from which a rocket ignited at 70,000 feet and
climbed to an altitude of nearly 40 miles. The Navy did most of its
upper-atmospheric research, however, with instrumented balloon flights carrying
small organisms and insects. In May 1954, for example, General Mills,
Incorporated, under contract to the Office of Naval Research, launched a
polyethylene balloon, with a capacity of 3 million cubic feet, that carried
cosmic ray emulsions - plates designed for recording the tracks of ionizing
particles - to an altitude of 115,000 feet. Five years later, from Sioux Falls,
South Dakota, Raven Industries launched an Office of Naval Research balloon
biological package to a record altitude of 148,000 feet.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
<P>The center of Air Force balloon research in the early 1950s was the
Aeromedical Field Laboratory in New Mexico. From July 21, 1950, when Air Force
personnel launched the first polyethylene balloon at Holloman Air Force Base, to
December 18, 1958, the scientists at the field laboratory sent up 1000 research
balloons, although only a small number of these ascents were designed expressly
for cosmic ray study. In 1953 the Holloman researchers moved most of their
balloon experiments to the northern United States, in the higher geomagnetic
latitudes, where they could obtain increased exposure to cosmic ray primaries.
During the next year they sent aloft a collection of radish seeds on a series of
flights, compiling some 251 hours of exposure of the seeds above 80,000 feet.
Monkeys, mice, rats, hamsters, and rabbits also drifted upward in balloons
launched by Winzen Research, Incorporated, as a Holloman contractor, from Sault
Ste. Marie, Michigan. The most interesting effect observed among the various
test subjects was a striking increase in the number of gray hairs on black mice
exposed to the high altitudes.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
<P>The first solo manned ascent into the stratosphere was also principally an
undertaking [51] of the field laboratory at Holloman. In 1956 field laboratory
experimenters inaugurated Project Manhigh, a series of flights from northern
sites using Winzen balloons, to test man's ability to live for prolonged periods
in a sealed-cabin environment like that inside a spacecraft and to gather new
data on cosmic radiation. David Simons, head of the Space Biology Branch at
Holloman, was project officer for the Manhigh ascents. The initial flight, from
Fleming Field, Minnesota, took place on June 2, 1957. Captain Joseph W.
Kittinger stayed aloft inside his sealed gondola for nearly seven hours,
breathing pure oxygen, making visual observations, and talking frequently with
John P. Stapp, the flight surgeon, and other physicians on the ground. Kittinger
spent two hours above 92,000 feet; his maximum altitude during the flight was
96,000 feet.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
<P>About nine weeks later Simons himself entered the space equivalent region,
suspended in a sealed capsule below a 3-million-cubic-foot polyethylene balloon
launched from an open-face mine near Crosby, Minnesota. Simons exceeded
Kittinger's mark for both duration and altitude, staying aloft 32 hours and
remaining at 101,000 feet for about 5 hours. Simons was the first man in history
to see the Sun set and then rise again from the edge of space. In the <I>Manhigh
II</I> gondola he spent more time than anyone before him looking upward at the
blackness of space and outward at the white and blue layers of the atmosphere.
"The capsule seemed like a welcome window permitting a fabulous view and
precious opportunities, not a prison or an enclosure," he related after the
flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
<P>In October 1958 an excessive temperature rise in the capsule forced a
premature termination of the third Manhigh flight, carrying Lieutenant Clifton
M. McClure.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
Yet McClure's ascent, together with those of Kittinger and Simons, proved the
workability of the sealed cabin for sustaining human life where "the environment
is as hostile and very nearly as different in appearance as one would expect to
observe from a satellite."<A
href="notes.htm#n2.63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
The environmental control system of the Manhigh capsule and the instrumentation
for physiological telemetering were strikingly similar to those later used in
the Mercury spacecraft.
<P>With regard to cosmic radiation, however, the Manhigh flights, like numerous
rocket, balloon, and laboratory experiments of previous and succeeding years,
returned data that were either negative or inconclusive. During the <I>Manhigh
II</I> ascent two containers of bread mold were attached to the underside of the
capsule, and Simons wore emulsion plates on his arms and chest to measure cosmic
ray penetration. The plates did show indications of several hits by so-called
"heavy" primaries - cosmic ray particles made up of nuclear particles heavier
than are found in hydrogen or helium - but years later the skin in the area of
the plates revealed no effects of radiation.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>
<P>All these experiments left most scientists as reluctant to speculate about
the hazards from cosmic rays in flight as they had been in the early fifties.
Simons felt that in manned orbital flights following roughly equatorial orbits,
where the spacecraft remained within the protective shielding of Earth's
magnetic fields, the spacecraft pilot would be in no danger from cosmic
radiation. Yet he remained [52] troubled by the possibility that a solar flare,
a sudden burst of energy from the Sun, might precipitate a great increase in
cosmic ray intensity during a space mission. About a twentyfold multiplication
of cosmic radiation accompanied a solar flare of February 1956. Simons' concern
with solar flares led him to the conclusion that continuous voice contact
between ground stations and the space pilot would be essential, as well as
stepped-up efforts to predict the flares.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.65"><SUP>65</SUP></A>
<P>All proponents of manned space flight were alarmed when information
transmitted from the first three Explorer satellites, launched during the first
half of 1958, disclosed the existence of a huge envelope of radiation beyond the
ionosphere. Evidently consisting of protons and electrons trapped in Earth's
magnetic field, the radiation layer begins about 400 miles out in space and
doubles in intensity about every 60 miles before tapering away about 1200 miles
from Earth. This discovery was the first "Van Allen belt," named after James A.
Van Allen, United States director of the International Geophysical Year
radiation experiments. The <I>Pioneer III</I> probe, launched in December 1958,
failed to reach escape velocity, but it did reveal that the radiation zone
consisted not of one belt but of two at least - an inner belt of high-energy
particles and an outer belt of less energetic particles. Two earlier Pioneer
shots, in October and November, had shown that while the radiation zone was
several thousand miles deep, it did not extend into space indefinitely.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.66"><SUP>66</SUP></A>
Quite obviously, the doughnut-shaped Van Allen belts would pose a serious threat
for manned travel in high orbits or interplanetary voyages. In the early manned
ventures into space, however, a spacecraft could be placed in an orbit 100 to
150 miles from Earth, high enough to be free of atmospheric frictional drag, yet
low enough to stay under the Van Allen radiation.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.67"><SUP>67</SUP></A>
<P>The radiation hazards of space flight also include solar radiation. Solar
heat, ultraviolet rays, and x-rays all become much more intense beyond the
diffusive atmosphere of Earth, but they can be adequately counteracted by space
cabin insulation, shielding, refractive paint, and other techniques. Advanced
space missions may subject astronauts to dangers from other kinds of radiation,
such as the radiation belts surrounding other planets or the radioactivity
produced by a spacecraft with a nuclear powerplant.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.68"><SUP>68</SUP></A>

<H3>A Reason for Research</H3>During 1958, scientists and engineers, both
military and civilian, talked more openly than they had in previous years about
radiation dosages, meteoroid penetration, weightlessness, and the other
anomalies of space travel. They received a considerably more respectful hearing.
What made members of the Congress and Americans in general responsive to such
discussions and interested in past research and future plans for space
exploration were the ever-larger scientific satellites launched by the Soviet
Union, beginning October 4, 1957. In the midst of the nationalistic humiliation
following the Sputniks, not only space [53] rocketry but also medical research
with rockets received an invaluable boost. In May 1958, Air Force physicians
sent mice along on three reentry tests of the Able ablation nose cone for the
Thor. Then, the following December and in May 1959, the Navy School of Aviation
Medicine dispatched monkeys, sea-urchin eggs and sperm, molds, tissues, and
seeds on two test firings of the Jupiter intermediate-range missile, carried out
by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency.<A
href="notes.htm#n2.69"><SUP>69</SUP></A>
<P>The new focus on space, the new curiosity about what went on beyond the
atmosphere, the determination to "catch up" in the space race - these sentiments
redounded to the benefit of those Americans who had been trying to solve the
biological and technological puzzles of manned space flight long before there
was a space race. Their principal stimulus was not international prestige or the
drive for technological supremacy; it was a desire to discover the undiscovered,
to probe into the unknown. And they believed that wherever man's instruments
went, man should follow. The proponents of manned space flight in the United
States could be found in several locations - in the military, in some
universities, in the aerospace industry, even in the Congress. But an especially
zealous contingent worked for NACA. Ultimately its members would become the
engineering and managerial nucleus of the American program to rocket a man into
orbit around Earth and bring him back.
