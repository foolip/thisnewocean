<H1><SUP></SUP>Seven Astronauts-In-Training</H1>[235] When the astronauts first 
had reported to the Task Group at the end of April 1959, they had been oriented 
with a series of lectures covering every aspect of STG's progress. After a 
welcoming general briefing by Paul E. Purser, Alan B. Kehlet delivered their 
first lecture on April 29, explaining the configuration and the escape system. 
Following two weeks of such lectures, the group began to visit contractor 
facilities for familiarization with mockups, hardware, and manufacturing 
processes. They went to the launch site at Cape Canaveral. At various military 
and medical centers, each man learned to know himself still better through 
training sessions in the pressure suit, in heat chambers, in heavy 
concentrations of carbon dioxide, and in parabolic flying. By July, Robert Voas, 
the astronauts' training officer, had prepared tentative curricula and 
schedules; during unscheduled times, each man was expected each week to fly for 
three hours, to spend six hours on his specialty area, and to exercise at least 
four hours in athletics. The primitive jury-rigged air-bearing platform trainer 
also was ridden by each astronaut for two hours per week at first.
<P>During August 1959, each man spent approximately two weeks at Johnsville 
riding the centrifuge in "closeloop" (i.e., with man in the control circuit) 
simulation of the exit and reentry profiles. In September each man spent a week 
at McDonnell, another at the Cape for the Big Joe shot, and another at the 
Goodrich plant in Akron being fitted for his pressure suit. And in October 1959, 
the seven pilots, by now reluctant celebrities, traveled to Edwards and 
Vandenberg Air Force Bases, to the AiResearch and Convair factories, and to the 
Naval School of Aviation Medicine at Pensacola for different kinds of centrifuge 
runs and for training in survival, disorientation, and communications.<A

<P>Although everyone who read the news or looked at <I>Life</I> magazine knew 
that the Mercury astronauts had been assigned specialty areas befitting their 
profession as engineering test pilots, few could see the logic of those 
assignments.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> 
M. Scott Carpenter accepted responsibility for communications and navigation 
because as a Navy lieutenant he had had special training in airborne electronics 
and celestial pathfinding. Virgil I. Grissom, who had earned a degree in 
mechanical engineering from Purdue University in 1950, became the expert for the 
group on the complicated electromechanical, automatic, and manual 
attitude-control systems. The senior man in age and date of rank, John H. Glenn, 
Jr., had the most experience in flying varieties of aircraft and could therefore 
make the best contribution to cockpit layout. Walter M. Schirra, Jr., born to a 
flying family and a graduate of the Naval Academy, took a special interest in 
life-support systems and the pressure suits. Alan B. Shepard, Jr., like 
Carpenter and Schirra, had the background training of the naval flier for 
specializing in tracking and recovery operations. L. Gordon Cooper, Jr., and 
Donald K. Slayton, both Air Force captains, accepted the jobs of astronaut 
liaison with the developers of the Redstone and the [237] Atlas boosters, 
respectively. Cooper, the youngest of the group, had been dedicated to flying 
since childhood and had worked with performance engineering similar to what he 
would encounter at Redstone Arsenal. And Slayton, with a degree in aeronautical 
engineering from the University of Minnesota and having worked for two years 
with the Boeing Company in Seattle, was best fitted to report on the progress of 
the Atlas booster at Convair/Astronautics.
<P>The astronauts' specialty assignments had some direct effect on the redesign 
of the Mercury suit, cockpit layout, and capsule hatch and window systems. More 
importantly, the assignments kept the crew informed in depth on the problems and 
progress in major areas of concern to all members. Carpenter and Shepard kept 
tabs on the progress of the Tracking Unit at Langley and of the Goddard Space 
Flight Center in preparing to operate the network. While Carpenter monitored the 
development of onboard navigation equipment, such as the Earth-path indicator 
and starfinder charts, Shepard paid special attention to recovery at sea and to 
problems of egress from the capsule and survival on Earth in inhospitable 
environments. Grissom studied the electromechanical worries of Robert G. 
Chilton, Thomas V. Chambers, and other controls engineers. Schirra worked 
closely with Richard Johnston and John Barton on the environmental system, and 
with Lee McMillion, Gilbert North, and the Goodrich people in preliminary 
fittings of the pressure suit. Cooper and Slayton spent much of their time 
traveling to Huntsville and southern California, respectively, attending 
meetings and offering suggestions from the pilot's viewpoint on how best to mate 
a manned capsule with the Redstone and Atlas missiles. Glenn, meanwhile, paid 
special attention to optimizing the cockpit and improving simulation training.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
<P>Within months after joining the Space Task Group, the more eager than anxious 
astronauts found themselves barraged by questions regarding their emotional 
feelings about being catapulted into orbit. In answer to one such set of 
questions, posed in an author's questionnaire for a high-school textbook, 
Schirra perfunctorily replied that it was only natural for a test pilot to want 
to participate in the most advanced form of manned vehicular travel. Schirra's 
desire to "go higher, farther, and faster" than previously had been possible was 
to him neither mysterious nor worthy of introspection; it was simply the 
professional commitment of them all and of STG to want to expand the test 
pilot's "envelope."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>Partly because of this kind of natural public interest and partly because the 
civilian space agency had a statutory mandate to conduct educational publicity, 
NASA Headquarters, after investigation and decision, encouraged the astronauts 
to stay together and to accept the fringe benefits of a single 
private-enterprise publishing offer arranged in outline even before their 
selection. This precluded eventual competitive bidding for individual story 
rights. On August 5, 1959, the astronauts sold their "personal stories" to the 
highest bidder, Time-Life, Inc., for $500,000, an amount to be equally divided 
regardless of who might be chosen first to fly in space. This money was to be 
paid in installments throughout the program. The astronauts' wives also 
subscribed to the contract. [238] Defense Department policy had been followed by 
the NASA decision because the astronauts were active-duty military officers.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> 
There were similar precedents for test pilots, Presidents, and submarine 
captains. Many Congressmen approved this form of extra life insurance for the 
astronauts' wives.
<P>A public furor, nevertheless, arose in the press over these exclusive rights 
to publish the memoirs of the seven. Few other peripheral policy decisions 
regarding Project Mercury were to become so controversial in the long run. As 
the waiting period before an astronaut flew in space stretched on, public 
interest grew; the competition among newsmen and media increased; the line 
between personal and public domains blurred. NASA and STG were forced to contend 
with no small amount of adverse and even spiteful publicity from indignant 
correspondents who were not of the favored few. Warren North, two days after 
this contract was signed, advised Silverstein about it and warned of other 
impending difficulties, including a loss of privacy to a degree the astronauts 
might not have anticipated.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
<P>The agreement, arranged without fee by C. Leo DeOrsey, a prominent Washington 
lawyer and sportsman, assigned all magazine and book rights to Time-Life, Inc., 
for "non-official" feature stories on the astronauts and their families. Since 
it was cleared by NASA's legal and public relations chiefs, John Johnson and 
Walter T. Bonney, the astronauts and the Task Group had to adapt themselves to 
this policy. John A. "Shorty" Powers, at least, was relieved of one headache and 
was not displeased with the arrangements.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>Although Robert Voas at first had designed an orderly curriculum for the 
astronauts, their activities soon became so diverse and the group separated on 
sorties for their specialties so often that the academic approach became 
impossible. The coordination of astronaut training became his chief duty. Voas 
gathered and trained a team of training specialists. George C. Guthrie had 
responsibility for improving training aids, procedures, and simulation devices; 
Raymond G. Zedekar arranged the lecture series; Stanley Faber conducted the 
four-phase centrifuge training program on the Johnsville "wheel." By the end of 
1959, each of the astronauts had trained for about 10 hours riding the gondola 
at Johnsville. Voas, meanwhile, turned his attention to an extensive astronaut 
task analysis, which paralleled the work of Edward Jones at McDonnell.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> 
Just before Christmas 1959, John Glenn privately described his training 
experiences in a letter to a friend and fellow pilot: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This past 8 or 9 months has really been a hectic program, to say 
  the least, and by far the most interesting thing in which I have ever taken 
  part, outside of combat.
  <P>Following our selection in April, we were assigned to the Space Task Group 
  portion of NASA at Langley Field, and that is where we are based when not 
  traveling. The way it has worked out, we have spent so much time on the road 
  that Langley has amounted to a spot to come back to get clean skivvies and 
  shirts and that's about all. We have had additional sessions at Wright Field 
  in which we did heat chamber, pressure chamber, and centrifuge work and spent 
  a couple of weeks this fall doing additional centrifuge work up at Johnsville. 
  [239] This was some program since we are running it in a laydown position 
  similar to that which we will use in the capsule later on and we got up to as 
  high as 16 g's. That's a batch in any attitude, laydown or not.
  <P>With the angles we were using, we found that even lying down at 16 g's it 
  took just about every bit of strength and technique you could muster to retain 
  consciousness. I found there was quite a bit more technique involved in taking 
  this kind of g than we had thought. Our tolerances from beginning to end of 
  runs during the period we worked up there went up considerably as we each 
  developed our own technique for taking this high g. A few runs a day like that 
  can really get to you. Some other stuff we did up there involved what we call 
  tumble runs or going from a plus g in two seconds to a minus g and the most we 
  did on this was in going from a plus 9 g to a minus 9 g. Obviously a delta of 
  18. . . . When we first talked about doing this, I didn't think it would be 
  possible but in doing a careful buildup we happily discovered that this was 
  not so horrible. At plus 9 g to minus 9 g we were bouncing around a bit but it 
  was quite tolerable.
  <P>
  <CENTER>* * * * * *</CENTER>
  <P>We just finished an interesting activity out at Edwards AFB doing some 
  weightless flying in the F-100. This was in the two-place F-100 so that we 
  could ride in the rear seat and try various things such as eating and drinking 
  and mechanical procedures while going through the approximately 60 second 
  ballistic parabola that you make with a TF-100. That started at about 40,000 
  feet, 30 degrees dive to 25,000, picking up about 1.3 to 1.4 mach number, pull 
  out and get headed up hill again at 25,000 and about a 50 degree or 60 degree 
  climb angle, at which point they get a zero-g parabola over the top to about 
  60 degrees downhill.
  <P>You can accomplish quite a bit in the full minute in those conditions and 
  contrary to this being a problem, I think I have finally found the element in 
  which I belong. We have done a little previous work floating around in the 
  cabin of the C-131 they used at Wright Field. That is even more fun yet, 
  because you are not strapped down and can float around in the cabin doing 
  flips, walk on the ceiling or just come floating the full length of the cabin 
  while going through the approximately 15 seconds of weightlessness that they 
  can maintain on their shorter parabola. That was a real ball and we get some 
  more sessions with this machine sometime after the first of the year.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source36"><SUP>36</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Seasoned 
rocket experts, especially in Wernher von Braun's group, were worried early in 
the program over the human tolerance to noise and vibration at the tip of a 
missile leaving Earth's atmosphere. Biomedical experimentation during the 
fifties had almost, but not quite, confirmed that a man literally can be shaken 
to death by sympathetic vibrations induced through various harmonics upon 
certain organs. No one was yet sure whether the 140-decibel noise limit would be 
attenuated enough by the double-walled capsule and the astronaut's helmet to 
keep him comfortable and able to communicate.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> 
In February 1960, a representative from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency at 
Huntsville proposed a training project in which astronauts would experience 
controlled noise and vibration inside a simulated Mercury capsule mounted above 
a Jupiter engine being static-fired. The astronauts' personal physician, William 
Douglas, objected vehemently and saved the astronauts from this ordeal. [240] 
Internal acoustic measurements in the capsules riding Big Joe and Little Joe 2, 
however, gave concern that aerodynamic noise at max q might blot out 
communications if it approached the 140-decibel limit. The astronauts decided to 
condition themselves to loud noises in other ways by occasionally stationing 
themselves near the blow-down exhausts of the wind tunnels around Langley. 
Carpenter, supported by the environmental control system in capsule No. 3, sat 
through these static noise tests and proved that communications remained 
satisfactory in spite of extremely loud outside noises.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>Other carefully controlled trials by ordeal were arranged to teach the 
astronauts how best to survive for a time anywhere on Earth beneath their 
planned orbital track. During the spring and summer of 1960, capsule egress 
training, and water, desert, and jungle survival courses were instituted for 
their benefit. So exotic and picturesque were these excursions that publicity 
photographs flooded the news media.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
<P>Serious consideration was not given to the use of a personal parachute, with 
which the astronaut might bail out from his explosive side hatch, until May 
1960, when Lee McMillion and Alan Shepard suggested the idea for the 
Mercury-Redstone flights at least. The exploits of the Air Force balloonist, 
Captain Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr., who had been making solo stratospheric ascents 
for the Air Force since 1957, were a significant factor in this reevaluation of 
the personal parachute. In Project Excelsior, Kittinger began a series of 
record-breaking sky dives. On November 16, 1959, he jumped from an open gondola 
at an altitude of 76,400 feet. Three weeks later, from <I>Excelsior II</I>, he 
bailed out at an altitude of 74,700 feet to establish a free-fall record of 
55,000 feet before pulling his ripcord. STG knew of Kittinger's plans for 
<I>Excelsior III</I>, which he fulfilled on August 16, 1960, by diving from his 
balloon at 103,000 feet and falling 17 miles before opening his chute at 17,500 
feet. If Kittinger could do it, so might the Mercury astronaut in case the 
escape tower would not jettison or both main parachutes failed on a 
Mercury-Redstone flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>Although supposedly the first phase of astronaut training through 1959 was to 
concentrate on academic studies in the eclectic new field of "space science," 
the astronauts did not relish book-learning at the expense of field trips, 
specialty assignments, and familiarization with the developing hardware. As soon 
as new training aids and partial simulators became available, they would make 
full use of them. Late in 1959, however, the only operable flight simulator was 
a crude "lash-up" of analog computers driving a cockpit panel display above a 
couch on an air-bearing floating platform at Langley. Gradually STG engineers 
Harold I. Johnson, Rodney F. Higgins, and George Guthrie built more 
sophistication into this special kind of Link trainer. By January 1960 they were 
calling it the Air Bearing Orbital Attitude Simulator. In use and development 
simultaneously through 1960, this machine slowly evolved into a major training 
aid called the ALFA (for "air lubricated free attitude" [or axis] ) trainer. 
McDonnell provided a capsule shell as an egress trainer in mid-February 1960. 
But the most valuable and [241] elaborate training aids were the two 
McDonnell-built simulators called "procedures trainers." One for team training 
at the Cape and another at Langley were installed and in use by April 1960. 
Through long hours of practice in these procedures trainers, the astronauts 
"overlearned" their tasks, as Jones had recommended, so that they would act 
almost reflexively during their mission sequence.
<P>During the first year of the astronaut training program, the seven pilots 
heard approximately 50 hours of space science lectures given primarily by senior 
members of the Langley Research Center. Elementary mechanics and aerodynamics 
made up 10 hours of this time. Formal presentations in space physics took up 12 
hours. Other courses included principles of guidance and control (4 hours), 
navigation in space (6 hours), elements of communications (2 hours), and basic 
physiology (8 hours). Each astronaut spent approximately 8 hours at Morehead 
Planetarium at the University of North Carolina on star recognition and 
practicing celestial navigation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
<P>"Phase Two" of the training program, based on simulation training and 
engineering involvement, was to begin with the new year. But concurrent 
developments, individual study, and personal practice in various areas 
complicated the astronauts' training calendar. At the end of one full year of 
assignment to STG, each of the seven had spent approximately 10 days in St. 
Louis at the McDonnell plant; five days in San Diego at the Convair/Astronautics 
factory; and two days each at the Cape, at Huntsville, at Edwards Air Force 
Base, in El Segundo at Space Technology Laboratories and the Air Force Ballistic 
Missile Division, and at the Goodrich plant in Akron. Each also spent one day at 
the Rocketdyne factory of North American Aviation to see the engines being 
produced for the Atlas, another day at the AiResearch shops to meet the makers 
of their environmental control systems, and yet another at the Los Angeles plant 
of a subcontractor, Protection, Incorporated, where individual headgear was 
being molded.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> 
These visits by the astronauts to the various industrial production lines were 
found to be so valuable in inspiring craftsmen and technicians at all levels to 
higher standards of workmanship that these personal contacts between producers 
and the astronaut-consumers became a regular feature of quality control 
programs. Grissom's simple remark on a visitation to Convair, "Do good work!" 
became a motto of incalculable value to every worker who heard it or shook his 
hand. 
<P>The astronauts also made many field trips to Government installations for 
familiarization with specific conditions of space flight. In addition to the 
training for high accelerations on the centrifuges at Johnsville, Dayton, and 
Pensacola, training for zero acceleration - weightlessness - was distilled from 
the short parabolic hops that were flown in C-131s at Wright-Patterson Air Force 
Base and in F-100 aircraft at the School of Aviation Medicine in San Antonio. 
Closer to their Langley home, the astronauts mastered scuba diving at the Naval 
Amphibious Base near Norfolk; at their home base swimming pool they practiced 
floating fully suited. Also immersions in a Langley test tank gave them the 
sensation of neutral buoyancy. Both at Dayton and Philadelphia the astronauts 
borrowed military [244] facilities to experience reduced ambient pressures in 
decompression chambers. For conditioning to withstand high heating rates, the 
astronauts were toasted in the Air Crew Equipment Laboratory ovens and in a 
"human calorimeter" at the National Institute of Mental Health at Bethesda. Two 
facilities at Pensacola, the "rotating room" and the "human disorientation 
device," provided some experience with induced vertigo. But for complex tumbling 
experiences, each astronaut spent some time at NASA's Lewis Center in Cleveland, 
in the curious test device called the "MASTIF." Finally, each man learned to 
know his own idiosyncrasy to high concentrations of carbon dioxide by 
experiments also done at Bethesda.
<P>None of the mechanical aids for astronaut training could simulate more than a 
few of the conditions of space flight at a time. Even the seven Redstone 
ballistic flights, one planned for each astronaut, would be only partial 
simulations. Harold Johnson commented in February 1960 that the Redstone flights 
"may or may not be classified as training missions, depending on how sporting 
you may be." The astronauts were not only sporting in this regard, they were 
also chafing at delays. They suggested to Robert Gilruth that a rhesus monkey 
ride MR-1 so the schedule might be compressed enough to put the first chimp in 
orbit by the end of November.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>Perhaps the most impressive simulator, the whirligig called MASTIF (for 
Multiple Axis Space Test Inertia Facility), located at Lewis' cavernous altitude 
wind tunnel, was publicized far beyond its value as a training aid. Conceived in 
1959 by David S. Gabriel of Lewis as a rig to test space equipment in three 
degrees of rotational and two degrees of linear freedom, the idea of concentric 
gimbaled cages was translated into hardware in the altitude wind tunnel early in 
1959, when Lewis was assigned the job of testing Big Joe's attitude control 
system. Robert R. Miller directed the MASTIF project; Louis L. Corpas did the 
detail design work; and Frank Stenger developed the air-jet propulsion 
arrangement. Soon they had erected a tinker-toy-like rig 21 feet in diameter at 
its supporting yoke, capable of mounting a 3,000-pound space capsule inside its 
three sets of gimbals, and able to turn and tumble the whole combination in 
three axes simultaneously at 60 noisy revolutions per minute. An early trial 
revved the outer cage from zero to 50 revolutions per minute in half a turn.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
<P>James W. Useller, another mechanical engineer at Lewis, was first to see the 
potential in the MASTIF, if adapted, for astronaut training. Useller and a Lewis 
test pilot, Joseph S. Algranti, began taking cautious rides inside the MASTIF as 
soon as the controls engineers could spare it in mid-1959. They set up a formal 
test program for about 10 pilots and physiologists who wanted to see what 
rolling, pitching, and yawing at different speeds and for different lengths of 
time would do to a man. A thorough literature search revealed some similar 
late-19th-century German experiments, but Useller and Algranti proceeded to 
confirm a condition known as ocular nystagmus, an automatic flutter of the 
eyeballs induced by the acceleration of angular rotation. After extensive tests, 
they verified a rough [245] limit of tolerance at about 30 revolutions per 
minute in three axes; beyond this limit, even the most experienced pilots could 
expect to get sick.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
<P>Thus, in February 1960, when the first pair of astronauts, Grissom and 
Shepard, arrived in Cleveland for a week's stay to test the MASTIF and their 
reactions to it, extensive experience had already been accumulated by other 
pilots. After a hard night and a frustrating morning strapped in the seat while 
the MASTIF was being adjusted, Shepard again stepped inside the three large 
gimbal cages for his second sitting but first real ride in this machine. When 
MASTIF finally started to spin, Shepard turned green and pressed the red 
"chicken switch," sounding a claxon horn as a signal to stop. To control the 
nausea and vertigo induced by this maniacal carousel required dogged 
determination. The next day Shepard - and before the end of March all the 
astronauts - took examination runs at 30 revolutions per minute in all three 
axes and quickly learned, by using the hand controller, to activate nitrogen 
reaction motor brakes, to halt their rotation and bring themselves to a stop 
while the cages continued to spin. The confidence gained from this experience 
was invaluable, but one series on the MASTIF was enough. Reporters who watched a 
demonstration by Carpenter were vivid in their descriptions of the piercing 
scream, multicolored cages, and extraordinary contortions of MASTIF, billing it 
the ultimate in wild carnival rides.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>Far more important and critical was the second phase of the Johnsville 
centrifuge program, which began in mid-April to test much of the McDonnell 
hardware, including the couch and hand controller, instrument panel and full 
pressure suit, and the astronauts' responses to the dynamic simulation of the g 
profiles. An STG status report for April listed eight multiplex objectives of 
the ongoing centrifuge training program: (1) to test the retention by the 
astronaut of the straining technique and other skills developed in the August 
program; (2) to familiarize the astronauts with straining under reduced 
pressure; (3) to familiarize the astronauts with performing at high g levels in 
an inflated pressure suit; (4) to evaluate the couch manufactured by McDonnell 
Aircraft; (5) to evaluate the handcontroller developed by McDonnell; (6) to test 
proposed voice procedures under acceleration and reduced pressure; (7) to 
rehearse and evaluate the feasibility of a two-hour countdown period following 
astronaut insertion; and (8) to provide initial experience with Redstone 
acceleration patterns.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>With over 120 controls at his glove tips, including about 55 electrical 
switches, 30 fuses, and 35 mechanical levers, the astronaut had to learn a great 
deal regarding the monitoring and operation of these points of contact with his 
machine. From the prime contractor came a series of operating and maintenance 
manuals entitled "Service Engineering Department Reports," or "SEDRs" 
(pronounced "cedars"). The indoctrination manual had been replaced by a 
familiarization manual in the fall of 1959, and this in turn was replaced at the 
beginning of 1960 by SEDR No. 109, called the "Astronauts' Handbook." Although 
the first capsule [246] maintenance manual, SEDR No. 108, was not available 
until mid-year, it was not badly needed until the mass move to the Cape at that 
time.
<P>The "Astronauts' Handbook" set forth operating procedures in three sections: 
normal, emergency, and trouble-shooting activities. The checklist for procedures 
envisioned in a normal orbital mission at that time included 130 items expected 
of the astronaut, 69 of which were part of an extensive preflight interior 
inspection. Under emergency operations procedures, 156 items were listed as 
possible pilot actions in case of equipment malfunctions. The five phases of the 
mission - launch, orbit, reentry, descent, and landing - each required special 
responses to emergencies arising during that portion of the mission. Finally, 
the mechanics of five major subsystems of the capsule were outlined in the 
trouble-shooting section and then condensed into checklists for the reaction and 
environmental control systems and for the electrical and communication systems. 
The attitude stabilization and control system checklist was promised but was not 
yet available.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>As McDonnell technical writers prepared and revised the "Astronauts' 
Handbook," STG's operational plans were becoming systematized through concurrent 
revisions of its "General Systems Information Document." Lewis R. Fisher, Donald 
D. Arabian, William M. Bland, Jr., and Sigurd A. Sjoberg first published this 
basic guide as "Project Mercury Working Paper No. 118" in March 1960 and revised 
it twice within the next year. They outlined the general plans for the 
Mercury-Atlas and Mercury-Redstone missions, including overall test objectives, 
flight plans, capsule design criteria, description of the capsule and systems, 
and the general operational plan from prelaunch phase through recovery. Specific 
mission directives were based on this format, and the authors of most later 
working papers presupposed a familiarity with "Working Paper No. 118."<A

<P>While John Glenn and Walter Schirra studied the interrelations of the 
pressurized suit and the cockpit layout,McDonnell design engineers rearranged 
the Mercury control panel to place all controls in a U-shaped pattern around 
either side and below the instruments. When an astronaut's suit was inflated, he 
could reach the right side and bottom of the panel with his right hand, and his 
left hand could reach the left side and bottom, but the center and top of the 
panel were inaccessible. Since Mercury gloves were thicker and heavier than 
those on flying suits, all controls had to be positive in operation, including 
guards for pushbuttons and with key handles and pull rings designed for a good 
grip and the application of considerable force, up to 50 pounds in some cases.
<P>In their efforts to integrate man and-machine, psychologists Jones and Voas, 
among others, had shown by late spring 1960 how the reliability of Mercury could 
be increased by the use of man's flexibility. Using the pilot as a 
trouble-shooter engineer in many cases could make the difference between mission 
failure and success. Conversely, as man's limitations became more precisely 
known in relation to the equipment to be used, correspondingly higher standards 
for the automatic systems, particularly the attitude stabilization controls, 
were introduced. Voas later expressed a new consensus when he said: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>[247] The astronaut's primary job is to control the vehicle. The 
  astronaut is not a mere passenger, but an active controller of the vehicle who 
  performs an important and complex task which is basic to the total reliability 
  of the mission.
  <P>System flexibility is increased by provision for the use of more than one 
  of these [attitude control mode] systems at a time. Since the automatic 
  reaction jets and the manual reaction jets are completely independent, it is 
  possible for the man to exercise control through the manual jets while the 
  auto-pilot is exercising control through the automatic jets. One occasion for 
  use of both control systems would be in maneuvering in orbit when the 
  astronaut desires to let the autopilot control two axes such as roll and pitch 
  while he takes control in yaw.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source50"><SUP>50</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Meanwhile 
Jones and the human factors engineers at McDonnell were determining more ways in 
which man could back up other automatic malfunctions through their "failure task 
analysis." Using the failure mode predictions from [248] the design engineers' 
work on the reliability program, they elaborated "in detail the probable sensory 
output characteristics of the failure, the corrective responses required by the 
astronaut or ground monitor, and the failure effect."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-4.htm#source51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>Jones' human-factors team worked closely with McDonnell's Mercury reliability 
experts, Walter A. Harmon and Eugene A. Kunznick. They in turn allied themselves 
with another McDonnell crew employed on a special check of the Mercury 
reliability program instigated by NASA Headquarters. Programmers at McDonnell 
coded on punch cards all probable systemic failures; by June 1960 they had 
assembled massive computer printouts that detailed corrective actions an 
astronaut could take in case the robots should go wrong. They found that over a 
third of such failures would not show up on instruments or through warning 
lights, but could be detected through symptoms presenting unusual sights, 
sounds, smells, or vibrations. As many as 18 different failures, however, might 
show the same set of multiple cues, so the work of categorizing and organizing 
these data required another full year. Preliminary results from these 
cooperative studies helped early to isolate malfunctions that needed new 
indicators, to rank the frequency of instrument use, and to shape the training 
program. Efforts to predict the total system reliability by this evaluation 
intensified the debate over the "numbers game."<A

in spite of considerable opposition, that: "A rough estimate of the priority 
that should be given to each subsystem in the training program can be expressed 
as the reliability of the automatic component plus the estimated reliability for 
the human. Tasks associated with subsystems for where this sum is low should be 
assigned the highest priority in the training program. This procedure is similar 
to traditional task analysis procedures, but permits a more qualitative approach 
to the evaluation of design tradeoffs and the construction of training program."
