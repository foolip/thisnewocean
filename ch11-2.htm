<H1>Final Preparation for MR-3</H1>The Space Task Group had decided to train 
Shepard, Glenn, and Grissom especially for the MR-3 mission because the 
competitive field had to be narrowed for this particular mission to allow the 
remaining astronauts to prepare for ground support jobs and the Mercury-Atlas 
orbital missions. Shepard's activity chart for February 1961 shows that he spent 
18 days at Cape Canaveral becoming oriented to spacecraft No. 7 and its 
peculiarities. Long before the final phases of pilot preparations came about, 
Shepard and Walter C. Williams had insisted that the designated astronaut must 
become an integral part of the preflight checkout activities. So, based on this 
procedure, Shepard and Glenn acquired the special feel of No. 7's attitude 
control system in hangar checkouts. When the capsule was placed in the altitude 
test chamber, Shepard went along for the "ride" and exercised the environmental 
control system.
<P>The most valuable operational training the astronaut received before his 
mission came from sessions in two McDonnell-built, Link-type trainers, one at 
Langley and the other at the Cape. These devices were first called "procedures 
trainers" and later "Mercury simulators." Here the space pilot, supine in a 
mockup capsule, rehearsed the flight plan for a specific mission. The trainer 
instruments were capable of being tied in with computers at the Mercury Control 
Center. Overall operations team practice welded ground controllers and astronaut 
into a unit. Although not devoted exclusively to the MR-3 mission, the 
simulators were in use 55 to 60 hours a week during the three months preceding 
the flight of <I>Freedom 7</I>. During the entire training period, Shepard 
"flew" 120 simulated Mercury-Redstone flights.<A

<P>For an eight-week period immediately preceding the flight, the rehearsals 
became even more exacting. In preparing for the altitude chamber runs at space 
equivalent altitudes, the astronaut was examined in preflight physicals, fitted 
with medical sensors, including a rectal thermometer, and helped into his 
20-pound pressure suit. The pilot and his medical attendants then went through 
the mission as realistically as conditions would allow, conducting pressure and 
medical checks.
<P>Another carefully rehearsed phase of the program consisted of the transfer 
[345] of the pilot from his quarters on the balcony of Hangar S to the transfer 
van, the ride to the pad, and simulated flights with the astronaut sitting in 
the actual spacecraft. Countdowns were conducted while controllers manned their 
consoles. The first two rehearsal "flights," held on April 18 and 19, kept the 
service structure, or gantry, against the vehicle, and the capsule hatch was not 
closed. But the next day, on a third simulated mission, the hatch was closed, 
the gantry was pulled away, and the spacecraft was purged with oxygen as if an 
actual mission were in progress. Training like this and in the procedures 
trainer continued until two days before the scheduled flight.<A

<P>Three purposes were served by this extensive training program. The astronaut 
became intimately familiar with the role and voice of each person supporting the 
mission. He acquired more physical and mental familiarity with all of the 
associated hardware. And he was made even more aware of the day-to-day status 
leading to launch date. The operations team benefited by having the astronaut 
attend the team's technical briefings. These discussions covered both the 
spacecraft and the launch vehicle and included mission reviews held the week 
before launch.
<P>On the eve of the launch, a briefing was conducted exclusively for the 
astronaut, with specialists in each system reporting on final readiness. Walter 
J. Kapryan presented the capsule and booster status; Robert B. Voas reviewed 
astronaut flight tasks; Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., briefed the astronaut on 
flight control and network status; Robert F. Thompson told him of recovery 
procedures; and Ernest A. Amman gave him the forecast on weather conditions. 
Next morning, L. Gordon Cooper, blockhouse communicator, obtained reports from 
key operations personnel and gave the astronaut his final ready- room briefing 
before he ascended the gantry. Plans for the postflight debriefing sessions, 
wherein the student astronaut would become the teacher of his preflight 
instructors, were also laid out in detail by the end of April.<A

<P>The planning of recovery operations was as important as any other phase of 
the mission. Rear Admiral F. V. H. Hilles, in command of the experienced 
flotilla of eight destroyers known as DesFlotFour, worked with another flag 
officer, G. P. Koch, aboard the carrier <I>Lake Champlain</I>, on the tactics 
for this mission. STG's primary strategy was to recover both man and capsule by 
using land-based Marine helicopters for launch-site abort situations within 
about 80 miles of the Cape and carrier-based helicopters in the primary recovery 
area, within a hundred-mile radius. Makeup of the recovery force was similar to 
that for MR-2, with tiered groups of men and equipment, beginning at Cape 
Canaveral, ready to cover all contingencies - abort, normal flight, or 
overflight. The main recovery force of ships was deployed in an elongated 
pattern 500 miles down along the range. It consisted of the carrier, eight 
destroyers, and one Atlantic Missile Range radar tracking ship. The helicopters 
again were manned by Marine Air Group 26, a veteran recovery unit.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-2.htm#source8"><SUP>8</A></SUP>
<P>Some innovations were added to the recovery plans as a result of experience 
[346] gained in the MR-2 chimpanzee flight. For one thing, there was still the 
possibility that <I>Freedom 7</I> might overshoot its landing target, in which 
case the time factor could be vital. Obviously a highly mobile unit was 
desirable. Walter Williams, operations director, requested an amphibian SA-16 
aircraft with a pararescue team as an emergency rescue measure. Two such teams 
were provided, adding the support of the Air Rescue Service and Navy frogmen to 
Project Mercury.
<P>A second change involved communications. When the spacecraft was near impact 
it passed below the radio horizon; Williams reminded the Air Force Missile Test 
Center commander that continuous voice communications with the astronaut in the 
final moments of flight and after impact required a communications relay plane. 
The Air Force assigned a communications aircraft, code-named Cardfile 23, to the 
mission.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-2.htm#source9"><SUP>9</A></SUP>
<P>The helicopter recovery technique was perfected late during the astronaut 
preparation period. According to the original helicopter recovery procedures, 
the chopper would lift the spacecraft with the pilot inside and ferry both to 
the ship. John Glenn protested that the danger in this procedure to both 
astronaut and helicopter pilots was too great in case trouble developed during 
the operation. He strongly recommended further review. After much study and 
practice of procedures, STG decided at a conference on April 15, 1961, to use 
helicopters as the primary mode of recovery. The helicopter would arrive, hover 
over the spacecraft, and talk with the pilot by UHF. The helicopter copilot 
would snip off the capsule's high-frequency antenna, snare the capsule recovery 
loop, and raise the vehicle slightly out of the water. By this time the 
astronaut would be completely out of harness and the hatch would be clear of the 
water. Then the astronaut would open the side hatch, crawl through, and catch a 
second sling lowered from the helicopter. The helicopter would hoist both 
astronaut and spacecraft and carry them to the main recovery ship.<A

<P>Since a man was to be aboard this flight, another vital part of the planning 
activities involved weather reporting and surveillance. Beginning in June 1960, 
Francis W. Reichelderfer, chief of the United States Weather Bureau, had 
promised to Administrator Glennan and provided for the Space Task Group full 
meteorological support for Project Mercury. By mid-April 1961, a special weather 
support group, consisting of three units under Kenneth M. Nagler, was utilizing 
every resource of the Bureau (including the satellite <I>Tiros II</I>) to 
forecast the weather accurately for STG.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-2.htm#source11"><SUP>11</A></SUP>
<P>Before MR-3, the seven-man Miami forecast unit, headed by Jesse R. Gulick, 
analyzed reconnaissance data on weather conditions for 200 miles beyond the 
planned launch and recovery areas. Weather Bureau aircraft from Miami overflew 
the area at altitudes of 5000 to 20,000 feet, then, three hours before launch, 
dipped down below 1500 feet. The flight plan followed a box pattern, with the 
amount of surveillance dictated by weather conditions at a particular point. The 
recovery ships were integrated into a weather-reporting mission, [347] making 
reports at assigned times and providing special surface observations, such as 
sea state and wind velocity, at the critical time near launch. Weather observers 
at the launch site also kept a careful watch on air and seawater temperatures, 
relative humidity, cloud cover, and winds.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-2.htm#source12"><SUP>12</A></SUP>
<P>As the flight date neared, STG personnel briefed the ship crews of the 
recovery force. Martin A. Byrnes, Robert Thompson, and Charles I. Tynan, Jr., of 
STG found the naval crews not wholly trained in the specifics of this particular 
mission. So they immediately initiated a brief education program, giving talks, 
providing reading material, and showing motion pictures of the MR-2 chimpanzee 
flight. Tynan also carefully briefed each man charged with capsule-handling 
duties on his particular role. To cradle the recovered capsule the Navy had 
constructed 20- by-25-foot dollies and topped them with old mattresses. Then 
aeromedical teams arrived, prepared sick bay areas, and briefed the ships' 
medical personnel. After one medical group found that two members of one of the 
destroyers had recently contracted hepatitis, the crew members of that ship were 
barred from donating blood, even in an emergency. Byrnes, who felt that the 
recovery-force briefings should become standard procedure for succeeding 
flights, said that the Navy was pleased with the pep talks.<A
