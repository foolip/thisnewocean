From Design into Development<BR><BR>
<SPAN>(January&ndash;June 1959)</SPAN></H2>
<P>[133] From dreams into definitions and from design
into development, the idea for a manned satellite was growing toward fruition.
During the first half of 1959, the Space Task Group (STG) guided the translation
of its conceptual designs into detailed developmental plans for the molding of
hardware. Creating an engineering program, planning precisely the flight
missions, organizing men, money, and material to fulfill those missions, and
establishing technical policy and managerial responsibility were the prime
necessities of the moment. But this year began with the realization of a Russian
"dream," <I>Mechta</I>.
<P>On January 2, 1959, the Soviets announced they had successfully launched a
rocket toward the Moon, the final stage of which weighed 3245 pounds, including
almost 800 pounds of payload instrumentation inside its spherical shell. The
Soviet <I>Mechta</I>, also popularly called <I>Lunik I</I>, was the first
man-made object to attain the 25,000-mile-per-hour speed needed to break away
from Earth's gravitational field. By comparison the United States Moon probe
<I>Pioneer III</I>, launched by a four-stage Jupiter called Juno II on December
6, 1958, had weighed 13 pounds and attained a velocity of 24,000 miles per hour.
And though it missed its target, <I>Lunik I</I> flashed past Earth's natural
satellite to become the first successful "deep space" (i.e., translunar) probe
and the first man-made artifact to become a solar satellite.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>While <I>Mechta</I> presumably went into solar orbit, and even while many
incredulous Americans refused to accept this impressive claim, NASA mobilized
for the national effort to catch up with the Soviets in propulsion and guidance,
and in progress toward manned space flight. The project named Mercury embodied
the latter half of those hopes.
<P>Robert R. Gilruth and his STG associates at Langley, together with Abe
Silverstein and others in Washington, plunged knowingly into one of the greatest
engineering adventures of all time. Somewhat self-conscious in the role of men
of action setting out to do what had never been done before, they tried to match
means to their ends without too much introspection and by avoiding useless [134]
worries over comparative scores in the space race. Like all good engineers, they
were also professors of efficiency. They committed themselves to do their unique
task as effectively, economically, and quickly as possible. But the inexorable
conflict between the novelty of the experiment and the experience with novelty
that alone can lead to efficiency they had to accept as an occupational hazard.
Two of their ideals - to perform orbital flight safely and to perform it with
economy - were embodied in preliminary designs for Project Mercury long before
those same ideals became obligations during the development of the program.
Their third ideal - timeliness - gradually became crushed between performance
and cost considerations.
<P>In the hectic three months of planning and procurement from September 1958 to
January 1959, the original "objectives and basic plan" for Project Mercury
gradually clarified by abbreviation to an itemized list. Continued reiteration
throughout preliminary development (January through June 1959) finally reduced
the aims, attitudes, and means of the Space Task Group to a set of nominative
formulas used again and again as "Slide No. 1" in briefings:

basic doctrine for Project Mercury remained essentially unchanged throughout the
entire life of the program. Although the managers of Mercury found this a source
of considerable pride, they were forced to make certain departures from their
basic principles and to refine their methods continually.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
The techniques and technology for landing, for example, were not specified this
early. The efforts to ensure a safe touchdown, on water instead of land, became
a critical concern over a year later.

<H3>Brickbat Priority</H3>From the beginning STG had sought to obtain the
Nation's highest priority for the manned satellite program. But the White House,
Congress, and NASA Headquarters at first regarded as equally important the
development of a "10<SUP>6</SUP>," [135] or one-million-pound-thrust, booster
engine, and the elaboration of space sciences through the continuation of
instrumented satellite programs similar to Vanguard. Hugh L. Dryden initiated a
request to the Department of Defense as early as November 14, 1958, to put the
"manned satellite and the one-million-pound-thrust engine" in the DOD Master
Urgency List alongside the Minuteman and Polaris weapon systems. But the
National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC) had deferred this request on
December 3, pending a scheduled meeting the next week of the Civilian-Military
Liaison Committee (CMLC). The Space Council did recommend that NASA assign its
highest in-house priority to Project Mercury. When it met, the Liaison Committee
recommended the "DX," or highest industrial procurement priority, for the manned
satellite. They assumed that the Vanguard and Jupiter-C projects would be
dropped from that category and that the million-pound-thrust engine would be
assigned the next lower, or a "DO," priority.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>New additions to the DX list required the approval of the National Security
Council, but earlier that body had delegated authority to the Secretary of
Defense to decide on top priorities for satellite systems. Secretary Neil H.
McElroy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff received the Liaison Committee's
recommendations for a new Master Urgency List on December 17. NASA Administrator
T. Keith Glennan protested to William M. Holaday, the Pentagon's Director of
Guided Missiles and chairman of the Liaison Committee, that not only Mercury but
the big new booster, to become known in February as the Saturn, should have top
priority. McElroy therefore directed Holaday to review the entire DX category
before deciding what to do about the dual NASA requests for the so-called
"brickbat," or highest, priority rating.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
Here matters stood at the end of the year.
<P>For these reasons, financial allowances for extensive (and expensive)
overtime work and the authorization for preferential acquisition of scarce
materials were delayed well into 1959. Maxime A. Faget's optimistic belief
before the program started that a man might possibly be placed in orbit within
18 months, or during the second quarter of the calendar year 1960, depended upon
the immediate assignment of the Nation's highest priority to Mercury - and an
enormous amount of the best possible luck! One of the first official estimates
of the launch schedule for STG, made by Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., in early
December for the Air Force Missile Test Center at Cape Canaveral predicted
concurrent development, qualification, and manned orbital flights from April
through September in 1960.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
This "guesstimate" was likewise predicated on an immediate Defense Department
order to allow Project Mercury to compete "on a non-interference basis" with the
military missile programs in obtaining critical "off-the-shelf" components,
particularly electronic and guidance items.
<P>By the first of the new year, it was fairly clear that the large Saturn
booster would be continued by the Army's Wernher von Braun team and that the
Defense Department was not about to release von Braun and his associates to
NASA. Glennan, Dryden, and Silverstein had given Project Mercury the highest
priority [136] within NASA itself, but among industrial suppliers and the
Defense Department it ranked second to several more urgent and competing
demands. By March 1959, definite evidence of equipment and material supply
shortages accumulated. The new prime contractor warned of delivery schedule
slippages resulting from Mercury's DO rating. Holaday's reports were favorable
toward Mercury, and Glennan compromised on the "10<SUP>6</SUP>-engines." For the
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) had directed the Army Ordnance Missile
Command and the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, respectively, to start
independent development of both a clustered first-stage booster (the Saturn) and
a single-chamber rocket engine (the F-1) able to generate about 1,500,000 pounds
of thrust.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
<P>So NASA finally presented a united front with the Defense Department to the
President and Congressional committees. On April 27, 1959, Eisenhower himself
approved the request for the "brickbat" procurement rating for Mercury. The
prime contract and most of the major subcontracts for the space capsule had been
let well before May 4, when Mercury was officially listed in the topmost
category on the Master Urgency List.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
But the attendant privilege of not having to seek the lowest bidder on every
major item bought was probably less important to the development of the program
than the added prestige and support the DX rating brought to Mercury within the
aerospace industry and among the military services.
<P>During the first quarter of 1959, confusion reigned in Washington aerospace
circles as too many missile czars, too many space projects, and too many
agencies clamored for more funds and support. But journalists, scientists, and
humanitarians applauded the successes of the Navy-NASA <I>Vanguard II</I>, a
tiny weather satellite; of the Air Force's <I>Discoverer I</I>, first satellite
in polar orbit; and of the Army-NASA <I>Pioneer IV</I>, which managed to
duplicate <I>Mechta's</I> escape velocity. As a deep-space probe and the first
U.S. solar satellite, <I>Pioneer IV</I>, launched March 3, was magnificently
instrumental in expanding man's knowledge of the plurality of the Van Allen
radiation belts and of the "solar winds," or radiation storms, that permeate
interplanetary space. Glennan had resolved to identify all NASA booster rockets
with the name "United States" only, but other rocket agencies within the
government were unlikely to follow suit. In the midst of all this, Project
Mercury seemed still an obscure conception to the public. Roy W. Johnson of ARPA
called it "very screwball" when first proposed; by the end of March he said, "It
looks a little less screwball now."<A
href="notes.htm#n6.8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile, within STG itself, the most urgent task in getting on with the
program had already been accomplished by the end of 1958. On December 29 the
Task Group had completed its technical assessments of the industrial proposals
for manufacturing the capsule and its subsystems. Eleven complete proposals had
been received. The narrowing of the field of possible manufacturers was
facilitated by the fact that so many alternate configurations were submitted.
Faget had invited the bidders "to submit alternate capsule and configuration
designs if you so desire, provided that you incorporate the retrorocket
principle, [137] the non-lifting principle and the non-ablating heat sink
principle. You are not limited to this particular approach only."<A
href="notes.htm#n6.9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
But some of the bidders had taken him altogether too literally in this
statement.

<H3>Awarding the Prime Contract</H3>During the first week in January, another
group of men, led by Carl Schreiber at NASA Headquarters, evaluated the
procurement aspects of the competitive proposals. This Management, Cost, and
Production Assessment Committee was required to rank only eight companies,
because four had been disqualified on purely technical grounds. By January 6,
four companies were reported to the Source Selection Board as having outstanding
management capabilities for the prime contract. But in the final analysis Abe
Silverstein and the six members of his board had to decide between only two
firms with substantially equal technical and managerial excellence: Grumman
Aircraft Engineering Corporation and McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. The NASA
Administrator himself eventually explained the principal reason for the final
choice:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The reason for choosing McDonnell over Grumman was the fact that
  Grumman was heavily loaded with Navy projects in the conceptual stage. It did
  not appear wise to select Grumman in view of its relatively tight manpower
  situation at the time, particularly since that situation might be reflected in
  a slow start on the capsule project regardless of priority. Moreover, serious
  disruption in scheduling Navy work might occur if the higher priority capsule
  project were awarded to Grumman.<A
  href="notes.htm#n6.10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>NASA
informed McDonnell on January 12 that it had been chosen the prime contractor
for the Mercury spacecraft. Contract negotiations began immediately; after three
more weeks of working out the legal and technical details, the stickiest of
which was the fee, the corporation's founder and president, James S. McDonnell,
Jr., signed on February 5, 1959, three originals of a contract.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
This document provided for an estimated cost of $18,300,000 and a fee of
$1,150,000. At the time, it was a small part of McDonnell's business and a
modest outlay of government funds, but it officially set in motion what
eventually became one of the largest technical mobilizations in American
peacetime history. Some 4000 suppliers, including 596 direct subcontractors
from 25 states and over 1500 second-tier subcontractors, soon came in to assist
in the supply of parts for the capsule alone.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>The prime contract was incompletely entitled "Research and Development
Contract for Designing and Furnishing Manned Satellite Capsule." The omission of
an article before the word "manned" and the lack of the plural form for the word
"capsule" prefigured what was to happen within the next five months. The
original contract began evolving with the program, so that instead of 12
capsules of identical design, as first specified, 20 spacecraft, each
individually designed for a specific mission and each only superficially like
the others, were produced by McDonnell. Contract change proposals, or "CCPs," as
they were [138] known, quickly grew into supplemental agreements that were to
overshadow the prime contract itself.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>The relative roles of STG and McDonnell engineers in pushing the state of the
art from design into construction are difficult to assess. Cross-fertilization
of ideas and, after the contract was awarded, almost organically close teamwork
in implementing them characterized the STG-McDonnell relationship. For a year
before the company's selection as prime contractor, original design studies had
been carried on with company funds. From a group of 12 engineers led by Raymond
A. Pepping, Albert Utsch, Lawrence M. Weeks, and John F. Yardley in January
1958, the Advanced Design section at McDonnell grew to about 40 people by the
time the company submitted its proposal to NASA. The proposal itself stated that
the company already had invested 32 man-years of effort in the design for a
manned satellite, and the elaborate three-volume prospectus amply substantiated
the claim.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>In STG's 50-page set of final "Specifications for a Manned Space Capsule,"
drawn up in November, Faget and associates had described in remarkable detail
their expectations of what the capsule and some 15 subsystems should be like.
Now the McDonnell production engineers set about expanding the preliminary
specifications, filling gaps in the basic design, preparing blueprints and
specification control drawings, and retooling their factory for the translation
of ideas into tangible hardware. Specification S-6 had enjoined the contractor
to provide at his plant as soon as possible a mockup, or full-scale model made
of plywood and cardboard, of the capsule system. With high expectations the Task
Group awaited March 17, the date by which McDonnell had promised to have ready
their detailed specifications and a dummy Mercury capsule and escape tower.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
But the debut was not to be achieved easily.
<P>Before the company could finish building the mockup, at least two technical
questions affecting the configuration had to be resolved: one was the type of
heatshield to be used; the other was the exact design for the escape system. A
third detail, the shape of the antenna canister and drogue chute housing atop
the cylindrical afterbody, was also tentative when STG and McDonnell engineers
began to work together officially on January 12, 1959.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>

<H3>Heatshield Resolution</H3>To begin with, all capsule proposals had been
evaluated on the basis of a beryllium heat sink, but the search for an ablating
heatshield continued concurrently. George M. Low reported the tentative
resolution of this conflict in late January:
<BLOCKQUOTE>At a meeting held at Langley Field on January 16 (attended by Drs.
  Dryden and Silverstein), it was decided to negotiate with McDonnell to design
  the capsule so that it can be fitted with either a beryllium heat sink or an
  ablation heat shield. It was further decided that McDonnell should supply
  [139] a specified number (of the order of eight) ablation shields and a
  specified number (of the order of six) beryllium heat sinks. It is anticipated
  that flights with both types of heat protection will be made . . . . In case
  of a recovery on land, the capsule with a beryllium heat sink will require
  cooling; this is accomplished by circulating air either between the heat sink
  and the pressure vessel, or by ventilating the pressure vessel after impact.<A
  href="notes.htm#n6.17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Regarding
the escape system, McDonnell's proposal had carefully weighed the relative
merits of STG's pylon, or tower, type of tractor rocket with the alternative
idea, which used three sets of dual-pod pusher rockets, similar to JATO bottles,
along either side of three fins at the base of the capsule. McDonnell chose the
latter system for its design proposal, but the STG idea prevailed through the
contract negotiations, because the Redstone was calculated to become
aerodynamically unstable with the pod-type escape system, and the Atlas would
likely be damaged by jettisoning the pod fins.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
The escape system for an aborted launch was intimately interrelated with the
problems of the heatshield and of the normal, or nominal, landing plans. By
mid-March Robert F. Thompson's detailed proposals for a water landing helped
clarify the nature of the test programs to be conducted.
<P>While McDonnell agreed to design the capsule so that it could be fitted
alternatively with either a beryllium heat sink or an ablation heatshield, the
prime contractor farmed the fabrication of these elements to three
subcontractors: Brush Beryllium Company of Cleveland was to forge six heat-sink
heatshields; General Electric Company and Cincinnati Testing and Research
Laboratory (CTL) were to fabricate 12 ablation shields. The Space Task Group
relied on Andre J. Meyer, Jr., to monitor this critical and sensitive problem,
the solution to which would constitute the foremost technological secret in the
specifications for the manned capsule.
<P>Meyer, one of the original STG members from Lewis in Cleveland, had been
commuting to Langley for 10 months. He soon discovered a bottleneck in the
industrial availability of beryllium. Only two suppliers were found in this
country; only one of these, Brush, had as yet successfully forged ingots of
acceptable purity. But ablation technology was equally primitive, so plans had
to be made on dual tracks. Meyer had had much experience with laminated plastics
for aircraft structures. He had previously learned, in consultations with the
Cincinnati Testing Laboratory, how to design a "shingle layup" for fabrication
of an ablation heatshield. While collecting all available information on both
the ablative plastic and the beryllium industries, Meyer listened to the Big Joe
project engineers, Aleck C. Bond and Edison M. Fields. They argued for ablation,
specifically for a fiber glass-phenolic material, as the primary heat protection
for the astronaut. Before moving to Virginia in February, Meyer consulted on
weekends with Brush Beryllium in Cleveland, watching its pioneering progress in
forging ever larger spherical sections of the exotic metal, which is closely
akin to the precious gem emerald. But Meyer, along with Bond and Fields, grew
more skeptical [140] of the elegant theoretical deductions that supported the
case for beryllium. Mercury would have a shallow angle of entry and consequently
a long heat duration and high total heat; they worried about the possibility
that any heat sink might "pressure cook" the occupant of the capsule. So Meyer,
using CTL's shingle concept, perfected his designs for an ablative shield.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>There was something basically appealing about the less tidy ablation
principle, something related to a basic principle in physics, where the heat
necessary to change the state (from solid to liquid to gas) of a material is
vastly greater than the heat absorbed by that material in raising its
temperature by degrees. Meyer became convinced by March that beryllium would be
twice as expensive and only half as safe. Consequently, Meyer and Fields
concentrated their efforts on proving their well-grounded intuition that
ablation technology could be brought to a workable state before the Big Joe shot
in early summer.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>While lively technical discussions over ablation versus heat sink continued
through the spring, the fact that Mercury officials had committed Big Joe to the
proof-testing of an ablative shield also rather effectively squelched any
further attempts at scientific comparisons. Whereas in January Paul E. Purser
recorded that "we will procure both ablation and beryllium shields . . . and
neither will be 'backup,' they will be 'alternates,'" by the end of April
technological difficulties in manufacturing the prototype ablation shields
became so acute as to monopolize the attention of cognizant STG engineers.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>Glennan and Silverstein in Headquarters therefore directed continuation of
the heat sink development as insurance, while STG gradually consigned the
alternative beryllium shield to the role of substitute even before the fiber
glass-phenolic shield had proved its worth. By mid-year of 1959, apparently only
the Brush Beryllium Company still felt confident that the metallic heat sponge
was a viable alternative to the glass heat vaporizer in protecting the man in
space from the fate of a meteor. The complicated glass-cloth fabricating and
curing problems for the ablation shield were mostly conquered by July. John H.
Winter, the heatshield project coordinator at the Cincinnati Testing Laboratory,
delivered his first ablation shield to NASA in Cleveland on June 22 under heavy
guard.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>The critical question of whether to jettison the heatshield was active early
in 1959. If the shield were a heat sink, it would be so hot by the time it
reached the lower atmosphere that to retain it after the main parachute had
deployed would be hazardous to the pilot. Also in case of a dry landing such a
hot sponge could easily start a prairie or forest fire. On the other hand, a
detachable shield would add complexity to the system and increase the risk of
its loss before performing its reentry job. In one of the early airdrops a
jettisoned shield actually went into "a falling leaf pattern after detachment.
It glided back and collided with the capsule, presenting an obvious potential
hazard for the pilot in his vehicle late in the reentry cycle."<A
href="notes.htm#n6.23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
This incident prompted the decision that the heatshield would be retained,
although it might very well be lowered in the final moments of the flight if it
could help attenuate impact. The memory of this early collision [141] after
jettisoning continued to haunt STG engineers until they rejected the beryllium
heat-sink shield altogether.
<P>Although the heatshield problem was highly debatable at the inception of the
project, there was consolation in the fact that at least two major development
areas were virtually complete. The two items considered frozen at the end of
January 1959 were the external configuration of the capsule, except for the
antenna section, and the form-fitting couch in which the astronaut would be able
to endure a force of 20 g or more, if it should come to that.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
The Space Task Group was pleased to have something as accomplished fact when so
many other areas were still full of uncertainties.
<P>To George Low's ninth weekly status report for Administrator Glennan on STG's
progress and plans for Project Mercury was appended a tabular flight test
schedule that summarized the program and mission planning as envisioned in
mid-March 1959. Five Little Joe flights, eight Redstone, two Jupiter, ten Atlas
flights, and two balloon ascents were scheduled, the categories overlapping each
other from July 1959 through January 1961. The first manned ballistic suborbital
flight was designated Mercury-Redstone flight No. 3, or simply "MR-3," to be
launched about April 26, 1960. And the first manned orbital flight, designated
Mercury-Atlas No. 7, or "MA-7," was targeted for September 1, 1960. After that,
STG hoped to fly several more, progressively longer orbital missions, leading
finally to 18 orbits or a full day for man in space. Although merely a possible
flight test plan, this schedule set a superhuman pace and formed the basis for
NASA's earliest expectations.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>

<H3>Applied Research</H3>By March 1, Langley Research Center was formally
supporting the Task Group in conducting five major programs of experimentation.
The first was an airdrop study, begun the previous summer, to determine the
aerodynamic behavior of the capsule in free fall and under restraint by various
kinds of parachute suspension. By early January more than a hundred drops of
drums filled with concrete and of model capsules had produced a sizable amount
of evidence regarding spacecraft motion in free falls, spiraling and tumbling
downward, with and without canopied brakes, to impacts on both sea and land.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
But what specific kind of a parachute system to employ for the final letdown
remained a separate and debatable question.
<P>A second group of experiments sought to prove the workability of the escape
system designs in shots at Wallops Island. On March 11 the first "pad abort," a
full-scale escape-rocket test, ended in a disappointing failure. After a
promising liftoff the Recruit tractor-rocket, jerking the boilerplate spacecraft
skyward, suddenly nosed over, made two complete loops, and plunged into the
surf.
<P>So disappointing was this test that for several weeks the fin-stabilized pod
rocket escape system was almost reinstituted.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
Three Langley engineers, [142] chagrined by this threat to their work, conducted
a full postmortem following the recovery of the capsule. They blamed the erratic
behavior on a graphite liner that had blown out of one of the three exhaust
nozzles. Willard S. Blanchard, Jr., Sherwood Hoffman, and James R. Raper,
working frantically for a month, were able to perfect and prove out their design
of the escape rocket nozzles by mid-April. At the same time they improved the
pitch-rate of the system by deliberately misaligning the pylon about one inch
off the capsule's centerline.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>The third applied research program was a series of exhaustive wind-tunnel
investigations at Langley and at the Ames Research Center to fill in data on
previously unknown values in blunt-body stability at various speeds, altitudes,
and angles of attack. Model Mercury capsules of all sizes, including some
smaller than .22 rifle bullets, were tested for static-stability lift, drag, and
pitch in tunnels. Larger models were put into free flight to determine
dynamic-stability characteristics. Vibration and flutter tests were conducted
also in tunnels. The variable location of the center of gravity was of critical
interest here, as was also the shifting meta-center of buoyancy.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<P>Using the thunderous forced-draft wind tunnels at Langley and Ames,
aeronautical research engineers pored over schlieren photographs of shock waves,
windstreams, boundary layers, and vortexes. Most of the NASA tunnel scientists
had long been airplane men, committed to "streamlined" thinking. Now that H.
Julian Allen's blunt-body concept was to be used to bring a man back from 100
miles up and travelling about five miles per second, both thought and facilities
had to be redirected toward making Mercury safe and stable.
<P>Albin O. Pearson was one such airplane-tunnel investigator who was forced to
change his way of thinking and his tools by the ever higher mach number research
program for Mercury. Pearson worked at Langley coordinating all aerodynamic
stability tests for Mercury with blunt models at trans-, super-, and hypersonic
speeds. While exhausting the local facilities for his transonic static stability
studies, Pearson arranged for Dennis F. Hasson, Steve Brown, Kenneth C. Weston,
and other Langley, STG, and McDonnell aerodynamicists to use various Air Force
tunnels at the Arnold Engineering Development Center, in Tullahoma, Tennessee.
Beginning on April 9, 1959, a number of Mercury models and escape configurations
were tested in the 16-foot propulsion wind tunnel and 40-inch (mach 22
capability) "Hot Shot" facility at Tullahoma. During the next 16 months a total
of 103 investigations utilizing 28 different test facilities were made in the
wind-tunnel program.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
<P>A fourth experiment program concerned specifically the problem of landing
impact. Ideally touchdown should occur at a speed of no more than 30 feet per
second, but how to ensure this and how to guard against impacts in directions
other than vertical were exasperating problems. Landing-loads tests in
hydrodynamics laboratories for the alternative water landing had only begun. The
anticipated possibility of a ground impact, which would be far more serious,
demanded shock absorbers far better than any yet devised. Although there was
[143] still no assurance that the astronaut inside a floating capsule could
crawl out through the throat without its capsizing, this egress problem was less
demanding at the moment than the need for some sort of crushable material to
absorb the brunt of a landing on land.
<P>Through April and May, McDonnell engineers fitted a series of four Yorkshire
pigs into contour couches for impact landing tests of the crushable aluminum
honeycomb energy-absorption system. These supine swine sustained acceleration
peaks from 38 to 58 g before minor internal injuries were noted. The "pig drop"
tests were quite impressive, both to McDonnell employees who left their desks
and lathes to watch them and to STG engineers who studied the documentary
movies. But, still more significant, seeing the pigs get up and walk away from
their forced fall and stunning impact vastly increased the confidence of the
newly chosen astronauts that they could do the same. The McDonnell report on
these experiments concluded, "Since neither the acceleration rates nor shock

<P>Fifth, and finally, other parachute experiments for spacecraft descent were
of major concern in the spring of 1959, because neither the drogue chute for
stabilization nor the main landing parachute was yet qualified for its task in
Project Mercury. Curiously, little research had been done on parachute behavior
at extremely high altitudes. Around 70,000 feet, where the drogue chute was at
first designed to open, and down to about 10,000 feet, where the main landing
chute should deploy, tests had to be carried out to measure "snatch" forces,
shock forces, and stability parameters. Some peculiar phenomena - called
"squidding," "breathing," and "rebound" in the trade - were soon discovered
about parachute behavior at high altitude and speed. In March, one bad failure
of an extended-skirt cargo chute to open fully prompted a thorough review of the
parachute development program. Specialists from the Air Force, Langley,
McDonnell, and Radioplane, a division of the Northrop Corporation, met together
in April and decided to abandon the extended-skirt chute in favor of a newly
proved, yet so far highly reliable, 63-foot-diameter ringsail canopy. The size,
deployment, and reliability of the drogue chute remained highly debatable while
STG sought outside help to acquire other parachute test facilities.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
The status of most other major capsule systems was still flexible enough to
accommodate knowledge and experience gained through ongoing tests.

<DIV class="figure">
<IMG src="t145.jpg">
<P class="caption">Parachute development and qualification was one of the
areas that proved surprisingly time-consuming and troublesome, considering the
long prior history of parachute use. The ring-sail parachute, shown at right in
one of many test flights, was the type finally chosen to use as the capsule's
main parachute.</P>
</DIV>

<P>Two other major problems on which Langley also worked with STG, while NASA
Headquarters planned the role and functions of the new center in Beltsville,
concerned the formulation of final landing and recovery procedures and the
establishment of a worldwide tracking network. Mercury planners had assumed from
the beginning that the Navy could play a primary role in locating and retrieving
the capsule and its occupant after touchdown. But a parallel assumption that
existing military and International Geophysical Year tracking [145] and
communications facilities could be utilized with relatively slight modifications
had to be overhauled in the light of a more thorough analysis of Mercury
requirements.

<P>The Navy's experience with search and rescue operations at sea could be
trusted to apply directly without much modification to retrieval of the Mercury
capsule. But a multitude of safeguards had to be incorporated in the capsule to
ensure its safety during and immediately after impact and to reduce the time
required for recovery to a bare minimum. William C. Muhly, STG's shop planner
and scheduler, was most worried about these recovery aids for the Big Joe
tests.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
<P>The most serious technical decision affecting the landing and recovery
procedures concerned the feasibility of using an impact bag to cushion the
sudden stop at the surface of Earth. Gilruth liked the idea of using a crushable
honeycomb of metal foil between the shield and the pressure vessel to act as the
primary shock absorber. But a pneumatic bag, perhaps a large inner tube or a
torus made of fabric and extending below the capsule, either with or without the
heatshield as its base, was still appealing. Associated with the recovery
problem [146] were innumerable other factors related to recovery operations. The
seaworthiness of the capsule, its stability in a rough sea, the kinds of beacons
and signaling devices to be used, and the provisions for the possibility of a
dry landing were foremost among these worries.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>The second major area of uncertainty revealed in January 1959 came as
something of a surprise to Task Group people. They had assumed that the world
was fairly well covered with commercial, military, and scientific
telecommunications networks that could be a basis for the Mercury tracking and
communications grid. The Minitrack network established roughly north and south
along the 75th meridian in the Western Hemisphere for Project Vanguard turned
out to be practically inapplicable. On the other hand, the "Moonwatch" program
and the optical tracking teams using Baker-Nunn cameras developed by the
Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Laboratory supplied invaluable data during
1958. Tracking of artificial satellites showed that all previous estimates of
atmospheric density were on the low side.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>Trajectory studies for equatorial orbits showed a remarkable lack of radio
and cable installations along the projected track. Much depended upon the
precise trajectory selections and orbital calculations for a Mercury-Atlas
combination. New Atlas guidance equations that would convert the ballistic
missile into an orbital launch vehicle had been assigned to the mathematicians
of Space Technology Laboratories (STL) in Los Angeles. But whatever these turned
out to be, it was becoming apparent that the world was far less well-wired
around the middle and underside than had been thought. Furthermore the medical
teams were insisting on continuous voice contact with the pilot. So by the end
of February, Charles W. Mathews had convinced Abe Silverstein that STG should be
relieved of the monumental tracking job, and NASA Headquarters drafted another
contingent of Langley men to set up a brand-new communications girdle around the
world.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>A large part of the Instrument Research Division at Langley, under the
directorship of Hartley A. Soul&eacute;, provided the manpower. Soul&eacute; had previously
laid out a timetable of 18 months for completion of a tracking network. Now he
and the Langley Procurement Officer, Sherwood L. Butler, undertook to manage the
design and procurement of material for its construction.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
Ray W. Hooker accepted the supervision of the mechanical and architectural
engineering, and G. Barry Graves began to direct the electronics engineering. By
mid-March the problem of providing a tracking network for Mercury was on the
shoulders of a special task unit that came to be known as the Tracking and
Ground Instrumentation Unit, or by the barbarous acronym "TAGIU." Although by
this time most of the other divisions at Langley were also acting partially in
support of Mercury, the Tracking Unit held a special position in direct support
of the Space Task Group. Indirectly it provided NASA with its first equatorial
tracking web for all artificial satellites. Some 35 people in the unit went to
work immediately on their biggest problem, described by Graves as "simply to
decide what all had to be done."<A
href="notes.htm#n6.38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
By the end of April, Soul&eacute; had seen the imperative [148] need for a high order
of political as well as technical statesmanship to accomplish his task on time.
A detailed report to Silverstein outlined his operational plans.<A

<P>On March 17 and 18, 1959, at the McDonnell plant in St. Louis, the
manufacturers presented to the Space Task Group for its review, inspection, and
approval the first full-scale mockup of the complete Project Mercury manned
satellite capsule. This "Mockup Review Inspection" represented a rough dividing
line between the design and development phases for the project. The "Detail
Specifications," 80 pages in length, provided a program for the customers.
Another McDonnell document provided a written description of the "crew station"
procedures and capabilities. And the mockup itself showed the configuration
"exploded" into seven component parts: adapter ring, retrorocket package,
heatshield bottom, pressure bulkhead, airframe, antenna canister, and escape
rocket pylon.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>The chief designers, constructors, and managers of the program gathered
around the capsule to watch demonstrations of pilot entry, pilot mobility,
accessibility of controls, pylon removal, adapter separation, and pilot escape.
The board of inspection, chaired by Charles H. Zimmerman, then Chief of the
Engineering and Contract Administration Division of STG, included Gilruth,
Mathews, Faget, Low, Walter C. Williams, who was then still Chief of NASA's High
Speed Flight Station, and E. M. Flesh, the engineering manager of Project
Mercury for McDonnell. In addition, eight official advisers of the board and 16
observers from various other interested groups attended the meeting. The
president of the corporation himself introduced his chief lieutenants: Logan T.
MacMillan, company-wide project manager; John Yardley, chief project engineer;
and Flesh. In consultation during the two days with some 40 McDonnell engineers,
the Task Group recommended a total of 34 items for alteration or study. Of these
recommendations 25 were approved immediately by the board, and the rest were
assigned to study groups.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
<P>Among the significant changes approved at this meeting were the addition of a
side escape hatch, window shades, steps or reinforced surfaces to be used as
steps in climbing out of the throat of the capsule, and a camera for
photographing the astronaut. Robert A. Champine, a Langley test pilot who had
ridden the centrifuge with Carter C. Collins and R. Flanagan Gray the previous
summer to help prove the feasibility of the Faget couch concept, suggested more
than 20 minor changes in instrumentation displays and the placement of switches,
fuses, and other controls. Also attending this mockup review were Brigadier
General Don D. Flickinger; W. Randolph Lovelace II; Gordon Vaeth, the new
representative of the Advanced Research Projects Agency; John P. Stapp, the Air
Force physician who had proved that man could take deceleration impacts of up to
40 g; and a relatively obscure Marine test pilot from the Navy Bureau of
Aeronautics by the name of John H. Glenn, Jr.

<P>When they returned to Langley Field, Task Group officials were aware as never
before of the magnitude of their tasks. Conversations with more than 50
[149] McDonnell engineering group leaders had convinced them that more formal
contract-monitoring arrangements were needed. Working committees and study
groups had proliferated to such an extent that a capsule-coordination panel was
needed. Gilruth appointed John H. Disher in mid-March to head the coordination
temporarily. But by mid-June the panel was upgraded to an "office" and Disher
was recalled to Washington by Silverstein to work with Low and Warren J.
North.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
<P>From a nucleus of 35 people assigned to STG in October 1958, the Group had
grown to 150 by the end of January 1959. Six months later, in July, about 350
people were working in or with the Task Group, although some were still
nominally attached to the research centers at Lewis or Langley.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>The rapid growth of STG, fully endorsed by Washington, was only one of the
problems facing its management in the spring of 1959. Perhaps the most difficult
lesson to learn in the first year of Project Mercury was the psychological
reorientation required to meet new economic realities. Aeronautical research
engineers who became administrators under NACA were still essentially group
leaders of [150] research teams. But when NACA became NASA and embarked on
several large-scale development programs, those in development, and in STG in
particular, became not primarily sellers of services but rather buyers of both
services and products. To manage a development program required talents
different from those required to manage a research program, if only because
Government procurement policies and procedures are so complex as to necessitate
corps of experts in supply and logistics. Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri,
one of the knowledgeable observers watching the transition at this time,
remarked, "The big difference between NACA and NASA is that NASA is a
contracting agency."<A
href="notes.htm#n6.44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>

<H3>Costs and Cancellations</H3>Trying to estimate what it should cost to
develop hardware from their designs for a manned satellite, STG at first
envisioned an expenditure of about $16 million to manufacture the program's
spacecraft. But well before the contractor had been selected, Gilruth received a
revised estimate based on new specifications, allowances for overtime, the fixed
fee plus the estimated construction costs, and comparing capsule cost per pound
with that of the X-15 and Dyna-Soar programs. George F. MacDougall, Jr., the
aeronautical research scientist who signed this revised estimate, advised that
the capsule costs should be raised to $22 million. Neither an economist nor a
cost accountant, he did foresee the possibility "that the current estimated
costs of $22,000,000 may be optimistically low."<A
href="notes.htm#n6.45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
<P>The contract negotiated with McDonnell had compromised between the company's
bid of $17,583,717, which was far from the lowest, and the more liberal STG
estimate, to settle on a price of $18,300,000 for manufacturing 12 capsules. In
view of this compromise upward, NASA officials were unprepared for the sudden
acceleration of costs that the contractor claimed was necessary for spare parts,
ground support, and checkout equipment. Before the ink was dry on the prime
contract, the scope of research and development work was found to have
mushroomed. In March, when McDonnell advised NASA that spares and test equipment
would more than double the total contract costs, Abe Silverstein applied
counterpressure, saying indignantly, "I will not tolerate increases such as
those above in the contract for any reasons - utterly unreasonable to increase
an $18,000,000 contract to $41,000,000 by these devices."<A
href="notes.htm#n6.46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile STG and McDonnell representatives held a meeting at the working
level to consolidate and condense the requirements for spare parts and
equipment. Savings effected here were eventually greatly overridden by costs
arising elsewhere. No one could yet foresee that the basic contract for 12
spacecraft would have an evolutionary history of its own.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
Cost accounting for a development program was recognized as a hazardous
occupation, but just how hazardous and where to look for particular pitfalls
took time to learn.
<P>Whereas cynics might expect that the private-enterprise contractor for the
capsule might have underbid to gain the contract, the civil servants in STG were
[151] more surprised to learn that the public enterprise of furnishing the
Nation's ballistic missile defense systems should also have underestimated costs
by approximately one third. Informed by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division
in January that each Atlas booster would cost $3.3 million instead of $2.5
million, George Low tried for two months to get a satisfactory explanation of
this sudden inflation.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>When in May, however, the STG learned of an increase by $8 million in the
amount the Army Ballistic Missile Agency proposed to charge for the Redstones
and Jupiters, the time had come for a thoroughgoing review of cost effectiveness
and program requirements. Gilruth and Purser learned by investigation that the
Ballistic Missile Agency was billing NASA a "burden" surcharge for the benefit
of laboratory overhead costs at Huntsville. Purser's considered reaction to this
was to threaten cancellation of the Jupiter program. If NASA must pay for
research and development at the Redstone Arsenal, he said, then NASA, and STG in
particular, must be more frugal in the estimation of their needs.
<P>The Jupiter rocket had been selected to boost a full-scale capsule to about
16,000 feet per second, a velocity midway between the capacities of Little Joe
and Redstone (6000 feet per second), and of Atlas (25,000 feet per second). But
rather than insist on this step, Purser argued that the Atlas should be
harnessed to duplicate the mission of the Jupiter flights. Since "the cost now
equals or exceeds the cost of an Atlas for the same mission" and the Jupiter
system would not be a "true duplicate of the Mercury capsule system," Purser
recommended that the two Jupiter shots be canceled.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>
<P>After further consideration and more negotiations, Purser's recommendation
was adopted by NASA Headquarters; the Jupiter series was eliminated from the
Mercury program. In the aftermath of this episode, Glennan made an official
complaint to the Secretary of Defense about the necessity to curtail proposed
launchings to control costs, describing the situation with some chagrin:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Members of the staff who have visited Redstone Arsenal report that
  exceptionally high overhead rates apparently result from the necessity of
  supporting a large technical staff with a limited approved work program. The
  net result to us has been the increased costs of a Jupiter launching to more
  than that of an Atlas, whereas a Redstone launching is about $200,000 less
  than that of an Atlas. The prices being 2.7 and 2.9 million respectively.<A
  href="notes.htm#n6.50"><SUP>50</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>At
the same time Mercury engineers who were looking for an alternative to the
balloon flight program discovered that the altitude wind tunnel, the biggest
physical installation at Lewis Research Center, could be used to simulate
environmental conditions up to 80,000 feet. Therefore the balloon flight test
program, primarily designed to "soak" the capsule at comparable altitudes, was
in effect canceled by May. DeMarquis D. Wyatt and other NASA Headquarters
staffers preparing the budget requests for fiscal year 1960 now had evidence of
STG's cost consciousness. The cancellations of the Jupiter series and the
balloon program greatly simplified the program buildup toward manned space
flight. STG engineers were pleased by the resulting concentration of effort.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>[152] One reason STG shed no tears over cancellation of Jupiter and the
balloon tests was that the Little Joe program was making good progress.
Blueprint work for the Little Joe airframe had begun early in 1959. North
American had assigned A. L. Lawbaugh as project engineer; Langley Research
Center had appointed Carl A. Sandahl as its representative for support of this
test booster program; and William M. Bland, Jr., was managing Little Joe for the
Space Task Group. Throughout the year 1959 these three men were primarily
responsible for Little Joe.
<P>Two significant design changes for Little Joe early in 1959 undoubtedly
delayed the program slightly but contributed greatly to its eventual success.
The first change, decided upon by Gilruth and Faget in January, required a
switch from straight to canted nozzles on all the forward-thrusting rocket
motors. Little Joe had no guidance system, and such a redesign would minimize
any upset from unsymmetrical thrust conditions. The other departure from the
original design was the addition of a so-called "booster destruct system." In
the interest of range safety there should be some provision to terminate by
command the thrust of the main motor units. Therefore Charles H. McFall and
Samuel Sokol of Langley devised a booster blowout system, which North American
and Thiokol Chemical Corporation, the manufacturers of the rocket motor
components, added to the forward end of each rocket combustion chamber.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>By mid-February it was apparent that a development program for rocket
hardware, even of such limited scope and relative simplicity as the Little Joe
booster, demanded a far more sophisticated management organization than either
Langley or the Task Group had envisioned. Although informal arrangements had
sufficed to get the program started, funding allocations, personnel expansion,
and contract monitoring problems began to weigh heavily. Carl Sandahl lamented
in one weekly progress report that the transfer of Caldwell C. Johnson from
Langley to the Space Task Group could "just about break up the Little Joe
Project." Langley's loss was STG's gain in this respect, however, and
cooperation continued to be encouraging. Indeed, in May, Bland reported that the
delivery of the first Little Joe booster airframe could be expected
approximately two weeks earlier than scheduled.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>Parallel to the development of the Little Joe test booster, STG and Langley
engineers continued work on what now was called the Scout, the multistage,
solid-propellant research rocket being designed since the previous year for
sounding, probe, or small satellite missions. Langley had maintained its
responsibility for designing the Scout for the Air Force after NACA became NASA;
and early in 1959, Robert O. Piland and Joseph G. Thibodeaux came to work with
William E. Stoney on the staging principles for the long, slim rocket. Although
the Scout, as a Langley project, was not an integral part of STG's activities in
Project Mercury, the Task Group held open the possibility of using this simple
and relatively inexpensive rocket to launch scale models of the Mercury
configuration and to probe for further critical data on heat transfer and
stability. Thus the [153] Scout's capability could fill research gaps that might
arise in the manned satellite project.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
<P>Since January, when it had become apparent that the Army would not soon
relinquish to NASA its rocket development team at Huntsville, NASA Headquarters
had encouraged the Space Task Group to proceed full speed on personnel
recruitment. The exact status of the organization and authority of STG was left
unspecified, while Headquarters felt its way toward the establishment of the
"space projects center" at Beltsville, just outside Washington. Although NASA
had a "hunting license" as a result of its enabling legislation, STG's managers
could not, without full support from President Eisenhower or Administrator
Glennan, know how far or how hard to push the Space Task Group toward a
permanent semi-autonomous establishment.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
<P>STG's need for acquiring competent people without raiding established NASA
research centers was met in large degree by a fortuitous accident that
dramatized Anglo-European complaints about the "brain drain" of their
scientific-technological manpower to the United States. A group of over 100
Canadian and British aeronautical engineers, who had been employed on a
fighter-plane project for the British A. V. Roe (AVRO) Company near Toronto,
Canada, were out of work. AVRO tried to find new jobs for them when the CF-105
Arrow project was canceled as a result of the Commonwealth's decision that the
Bomarc missile made the Arrow obsolescent. Twenty-five of these engineers, led
by James A. Chamberlin, a Canadian, were recruited by STG and immigrated to work
at NASA's Virginia colony in mid-April. They were assigned jobs as individuals
with the existing teams wherever each could be most useful, and they quickly
proved themselves invaluable additions to making Mercury move.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
<P>At the same time, the chief business administrator of the new NASA center at
Beltsville, Michael J. Vaccaro, was planning to accommodate a complement of 425
people for fiscal year 1960 should Gilruth and his manned satellite team move to
Maryland. On the first day of May 1959 the "space projects center," growing out
of Naval Research Laboratory's Vanguard team, was renamed the Goddard Space
Flight Center, and Gilruth's second hat, as the Center's Assistant Director for
Manned Satellites, was reaffirmed. The Mercury program was specified as one of
the six divisional offices at Goddard.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
<P>While many questions of personnel, network management, and contract
procedures for the capsule were still pending, Glennan made his first visit to
the Space Task Group at Langley on May 18, 1959. He was impressed by the
enormity of Project Mercury, by its working-level complexities, and by the
extraordinarily fine morale in STG. Glennan returned to Washington resolved not
to tamper with the esprit of STG. But he was also determined that NASA as a
whole should not become a "space cadet" organization.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
The Administrator's resolution that NASA must not be overwhelmed by the
complexities of manned space flight led to a Headquarters policy of minimal
interference with the Task Group. During the next year, however, the weight of
pressure from [154] the public press and the scope of intragovernmental
coordination related to Mercury was to strain this policy.

</DIV>

<H3>Supporting Agencies and Industries</H3>One of these complexities had been
pointed up in the course of planning operational procedures for launching. Back
in November 1958 the Air Force Missile Test Center had accepted Melvin N. Gough
as director of NASA tests, but it was May 1959 before the Center made any
allowance for the functioning of NASA's skeleton staff for the manned satellite
program. When Herbert F. York, the Pentagon's Director of Defense Research and
Engineering, testified before Congress early in June, he alluded to the
coordination problem between the Department of Defense and NASA and admitted,
"We haven't worked out exactly how to do that yet." B. Porter Brown, the first
STG man to take up residence at the Cape, told his superior, Charles Mathews,
that the administration of the launch complexes at the Atlantic Missile Range
was as intricate as the technical equipment there.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
<P>On May 1, 1959, when NASA set up its own liaison office at Canaveral, Brown
and the STG were still trying to understand all the interrelationships [155]
existing between the Air Force (whose proprietorship stemmed from the
establishment in 1950 of the Long Range Proving Ground), the Navy, and the Army.
The Air Force Missile Test Center (AFMTC) was the steward operating the Atlantic
Missile Range (AMR) for the Department of Defense. The Army had established its
subsidiary Missile Firing Laboratory on the Cape as an integral part of its
Ballistic Missile Agency. By the end of January 1959, Kurt H. Debus, director of
the firing lab, had appointed a project engineer and coordinator for the
Mercury-Redstone program, but the conversion of launch pads Nos. 5 and 6 into
"Launch Complex No. 56" to meet the requirements for Mercury-Redstone launchings
was less imperative than the need to prepare for the Fourth of July launch of
Mercury's Big Joe by an Air Force Atlas.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.60"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
<P>The palmetto-covered dunes at Canaveral had several dozen different kinds of
launch pads, but they were still in short supply and under heavy demands. There
were almost as many different military service and civilian contract
organizations vying for them as there were pads. Proprietary interests were
strongly vested, security restrictions were rigorous, and the newly constituted
space agency was not yet accepted in the elite flight operations society there.
Hangar S, in the industrial area of the Cape, had been tentatively assigned as
"NASA space," but the former Naval Research Laboratory team that had built
Hangar S and was still active with the Vanguard project was there first.
Although now incorporated with NASA, the Vanguard team hoped to carry on with a
new booster development program named Vega. Another group of half-NASA
developers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working with von Braun's people, were
likewise seeking more room to convert Juno I (Jupiter-C) into Juno II (Jupiter
IRBM) launch facilities for more Explorer satellite missions.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
<P>With space for space (as opposed to defense) activities at such a premium,
Porter Brown and his two advance-guard colleagues for STG at the Cape, Philip R.
Maloney and Elmer H. Buller, pressed for a higher priority in Hangar S. But room
was still scarce in early June when Scott H. Simpkinson with about 35 of his
test operations engineers from Lewis Research Center arrived to set up a
preflight checkout laboratory for Big Joe. They found a corner fourth of Hangar
S roped off for their use, and instructions not to overstep these bounds.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
<P>Another problem arose over the scheduled allocation of launch pad No. 14,
which was one of only five available for Atlas launchings. Pad 14 was scheduled
to be used for the Air Force MIDAS (Missile Defense Alarm Satellite) launchings
throughout the same time period that the Mercury qualification flights were
expected to be ready. Although admitting that firing schedules for both the
Mercury-Redstone and the Mercury-Atlas programs were tentative, STG argued that
the same pad assigned for the Big Joe shot should be continuously available for
preparing all subsequent Mercury-Atlas launches.
<P>The commander of the Air Force Missile Test Center disagreed. In the cause of
maximum utilization of Cape facilities, Major General Donald N. Yates ordered
switching of Mercury launches to various available launch stands. These initial
[156] conflicts of interests reached an impasse on June 24, when representatives
of NASA and the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense
met to decide whose shots to postpone. NASA was unable to obtain a concession:
the urgency of ICBM and MIDAS development took precedence.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
<P>The complexity of organizational problems at the Cape might have led space
agency leaders to despair but for an auspicious space flight on May 28. On that
date in 1959 an Army Jupiter intermediate range ballistic missile launched a
nose cone carrying two primate passengers - Able, an American-born rhesus
monkey, and Baker, a South American squirrel monkey - to a 300-mile altitude. At
the end of 15 minutes and a 1500-mile trajectory, along which the cone reached a
speed of about 10,000 miles an hour, the Navy recovered Able and Baker alive and
healthy. The medical experiments were conducted by the Army Medical Service and
the Army Ballistic Missile Agency with the cooperation of the Navy and Air Force
Schools of Aviation Medicine. Not only was the flight a triumph for space
medicine; it also demonstrated an organizational symbiosis of significant
proportions for all of the services and branches involved.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>
<P>But the "interface" problems within NASA, and between NASA and other
agencies, continued to exist, particularly at lower echelons in the planning of
operational procedures for flight control. Mathews and his staff in the Flight
Operations Division of STG were required to plan and replan mission profiles,
schedules, countdown procedures, and mission directives while accommodating the
procedures of other divisions and organizations contributing to the operation.
By mid-spring these working relationships had become so involved that flight
schedules had to undergo radical revision. It gradually became clear that the
original schedules aimed at achieving a manned orbital flight early in April
1960 could not possibly be met.
<P>On top of that, the production of spacecraft hardware and flight equipment
began falling behind schedule. Only one month after the Mockup Review, it became
evident that capsule and systems production slippages were going to become
endemic. On April 17, 1959, Gilruth, speaking before the World Congress of
Flight meeting at Las Vegas, announced casually, "The first manned orbital
flight will not take place within the next two years." The first successful pad
abort using the tower-rocket escape system had just been completed on April 12 -
two years to the day before Gagarin's orbital flight - but Gilruth cautiously
refrained from pronouncing even the escape sequence firm. And he alluded to
other areas of uncertainty:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although the Mercury concept is the simplest possible approach to
  manned flight in space, involving a minimum of new developments, as you can
  see, a great deal of research and development remains to be done. For flight
  within the atmosphere, the capsule must be stable over the widest speed range
  yet encountered by any vehicle - from satellite velocity to a very low impact
  speed. And in orbital flight, all of the systems must function properly in a
  weightless state. It must be compatible with the launch rocket and must be at
  home on the sea while awaiting recovery.<A
  href="notes.htm#n6.65"><SUP>65</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>[157]
In May 1959 the Mercury managers drew up a new functional organization chart
dividing the supervisory activities of STG into five categories: capsules,
boosters and launch, "R and D" support, range, and recovery operations. The
design period for each of these areas having now evolved into developmental
work, each area could more plainly be seen in terms of the contracts to be
monitored by STG personnel. Capsules were divided into three categories, the
first of which was the boilerplate models being built by Langley for the Little
Joe program. For Big Joe, alias the Atlas ablation test, another boilerplate
capsule was under construction jointly, with the STG at Langley responsible for
the upper section and the STG at Lewis for the lower pressure-vessel section of
the capsule. This meant that Langley in conjunction with Radioplane would
perfect the recovery gear and parachute canister, while Lewis people would
handle the automatic control system, the heatshield, sensors, and telemetry.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.66"><SUP>66</SUP></A>
<P>For the production model capsule under McDonnell's aegis, a number of major
subcontractors had long since been selected. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator
Company was developing the automatic stabilization and control system; the
reaction control system was being built by Bell Aerospace Corporation; some
electronics and most radio gear were to be provided by Collins Radio Company;
and the environmental control system, the periscope, and the horizon scanner
were to be supplied by AiResearch, Perkin-Elmer Company, and Barnes Instrument
Company, respectively. The alternative heatshields, as previously noted, were
being provided by several different subcontractors; and the solid rockets for
escape by Grand Central Rocket Company and for the retrothrust package by
Thiokol Chemical Corporation.
<P>With regard to boosters and launching, STG could rely on the extensive
experience of the Ballistic Missile Division/Space Technology Laboratory/Convair
complex for the Atlas, and on the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and the von
Braun/Debus team for the Redstones. Only the Little Joe shots from Wallops
Island would require extensive attention to launch problems because only Little
Joe was exclusively a NASA booster. North American, the prime contractor, would
provide whatever Langley could not for Little Joe.
<P>Under the miscellaneous category "R and D support," however, Project Mercury
would not only require the help of all the other NASA research centers -
Langley, Ames, Lewis, and now Goddard - but also of the NASA stations for
high-speed flight research at Edwards, California, and for pilotless aircraft
research at Wallops Island, Virginia. At least 10 separate commands under the
Air Force would be closely involved, and various facilities of the Navy Bureau
of Aeronautics, especially the human centrifuge at Johnsville, Pennsylvania,
would likewise be extensively used.

<P class="caption">The two major systems of Mercury flight hardware were of

Dynamics/Astronautics plant in San Diego (above) and the Mercury spacecraft,

<P>The range and tracking network requirements being supervised by the alter ego
to STG, namely the Tracking Unit (TAGIU) or the Mercury network group at
Langley, gradually became clear as contractors began to report on their
feasibility and programming studies. The Lincoln Laboratory of the Massachusetts
[159] Institute of Technology, the Aeronutronics Division of the Ford Motor
Company, Space Electronics Corporation, and the RCA Service Company held four
study contracts to help Soul&eacute; decide on ground equipment, radar coverage,
control center arrangements, and the exact specifications for various contracts.
Although a preliminary bidders' briefing on the tracking, telemetry, and
telecommunications plans for Project Mercury took place at Langley on April 1,
the basic design document, "Specifications for Tracking and Ground
Instrumentation System for Project Mercury," did not appear until May 21.
Consequently NASA did not select the prime contractor for the tracking network
until midsummer.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.67"><SUP>67</SUP></A>
<P>Finally, regarding recovery operations, a NASA and Department of Defense
working group decided on May 11 to make use of the investment already made by
Grumman Aircraft Corporation in operations research for its spacecraft bid
proposal on recovery requirements. Concurrently arrangements were being made
with the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commander in Chief of the Atlantic
Fleet, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, the Strategic Air Command, the
Atlantic Missile Range, the Marines, and the Coast Guard for the specific help
each could render when the time should come for search and retrieval.
<P>Although these relations appeared to have grown exceedingly complex, they had
only just begun to multiply. Gilruth, however, was confident that by careful
coordination and through the largely personal and informal working methods of
STG, he and his men could handle the problems arising in the Mercury development
program. As an encouraging example, the booster and launch coordination panels,
established separately for the Atlas and the Redstone, had by mid-May already
achieved impressive understandings on what had to be done. In the case of the
Atlas, the coordination panel worked out the division of labor between NASA,
McDonnell, the Ballistic Missile Division, Convair, and STG. Panel members
simply discussed until they had resolved such key problems on their agenda as
general launch operations procedures, trajectories and flight plans for the
first two scheduled launches, general approach to an abort sensing system and
procedures, range and pad safety procedures, general mechanical and electrical
mating, blockhouse space requirements, general countdown and checkout
procedures, and velocity cutoff in the event of overshooting the orbit insertion
point. Six Redstone booster and launch panels, established at an important
coordination meeting on February 11 with STG and McDonnell at Redstone Arsenal,
likewise resolved in monthly meetings many such items.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.68"><SUP>68</SUP></A>
For both boosters, many details remained outstanding, of course, but the fact
that pending problems were being identified early and systematically in May 1959
gave the STG confidence that no further schedule slippages could be charged to
the lack of intelligent planning.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.69"><SUP>69</SUP></A>

<H3>Astronaut Selection</H3>Now that the men had been chosen to serve as the
focal points for all this effort, new spirits animated the Space Task Group.
Indeed, the Nation as a whole [160] began to participate vicariously in Project
Mercury when, on April 9, 1959, at a press conference in Washington, Glennan
introduced to the public the seven men chosen to be this Nation's nominees for
the first human voyagers into space.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.70"><SUP>70</SUP></A>
<P>They were to be called "astronauts," as the pioneers of ballooning had been
called "aeronauts," and the legendary Greeks in search of the Golden Fleece were
called "Argonauts," for they were to sail into a new, uncharted ocean. These
personable pilots were introduced in civilian dress; many people in their
audience forgot that they were volunteer test subjects and military officers.
Their public comments did not class them with any elite intelligentsia. Rather
they were a contingent of mature Americans, average in build and visage, family
men all, college-educated as engineers, possessing excellent health, and
professionally committed to flying advanced aircraft.
<P>Compared with the average, white, middle-class American male, they enjoyed
better health, both physically and psychologically, and they had far more
experience among and above the clouds. Slightly short of average in stature,
they were above average in seriousness of purpose. Otherwise these seven seemed
almost random samples of average American manhood. Yet the names of Carpenter,
Cooper, Glenn, Grissom, Schirra, Shepard, and Slayton were perhaps to become as
familiar in American history as those of any actor, soldier, or athlete.
<P>Despite the wishes of NASA Headquarters, and particularly of Dryden,
Silverstein, and Gilruth, the fame of the astronauts quickly grew beyond all
proportion to their current activities and their preflight mission assignments.
Perhaps it was inevitable that the "crew-pool" members of STG were destined for
premature adulation, what with the enormous public curiosity about them, the
risk they would take in space flight, and their exotic training activities. But
the power of commercial competition for publicity and the pressure for political
prestige in the space race also whetted an insatiable public appetite for this
new kind of celebrity. Walter T. Bonney, long a public information officer for
NACA and now Glennan's adviser on these matters, foresaw the public and press
attention, asked for an enlarged staff, and laid the guidelines for public
affairs policy in close accord with that of other Government agencies.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.71"><SUP>71</SUP></A>
<P>The astronauts were first and foremost test pilots, men accustomed to flying
alone in the newest, most advanced, and most powerful vehicles this civilization
had produced. They were talented specialists who loved to fly high-performance
aircraft and who had survived the natural selection process in their profession.
The demand for excellence in piloting skills, in physical health, and
psychological adaptability becomes ever more stringent as one ascends the ladder
toward the elite among military aviators, those senior test pilots with upwards
of 1500 hours' total flying time.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.72"><SUP>72</SUP></A>
<P>Eisenhower's decision that the military services could provide the pilots
greatly simplified the astronaut selection procedure. From a total of 508
service records screened in January 1959 by Stanley C. White, Robert B. Voas,
and William S. Augerson at the military personnel bureaus in Washington, 110 men
were found to [161] meet the minimum standards specified earlier. This list of
names included five Marines, 47 Navy men, and 58 Air Force pilots. Several Army
pilots' records had been screened earlier, but none was a graduate of a test
pilot school. The selection process began while the possibility of manned
Redstone flights late in 1959 still existed on paper.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.73"><SUP>73</SUP></A>
<P>The evaluation committee at Headquarters, headed by the Assistant Director of
STG, Charles J. Donlan, decided to divide the list of 110 arbitrarily into three
groups and to issue invitations for the first group of 35 to come to Washington
at the beginning of February for briefings and interviews. Donlan was pleased to
learn from his staff, White, Voas, and Augerson, that 24 of the first group
interviewed were happy with the prospects of participating in the Mercury
program. Every one of the first 10 men interrogated on February 2 agreed to
continue through the elimination process. The next week another group of
possible pilot-candidates arrived in Washington. The high rate of volunteering
made it unnecessary to extend the invitations to the third group. Justifying
this action, George Low reported:
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the briefings and interviews it became apparent that the
  final number of pilots should be smaller than the twelve originally planned
  for. The high rate of interest in the project indicates that few, if any, of
  the men will drop out during the training program. It would, therefore, not be
  fair to the men to carry along some who would not be able to participate in
  the flight program. Consequently, a recommendation has been made to name only
  six finalists.<A
  href="notes.htm#n6.74"><SUP>74</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Sixty-nine
men had reported to Washington in two groups by the middle of February. Of
these, six were found to have grown too tall. Fifty-six test pilots took the
initial battery of written tests, technical interviews, psychiatric interviews,
and medical history reviews. Those who declined or were eliminated reduced the
total at the beginning of March to 36 men. They were invited to undergo the
extraordinary physical examinations planned for them at the Lovelace Clinic in
Albuquerque. Thirty-two accepted and became candidates, knowing also that they
were scheduled to pass through extreme mental and physical environmental tests
at the Wright Air Development Center, in Dayton, Ohio, after being certified as
physically qualified by the Lovelace Clinic. The 32 candidates were assured that
the data derived from these special examinations in New Mexico and Ohio would
not jeopardize their military careers, since none of the findings was to go into
their service records.
<P>Although the psychophysiological criteria for the selection of the best
possible pilots for manned space flight had been under discussion for several
years, the actual arrangement of the selection procedures for Mercury was
directed by a NASA selection committee consisting of a senior management
engineer, Donlan; a test pilot engineer, North; two flight surgeons, White and
Augerson; two psychologists, Allen O. Gamble and Voas; and two psychiatrists,
George E. Ruff and Edwin Z. Levy. These seven men had done the screening of
records and the interviews and testing in Washington, constituting phases one
and two of the [162] selection program, before remanding their pool of 32
candidates to the medical examiners at the Lovelace Foundation.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.75"><SUP>75</SUP></A>
<P>Individually each candidate arrived at Albuquerque to undergo approximately a
week of medical evaluations under each of five different schedules. In this
third phase of the program, over 30 different laboratory tests collected
chemical, encephalographic, and cardiographic data. X-ray examinations
thoroughly mapped each man's body. The ophthalmology section and the
otolaryngology sections likewise learned almost everything about each
candidate's eyes, and his ears, nose, and throat. Special physiological
examinations included bicycle ergometer tests, a total-body radiation count,
total-body water determination, and the specific gravity of the whole body.
Heart specialists made complete cardiological examinations, and other clinicians
worked out more complete medical histories on these men than probably had ever
before been attempted on human beings. Nevertheless the selectees were so
healthy that only one of the 32 was found to have a medical problem potentially
serious enough to eliminate him from the subsequent tests at the Wright
Aeromedical Laboratory.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.76"><SUP>76</SUP></A>
<P>Phase four of the selection program was an amazingly elaborate set of
environmental studies, physical endurance tests, anthropometric measurements,
and psychiatric studies conducted at the Aeromedical Laboratory of the Wright
Air Development Center. During March each of the 31 subjects spent another week
experiencing a wide range of stressful conditions. Voas explained phases three
and four: "While the purpose of the medical examinations at Lovelace Clinic had
been to determine the general health status of the candidates, the purpose of
the testing program at Wright Field was to determine the physical and
psychological capability of the individual to respond effectively and
appropriately to the various types of stresses associated with space
missions."<A
href="notes.htm#n6.77"><SUP>77</SUP></A>
In addition to pressure suit tests, acceleration tests, vibration tests, heat
tests, and loud noise tests, each candidate had to prove his physical endurance
on treadmills, tilt tables, with his feet in ice water, and by blowing up
balloons until exhausted. Continuous psychiatric interviews, the necessity of
living with two psychologists throughout the week, an extensive self-examination
through a battery of 13 psychological tests for personality and motivation, and
another dozen different tests on intellectual functions and special aptitudes -
these were all part of the week of truth at Dayton.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.78"><SUP>78</SUP></A>
<P>Two of the more interesting personality and motivation studies seemed like
parlor games at first, until it became evident how profound an exercise in
Socratic introspection was implied by conscientious answers to the test
questions "Who am I?" and "Whom would you assign to the mission if you could not
go yourself?" In the first case, by requiring the subject to write down 20
definitional identifications of himself, ranked in order of significance, and
interpreted projectively, the psychologists elicited information on identity and
perception of social roles. In the peer ratings, each candidate was asked which
of the other members of the group of five accompanying him through this phase of
the program he liked best, [163] which one he would like to accompany him on a
two-man mission, and whom he would substitute for himself. Candidates who had
proceeded this far in the selection process all agreed with one who complained,
"Nothing is sacred any more."<A
href="notes.htm#n6.79"><SUP>79</SUP></A>
<P>Back at STG headquarters at Langley, late in March 1959, phase five began.
The final evaluation of data was made by correlating clinical and statistical
information from New Mexico and Ohio. Eighteen of the 31 candidates came
recommended without medical reservations for final consideration by Donlan and
North. According to Donlan, although the physicians, psychiatrists,
psychologists, and physiologists had done their best to establish gradations,
the attrition rate was too low. So the final criteria for selecting the
candidates reverted to the technical qualifications of the men and the technical
requirements of the program, as judged by Donlan, North, White, and finally
Gilruth. "We looked for real men and valuable experience," said Donlan. The
selection tests, as it turned out, were largely tests of tests, "conducted as
much for the research value in trying to formulate the characteristics of
astronauts as for determining any deficiencies of the group being examined." The
verbal responses at the interviews, before and after the psychophysiological
testing, therefore, seem to have been as important final determinants as the
candidates' test scores.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.80"><SUP>80</SUP></A>
<P>Sitting in judgment over 18 finalists, Donlan, White, and North pared down
the final pool of selectees, choosing each to complement the rest of the group.
The going was so difficult that they could not reach the magic number six, so
Gilruth decided to recommend seven. Donlan then telephoned each of the seven
individually to ask whether he was still willing to accept a position as a
Mercury astronaut. Each one gladly volunteered again. The 24 who were passed
over were notified and asked to reapply for reconsideration in some future
program. Gilruth's endorsement of the final list was passed upward to
Silverstein and Glennan for final review, and by mid-April the faces of
America's original seven spacemen were shown to the world.
<P>As the astronauts lost their private lives, Project Mercury found its first
great public notice. An eighth military officer and pilot came aboard STG about
the same time to manage the public information and press relations that were
already threatening to intrude on the time and talent of STG. The eighth
personality was an experienced Air Force pilot who had flown extensively in
World War II, on the Berlin Airlift, and in Korea, and who also had proven
himself as a public information officer after 1954, when he was charged with
ameliorating public fears and complaints over jet noises, sonic booms, and the
ballistic missile programs.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.81"><SUP>81</SUP></A>
Lieutenant Colonel John A. Powers, USAF, came on board the STG staff in early
April 1959. Thereafter the mellifluous voice and impish grin of "Shorty" Powers
made his reputation as the primary buffer for STG in its relations with the
press and the public. Throughout the Mercury program, he stood before the news
media and the people of the world as the one living symbol of all the anonymous
human effort behind the astronaut of the moment.
<P>Powers propagated some oversimplified images in many instances, as it was
[164] his job to do, but no one man then or now could completely understand or
communicate the complexity of the myriad research, development, and operations
activities that lay behind a launch. Then, too, the caliber of the questions
determined the quality of his answers, and all too often the questions asked
were simple. What was an astronaut really like? What did he eat for breakfast?
Which ones had been Boy Scouts? How did their wives take their commitment? Such
questions provoked many to abandon asking how these seven came to be chosen and
for what purpose they were entering training.
<P>From the United States Marine Corps, Lieutenant Colonel John Herschel Glenn,
Jr., received orders to report to the Space Task Group at Langley Field, on the
first of May. He then found himself the senior astropilot in age and date of
rank. From the Navy, Walter Marty Schirra, Jr., and Alan Bartlett Shepard, Jr.,
both lieutenant commanders, and Lieutenant Malcolm Scott Carpenter reported
aboard STG. And the Air Force assigned three captains, Donald Kent Slayton,
Leroy Gordon Cooper, Jr., and Virgil I. Grissom, to duty with NASA as test
pilots, alias Mercury astronauts.
<P>On May 28, 1959, the astronauts were brought before the House Committee on
Science and Astronautics in executive session. They were asked to reassure the
Congressmen that they were content with the orderliness, safety, and seriousness
of Project Mercury. This they did vigorously, together and separately, before
Schirra mentioned the "seven-sided coin" of competition over which one should
get the first flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n6.82"><SUP>82</SUP></A>
<P>The first seven American astronauts were an admirable group of individuals
chosen to sit at the apex of a pyramid of human effort. In training to transcend
[165] gravity they became a team of personalities as well as a crew of pilots.
They were lionized by laymen and adored by youth as heroes before their courage
was truly tested. In volunteering to entrust their lives to Mercury's spirit and
Atlas' strength to blaze a trail for man into the empyrean, they chose to lead
by following the opportunity that chance, circumstance, technology, and history
had prepared for them. Influential 20th-century philosophers as diverse as
Bertrand Russell, Teilhard de Chardin, and Walter Kaufmann tell us that man's
profoundest aspiration is to know himself and his universe and that life's
deepest passion is a desire to become godlike. All men must balance their hubris
with their humility, but, as one of those aspiring astronauts said, "How could
anyone turn down a chance to be a part of something like this?"<A
href="notes.htm#n6.83"><SUP>83</SUP></A>
<P>Shortly after the astronauts were introduced to the public, a literate layman
asked directions of Mercury for mankind in general:
