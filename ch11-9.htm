<H1>Titov Widens the Gap</H1>Despite the loss of <I>Liberty Bell 7</I>, the 
Mercury-Redstone phase of the program had been so successful that there was 
little reason for keeping it alive. The termination of the manned suborbital 
flights had seemed predictable after Gagarin and certain after Shepard. A month 
and a half before Grissom flew, the Space Task Group had decided to cancel the 
fourth such flight, MR-6. Silverstein and Gilruth also had considered canceling 
the third flight, MR-5, to concentrate on Mercury-Atlas operations. But 
Silverstein believed that data obtained from Grissom's MR-4 should be appraised 
before deciding whether to bypass the MR-5.
<P>Besides, at that time the subject was politically sensitive. Since three 
astronauts were training for the Mercury-Redstone missions, the public 
expectation, expressed in Congress and through the press, was that there would 
be at least three manned Redstone flights. But if Mercury-Atlas could be 
expedited, an astronaut making three orbits would eclipse the cosmonaut who had 
made one orbit.
<P>On August 7, 1961, all such hopes were erased by the day-long, 17- orbit 
flight and successful recovery of Cosmonaut Gherman S. Titov. When the U.S.S.R. 
announced its spectacular second space flight, some Americans were filled with 
awe, some with admiration, and some even with fear, while a few expressed only 
scornful disbelief. At 9 a.m., Moscow time, on August 6, 1961, the Soviet pilot 
rocketed into orbit aboard <I>Vostok II</I>. The space voyage of this 
26-year-old Russian covered 17.5 orbits and took 25 hours and 18 minutes.<A

<P>After the data gathered from the Grissom flight had been evaluated, NASA and 
Space Task Group managers decided that little could be gained from any further 
Mercury-Redstone missions. On August 14, Paul Purser drafted a termination 
recommendation for Gilruth's submittal to Silverstein. Purser pointed out that 
the Redstone had done well its job of qualifying the spacecraft, astronauts, and 
most other critical aspects of the operation. Mercury-Redstone also had 
validated the various training devices, and it had uncovered many technical 
problems, none of which appeared to be insoluble before an American orbital 
flight.<A

Now it was time to turn to the principal Mercury-Atlas problem areas, such as 
explosive hatch, inverter heating, oxygen usage rate, control system linkage, 
and egress training, and to cope with the more complex Atlas program. [378] Four 
days later, on August 18, NASA Headquarters publicly announced that the 
objectives of the Mercury- Redstone program had been achieved, and that 
accordingly it was canceled. Six days later, Joachim P. Kuettner, 
Mercury-Redstone Project Chief at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, 
told his subordinates that the Redstone must now be retired after helping gain a 
toe hold on space.<A

<P>Several accounts of the Soviet manned space feats indicated striking 
similarities in cosmonaut and astronaut selection and training. The Russians 
were chosen by a strenuous selection program, which was much like the American 
procedure, but their selection emphasized youth and stamina, rather than flight 
experience and engineering. Soviet training, like American, employed the human 
centrifuge, altitude chamber, isolation,technical systems study, and personal 
physical training. Also, three pilots trained in competition for the first 
flight, Titov being Gagarin's backup pilot on <I>Vostok I</I> of April 12. 
Gagarin's and Titov's accounts of liftoff and orbital flight described the same 
phenomena - g-load buildup, vibrations, and impressions of weightlessness.
<P>Titov was reported to have exercised manual control. This transliteration was 
taken in some circles to mean that he changed his orbital plane, but the Mercury 
experts believed that Titov's manual control was for attitude only, like that 
exercised by Shepard and Grissom. Titov reported sleeping seven hours or more, 
and some translations indicated that he was awakened by his weightless arms 
floating. This last claim was too much for David Lawrence, a syndicated 
columnist, who suggested that the flight might have been a hoax. But the members 
of the Space Task Group never doubted the authenticity of either <I>Vostok I</I> 
or <I>Vostok II</I>. Too much was similar. Although only two or three people in 
the Space Task Group could read Russian, the reports translated from Soviet 
journals seemed to correspond to their own experience.
<P>One of Titov's publicized problems caused concern among NASA and Space Task 
Group medical specialists. Before entering his rest period, Titov complained of 
feelings "akin to seasickness" and became nauseated. He had to be careful not to 
move his head too swiftly in any direction. After sleep, his nausea apparently 
abated; it finally disappeared completely when Titov began to feel reentry 
pressures. NASA aeromedical advisers suggested that the first American in 
orbital flight ought to guard against, watch for, and test out this peculiar 
physiological reaction reported by Titov and the Soviets.<A

<P>Psychologically, the Russian Vostok feats created some uneasiness in the 
United States. Many people admired the Soviet's technological proficiency but 
were concerned by the strategic implications. The fact that Titov's orbital 
track in a near-polar plane carried him over the United States three times was 
alarming to some people. In spite of the fact that the decision for the 
accelerated space program was confirmed, the term "space lag" began appearing 
more frequently in the press and in the statements of some Congressmen. 
Criticism of NASA, the departed Eisenhower administration, and even the Kennedy 
administration mounted. After the Gagarin flight, for example, Democratic 
Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri caustically pointed to the years of 
indecision that had so long delayed the Saturn launch vehicle. After the Titov 
flight, John W. Finney, aerospace and science writer for the <I>New York 
Times</I>, pictured Washington officialdom as carping over NASA's "easy pace" in 
implementing the lunar landing program outlined by President Kennedy. No 
specifications for a lunar spacecraft yet were evident; no agreement on the 
route to take or on the necessary launch vehicle had been reached. But these 
were mostly NASA Headquarters worries; the primary task of the Space Task Group 
still lay ahead. Regardless of the fact that Mercury could now only duplicate 
the feats of the Vostoks, Project Apollo, the manned lunar-landing project, 
depended upon Mercury Mark II (later named Gemini), the two-man rendezvous and 
docking project; and Gemini depended upon the fulfillment of Mercury; in turn, 
that depended upon the strength and stability of Atlas. The day Titov came back 
to Earth, NASA's Space Task Group announced candidly, if not calmly, that the 
first try at putting an American in orbit might slip unavoidably into January 
1962.<A
