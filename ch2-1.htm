<H1>Exploring the Human Factor</H1>
<H2>(1948 - 1958)</H2>[33] THE development of the large liquid-fueled rocket 
made the dazzling prospect of manned flight beyond Earth's atmosphere and into 
the vacuum of space increasingly feasible from the standpoint of propulsion. By 
1950, however, only instrumented sounding rockets, fired to ever higher 
altitudes in both the United States and the Soviet Union, had reached into space 
before falling earthward. Although a number of these experimental shots carried 
living organisms - everything from fungus spores to monkeys in the United 
States, mainly dogs in the U.S.S.R. - the data acquired from telemetry and from 
occasional recovery of rocket nose cones had not shown conclusively how long 
organisms could live in space, or indeed whether man could survive at all 
outside the protective confines of his atmosphere. Scientists still were 
hesitant to predict how a human being would behave under conditions to be 
encountered in space flight. Thus while space flight became technologically 
practicable, physiologically and psychologically it remained an enigma.
<P>In the early 1950s an acceleration of efforts in upper-atmospheric and space 
medical research accompanied the quickened pace of rocket development in this 
country and in the Soviet Union. During the next few years medical specialists, 
profiting from substantial progress in telemetering clinical data, learned a 
great deal about what a man could expect when he went into the forbidding arena 
of space.<A

Much of the confidence with which the engineers of Project Mercury in 1958 
approached the job of putting a man into orbit and recovering him stemmed from 
the findings of hundreds of studies made in previous years on the human factors 
in space flight.
<P>Since the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was interested almost 
exclusively in the technology of flight, research in the medical problems of 
space flight, like aviation medicine in previous decades, was the province 
primarily of the military services and of some civilian research organizations 
receiving funds from the military. Of the three services, the United States Air 
Force, rich in background in aeromedical research and assuming that space 
medicine was but [34] an extension of aviation medicine, undertook most of the 
early inquiry into the psychophysiological problems of extra-atmospheric flight.
