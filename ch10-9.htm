<H1>"News will be Worse Before it is Better:" MA-3 and LJ-5B</H1>Although 
Project Mercury was not stampeded by the flight of <I>Vostok I</I>, Congress 
nearly was. As Mercury approached its goal, its ends became merely a means to 
the Moon. While the funding for Project Apollo was being discussed in Congress, 
the Gagarin flight provided a tremendous impetus to the desires of Americans, as 
mirrored in the lower house of their national legislature, to become first once 
again. In the chagrin of the moment, some Congressmen appeared willing to 
appropriate more money than NASA could spend. Robert Seamans, third in command 
of NASA as Associate Administrator and general manager, actually had difficulty 
restraining the House space committee's demands for an all-out crash program for 
a lunar landing. President Kennedy, consistent with one of his campaign 
promises, reacted to the Gagarin announcement by saying, "We are behind . . . 
the news will be worse before it is better, and it will be some time before we 
catch up."<A

<P>The President knew not how well he had prophesied the major Mercury events of 
the next two weeks. The time was up for Mercury to be first in space, but the 
qualification flight tests were still far from over. Mercury-Atlas 3, composed 
of "thick-skinned" Atlas 100-D and capsule No. 8, was, on April 10, 1961, 
standing on the pad at the Cape being groomed for a long ballistic flight over 
Bermuda and the Atlantic Ocean. A primary purpose of MA-3 was to test the dual 
abilities of the Cape and Bermuda to handle an abort about the time of orbital 
insertion. Walter Williams had already satisfied himself that this was no 
problem and that the MA-3 mission should be more ambitious. After Gagarin's 
flight the Mercury senior staff on April 14 decided it was technically feasible 
to change the MA-3 mission objectives to a full-scale one-orbit goal. When 
Warren North informed Silverstein of this change on April 17, he also noted that 
MA-4 should be a chimp-carrying orbital flight about mid-July.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-9.htm#source91"><SUP>91</A></SUP> 
However, Low, [337] acting for Silverstein, in direct consultation with Seamans, 
Gilruth, Williams, and others after Gagarin's flight, had already approved the 
speedup in the mission objectives for MA-3.
<P>Carrying a "crewman simulator," an electronic mannequin that could "inhale" 
and "exhale" manlike quantities of gas, heat, and water vapor, MA-3 should test 
not only the capsule systems but also the reliability of this standard 
Mercury-Atlas. The critical tracking system and computer arrangement at Goddard, 
the Cape, and Bermuda must prove its ability to predict the "go/no go" decision 
before the danger of impacting in Africa. It was too late to change most of the 
documentation for MA-3, including the information summary and mission directive, 
but revised preflight trajectory data were hastily computed and disseminated. 
Computer programmers James J. Donegan of Goddard and John P. Mayer of STG worked 
their men through the eve of the flight checking the changed flight plan.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-9.htm#source92"><SUP>92</A></SUP>
<P>MA-3 failed tactically, but strategically this orbital flight attempt 
probably did more than anything else in the Mercury program to implement the 
"gold-plating," or the real man-rating of the Atlas. It carried the last of the 
first series of capsules with the dual ports and without a landing impact bag. 
The capsule was to be inserted into orbit at an altitude of 100 miles and a 
slant range of 515 miles from Cape Canaveral. If the velocity of Atlas 100-D was 
not high enough, it could be aborted into any one of several preplanned recovery 
zones between Bermuda and the Canary Islands.
<P>As it happened, the Atlas attempt to orbit a robot, made at 11:15 a.m. on 
April 25, 1961, was intentionally destroyed by the range safety officer only 40 
seconds after launch when the autopilot programmer on the Atlas failed to roll 
and pitch the vehicle over toward the horizon. The mission having aborted, 
however, the entire Mercury escape system worked perfectly and the launch site 
recovery team responded exactly as if there had been a pilot's life at stake. 
The spacecraft was towed to a maximum altitude of 24,000 feet by the escape 
rocket and lowered gently by its main parachute a short distance offshore. The 
capsule came through this relatively easy abort with only minor damages and was 
quickly recovered and refurbished for reuse on MA-4.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-9.htm#source93"><SUP>93</A></SUP> 
Destroyed after its failure to initiate roll and pitch programs, booster 100-D 
left few artifacts as memorials of its existence. Before the official 
investigation board could complete its report two months later, however, a 
significant piece of the MA-3 autopilot, the programmer, was found buried in the 
mud near the beach, thereby leading to the corroboration of one of the prime 
hypotheses for this failure.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-9.htm#source94"><SUP>94</A></SUP>
<P>Meanwhile, back at Wallops Island, the seventh and last booster in the Little 
Joe series was fitted with capsule No. 14 and made ready for a repeat of LJ-5 
and LJ-5A in hopes that the third try would be charmed. This was to be an 
extremely critical test before MR-3. Gilruth, from Low's home in Washington, 
called William Bland at Wallops Island to encourage the launching if weather 
permitted. The preflight documentation was virtually identical to that of the 
previous Little Joe flight, as was the refurbished spacecraft. [338] Still more 
instrumentation and even more careful checkout procedures to ensure that the 
abort would occur at the right time were instituted in addition to the 
redesigned clamp ring and limit switches. A steep trajectory up to about 45,000 
feet was desired before tower separation and drogue chute deployment. The max-q 
punishment of about 990 pounds per square foot was desired to match the worst of 
the Atlas abort conditions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-9.htm#source95"><SUP>95</A></SUP>
<P>When on April 28, 1961, at 9:03 a.m., LJ-5B rammed upward, technical 
observers cringed when they saw immediately that one of the booster's Castor 
rocket motors failed to ignite for 5 seconds after liftoff. This resulted in a 
much lower trajectory than planned, giving a maximum altitude of only 14,600 
feet, but the dynamic pressure, instead of 990 pounds per square foot, was about 
twice that amount, 1920 pounds. The abort was initiated about 33 seconds after 
launch as intended, and all events following the abort occurred as they should 
have. Recovery by helicopter was quick and clean, even though the low-flying 
capsule impacted two miles farther downrange after skidding through the 
atmosphere rather than vaulting through it. Lewis R. Fisher, Leo T. Chauvin, and 
Norman F. Smith of the STG Little Joe team were able therefore to wind up their 
program with a boast despite the erroneous trajectory: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This launching successfully demonstrated the structural integrity 
  of the Mercury capsule and escape system and sequential system under 
  significantly more severe conditions than those expected to be encountered 
  during a nontumbling type of abort from an Atlas booster during a Mercury 
  orbital launch . . . . Changes in circuitry and redesign of clamp-limit-switch 
  installations in Capsule 14 for the Little Joe 5-B mission successfully 
  eliminated the problem of premature ignition of the escape rocket motor.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-9.htm#source96"><SUP>96</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>One 
by one the major obstacles to the growth of the manned space flight enterprise 
seemed to have dissolved. The opposition of some in the scientific community was 
not expected to become a factor in national policy. The so-called 
"military-industrial complex" had failed, if indeed it had ever tried, to reduce 
NASA. The White House and NASA administrators were determined to advance 
national capability in space technology. Political dangers were now neutralized. 
Except for the Atlas and the spacecraft's orbital capacities, all Mercury 
systems were qualified. Despite the embarrassment to American nationalism 
brought by Gagarin's flight, Mercury as a technological accomplishment was on 
the verge of sending a man to visit the edge of the black sea of space. And 
certainly this year of grace 1961 should also see an American citizen orbit the 
globe.<A

April 30, 1961," STG, was the tenth quarterly review of Project Mercury by the 
700 or so members of STG for NASA Headquarters. Of six flights since January, 
only two (MA-3 and LJ-5A) were admitted failures. Of 10 qualification flight 
tests with production McDonnell capsules to date (the 4-inch flight of MR—1 was 
excluded), 6 (including MR—BD) were counted as "successful," although a 
historical accounting should, on the basis of intent, make that record read 5 
out of 10 "unsuccessful" at least. Capsule orbit weight was calculated at 2,836 
pounds and expected to be 2,874 pounds by July, still within Atlas capabilities. 
"Project Orbit," the simulated orbital test program using Capsule No. 10 in 
McDonnell's altitude chamber, was well underway; the tracking network and ground 
instrumentation system was reported 95 percent complete; while ground 
qualifications testing and reliability testing were said to be 95 and 90 percent 
complete, respectively. Readiness for the first manned sub-orbital test flight, 
including the lately renewed studies to "quick-fix" the impact protection, 
landing system, and reaction control system, and to test more animals in 
centrifuges, was asserted to be clear if the flight safety review board meetings 
at the Cape on April 28-29, 1961, should certify both capsule and booster.
