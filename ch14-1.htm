<H1>Chapter 14</H1>
<H1>Climax of Project Mercury</H1>[461] WALTER M. Schirra, a naval aviator who 
had won the Distinguished Flying Cross for his combat missions over Korea, 
received his most important assignment to date on July 27, 1962. It was the 
flight plan for Mercury-Atlas 8, a six-orbit flight that was to qualify the 
spacecraft and man's endurance for an extended spatial mission. A new plan, 
revised slightly for yaw-reference experiments using the periscope, was 
delivered on August 8. This was almost 60 days before the mission, allowing the 
period for training that Scott Carpenter had recommended. Carpenter had received 
his MA-7 document late, and major revisions had been inserted almost until 
launch day. Although Schirra's flight plan was altered in September, it did 
escape a thorough last-minute rewrite.
<P>MA-8 was to be an engineering flight, in contrast with the exploratory nature 
of Glenn's flight in MA-6 and the developmental and scientific nature of MA-7. 
Schirra was expected to concern himself largely with the management and 
operation of the spacecraft's systems to conserve hydrogen peroxide attitude 
control fuel and electrical power. The MSC planners had examined the 
minute-by-minute details from launch to recovery in the interest of spacecraft 
endurance and had programmed only a few experiments that would require fuel or 
electrical power. The pilot was to try to observe a ground xenon light of 
140-million candlepower at Durban, South Africa, and four flares of 1-million 
candlepower each that would be launched near Woomera, Australia. The only other 
experiment requiring astronaut participation included some weather and 
terrestrial photography as the pilot sighted targets of opportunity. Besides 
these experiments, several passive test devices were superimposed on the 
spacecraft's exterior. Eight ablation panels, consisting of several types of 
material, were fused onto the afterbody's beryllium shingles, and a white paint 
patch was brushed on the capsule's side for still more evaluations of spatial 
thermal effects on various materials.<A

<P>Early in August, Schirra trained energetically for a targeted September 
launch; spacecraft No. 16 was almost ready for a simulated flight in Hangar S; 
and Atlas No. 113-D had arrived at the Cape. Then on August 11, the Soviet 
Union, [462] without prior announcement, launched <I>Vostok III</I>. NASA 
leaders, who had endured much needling on the space gap since Gherman S. Titov's 
17-orbit flight, a little more than a year earlier, grimly read the press 
reports. The five-ton Vostok spacecraft, with Major Andrian G. Nikolayev aboard, 
was in an orbit with a 156-mile apogee and a 113-mile perigee, inclined (as 
usual for Vostoks) at 65 degrees.
<P>The "gap" seemed to become a "gulf" the following day, when <I>Vostok IV</I>, 
carrying Lieutenant Colonel Pavel R. Popovich, shot into an orbit with an apogee 
of 157 miles and a perigee of 112 miles. Soon after the second launch, Nikolayev 
reported that he had sighted Popovich's spacecraft. Western tracking stations 
variously reported that the two craft were as close as 3 and as far as 300 miles 
apart. Intercepted communications between Nikolayev (code-named Falcon) and 
Popovich (Golden Eagle) caused serious speculation that the Vostoks might try to 
rendezvous, but apparently no such attempt was made.
<P>On August 15, Nikolayev landed after 64 orbits and more than 95 hours in 
space. Popovich touched down six minutes later, after 48 orbits and more than 70 
hours' flight.<A

The U.S. decision to accelerate the space program called for by President 
Kennedy in May 1961 seemed more than validated to most critical observers. 
Meanwhile engineers who were designing what became the Gemini vehicle for 
rendezvous with an orbiting Agena rocket studied the possibility of adding a 
space-maneuvering capability to Mercury. On August 24, Kenneth S. Kleinknecht, 
the Project Office chief, reported that such an innovation would require at 
least 400 pounds of additional spacecraft hardware and fuel. Upon hearing this, 
Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., the Mercury flight director, dourly observed that 
this added weight might dangerously degrade the capsule's chances of reaching 
orbit, but Robert R. Gilruth asked Kleinknecht to continue his studies. A few 
days later the Mercury Project Office and the Flight Crew Operations Division 
handed the MSC director a joint proposal for maneuvering an orbiting Mercury 
spacecraft close to a passive Echo-type satellite. But because of time, weight, 
and safety considerations, Gilruth and his management lieutenants rejected the 
proposal, abandoned the idea of a maneuverable Mercury spacecraft for the time 
being, and turned back to the more prosaic but essential business of preparing 
for the modest doubled-distance, six-orbit flight slated for Walter Schirra.<A
