<H1>Epilogue</H1>[505] PROJECT Mercury ended on the threshold of an era of
exploration and discovery that staggers the imagination. Manned space flight of
the most elementary sort had proved so successful that mankind seemed destined
to embark on more ambitious celestial expeditions. The seventh decade of the
20th century also promised the logical extension of manned space flight
technology beyond Earth's orbital corridor. Largely because of Project Mercury,
which fostered Project Apollo and fathered Project Gemini, the United States had
become committed to send men to explore the Moon only 350 years after Galileo
first turned a telescope toward Earth's natural satellite.
<P>Precedents set by Mercury were visible in many different ways to the
taxpayers who watched the plans for NASA's Gemini and Apollo programs take
shape. Most obvious was the configuration of the two-man spacecraft that
McDonnell was building for launches by the Martin Company's Titan II missile.
The Gemini spacecraft was to be a far more sophisticated vehicle, with modular
components easily accessible, with a lift/drag ratio provided by an offset
center of gravity, with a real, if limited, orbital maneuvering capability, and
with ejection seats instead of an escape pylon. Except for its doubled size, its
countersunk viewports, and its lack of the escape tower, however, Gemini looked
much like the familiar Mercury capsule.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>Plans and boilerplate models of the Apollo spacecraft - rather, of the
so-called "command module" that would house three men in a tubby pyramid during
launch and return to Earth, via the Moon - were being tested by airdrops from
airplanes, by a second Little Joe (II) booster series, and by pad aborts using a
tractor-rocket escape pylon. These and other evidences of Mercury's influence on
design, development, testing, and training for more advanced space flights
showed that NASA's new Manned Spacecraft Center and its Marshall, Kennedy, and
Goddard Space Flight Centers were managed and staffed by most of the same
personnel who had formed the original Mercury team. Growth and thoroughgoing
organizational changes affected many individuals adversely, but the core of the
Mercury team moved forward in the mid-1960s toward further exploitation of
"lessons learned" from Mercury for manned space flight at large.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<P>It was primarily to hasten concentration on the accelerated manned space
program and to move away from the "egg-shell" Mercury package and toward [506]
more nearly "first-class" spacecraft accommodations that James E. Webb, Hugh L.
Dryden, and Robert C. Seamans had decided against a fifth manned Mercury-Atlas
mission. NASA administrators wanted to concentrate their engineering talent as
soon and as completely as possible on the next major step toward the Moon. They
realized the political and psychological risks of a lengthy delay before
Americans again went into space, but they took these in stride as necessary to
the longer range goals.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>The week after Mercury was officially terminated, the Soviet Union launched
into orbit <I>Vostok V,</I> carrying Valery F. Bykovsky, and two days later
<I>Vostok VI,</I> with "cosmonette" Valentina V. Tereshkova aboard. Both flights
ended on June 19, 1963, after 81 circuits by Bykovsky and 48 by Tereshkova. The
flights followed slightly different orbital planes, exhibited no co-orbital
maneuvers, and thus were similar to the tandem flights of Andrian Nikolayev and
Pavel Popovich in August 1962. Tereshkova, trained as a parachutist and not as a
pilot, became not only the first woman to go into space but also the first
"layman," or non-pilot-engineer. When later she and Nikolayev were married and
became parents, their healthy and normal baby seemed to indicate that fears
about genetic damage from exposure to cosmic radiation were groundless.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<P>Most significantly, perhaps, <I>Vostoks V</I> and <I>VI</I> apparently
signaled the end of the era of solo space flight. When the Soviets next sent men
into space, on October 12, 1964, they began a new series with <I>Voskhod I,</I>
which carried three men around Earth 16 times. And in 1965, the United States -
taking what comfort it could, said one historian, from the fable of the tortoise
and the hare - began its new Gemini series of twin-seated, maneuverable
satellite missions, which were to make Mercury seem primitive indeed. When in
March and June of that year Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov and Astronaut Edward H.
White took their respective closely tethered "walks" - more nearly "swims" - in
space, the fact that their command pilots were in the spacecraft to help in case
of trouble seemed comforting.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
Neither cosmonauts nor astronauts were ever again likely to go into space alone
in their machines. In this sense only, therefore, man's heroic age of solo space
exploration may be said to have ended in June 1963.
<P>Almost four months after the passing of Mercury and the last Vostok
flights, and only a few weeks before the national shock of President Kennedy's
assassination, NASA and its Manned Spacecraft Center held their formal, public
postmortem on the first American manned satellite program. Staged on October 3
and 4, 1963, at the Music Hall in Houston and attended by some 1300 people from
NASA, the military, industry, and news media, this "Mercury Summary Conference"
featured 20 papers on the overall program, with emphasis on Gordon Cooper's
day-long MA-9 mission of May. Covering program management, booster performance,
astronaut preparation, network operations, and MA-9 inflight experiences and
experiments, these papers constitute the best available technical overview of
Project Mercury.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
<P>The decorous proceedings were marred somewhat on the final day of the
conference [507] by the appearance in newspapers throughout the country of a
controversial story built around three pages of one report.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
In a paper on "Spacecraft Preflight Preparation," four MSC engineers from
Florida sketched the nature and evolution of the intricate and exhaustive
checkout procedures followed at the Cape after McDonnell's delivery of one of
its capsules to the launch site. Discussing "quality assurance," the authors
dwelled on the problem of component defects and malfunctions discovered by
Mercury inspectors in industrial hardware. Inspections for MA-9 turned up 720
system or component discrepancies, 536 of which were attributed to faulty
workmanship. "In Project Mercury," concluded the MSC authors, "thousands of
man-hours were expended in testing, calibration, assembly, and installation of a
variety of hardware that later failed to meet performance specifications or that
malfunctioned during systems tests in a simulated space environment." And often
these delays could have been avoided "if adequate attention to detail during
manufacture or thorough inspection before delivery had been exercised."<A
href="notes.htm#ne.8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>Although the import of this rather didactic engineering treatise was that the
history of Mercury spacecraft prelaunch preparations presented a good object
lesson in the rigorous demands for quality control and reliability testing
before manned space flight - as opposed to missile, instrumented spacecraft, or
even aircraft experience - journalists blew the implied criticism of McDonnell
into a <I>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre.</I> "NASA blasts industry" was the general tenor of the
news dispatches coming out of Houston. Coupled with the General Accounting
Office's contemporaneous criticism of NASA and its contractors in the lagging
Centaur program, the news coverage of the summary conference added some
ammunition for attacks on the "great moondoggle."<A
href="notes.htm#ne.9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>In a hurriedly called press conference in Houston and in hearings the next
week before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, NASA, MSC, and
McDonnell leaders denied that any resentment or dissatisfaction existed because
of anything in past or present NASA-McDonnell relations.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
Congress was satisfied, if the press was not, and this rather small tempest in a
rather large teapot subsided quickly. The furor did suggest, however, that one
of the lessons the Mercury technical staff had not learned well enough was
extreme prudence in all public references to relations between NASA and its
contractors and other agencies. Possibly the "candor at Canaveral" and
elsewhere, for which the press had occasionally commended the Mercury team,
would be the first casualty of the ongoing manned space effort.
<P>In general, the authors of papers read at the Mercury Summary Conference,
aware of the difficulty of making technological and administrative
generalizations in the new and rapidly changing field of astronautics, offered
only guarded conclusions about the significance of Mercury experiences for the
Gemini and Apollo programs. But indirectly there, and more directly elsewhere,
they did assess the state of the art and science of manned space flight, ask
what Mercury had taught that might benefit Gemini and Apollo, and even venture
some answers.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>[508] Project Mercury lasted 55 months, from authorization through the
one-day mission, and while the earliest planned orbital mission slipped 22
months past its first scheduled launch time, Mercury achieved its original
objectives with John Glenn's MA-6 flight only 40 months after formal project
approval. Compared with either advanced missile or aircraft development
programs, this was a good record; but many engineers denied the validity of such
a comparison.
<P>Mercury mobilized a dozen prime contractors, some 75 major subcontractors,
and about 7200 third-tier sub-subcontractors, and vendors, all of whom together
employed at most about two million persons who at one time or another had a
direct hand in the project. In addition, the NASA complement on Mercury
eventually reached 650 workers in the Space Task Group and Manned Spacecraft
Center and 710 elsewhere in research and development support of the project. A
conservative estimate of the maximum number of military servicemen and Defense
Department personnel supporting an individual Mercury mission (both MA-6 and
MA-9) counted 18,000 people, and another conservative estimate added 1169
persons from educational and other civilian institutions. Thus, if the estimate
of 1,817,000 workers employed by the Mercury vendors was too liberal and
unrealistic, the total peak manpower figure of 2,020,528 was probably as
accurate a figure as could be obtained.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>"Quick look" total cost estimates given at the summary conference in October
1963 showed that Mercury had cost $384,131,000 throughout the program, of which
37 percent went for the spacecraft, 33 percent for the tracking network, and 24
percent for launch vehicle procurement. Flight operations and "R and D" costs
made up the remainder, as then estimated, but the final cost accounting was
complicated by the unsettled conditions of closing and disposition costs and the
mingling of Mercury and Gemini costs during 1962 and 1963. Through Glenn's
flight, however, Mercury had cost about $300 million.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
Through Cooper's flight NASA estimated the grand total cost of Mercury at
slightly more than $400 million (see Appendix F).
<P>NASA engineers and physicians listed three primary "lessons learned" from
their experience with Mercury for manned space flight. Their foremost medical
objectives had been fulfilled, and the responses of two men in suborbit and four
men in orbit had shown that human beings can function normally in space if
adequately protected. Rather than acceleration g loads and weightlessness
limiting man's capacity to fly in space, the men who flew Mercury seemed to
adapt to "zero g" surprisingly well. The main medical problems were simple
personal hygiene in flight, and the postflight readjustment symptom of
orthostatic hypotension. Both appeared to be curable by technical developments
rather than by preventive medicine.
<P>Secondly, Mercury had proven that final launch preparations took far more
time than anyone had anticipated in 1958 to ensure perfect readiness and
reliability of the machines and men. NASA had had designed, therefore, an
automated digital system for the future, called "ACE," for Acceptance Checkout
Equipment, [509] to reduce human error in environmental chamber testing and the
length of time required on the flight line at the Florida spaceport. Thirdly,
mission control requirements, integrating the astronaut with his flight monitors
and directors around the world, had grown to encompass the fullest utilization
of real-time telemetry, tracking, computing, and display data. Nothing less
would suffice for future missions. Two more acronyms came into use, "MCC" for
the new Mission Control Center at Houston, and "GOSS" for Ground Operational
Support Systems, reflecting the degree of complex automation being installed for
positive ground control of future space flights.
<P>Studying how they could improve on their performance for succeeding programs,
NASA officials and engineers listed several other valuable technological and
managerial lessons from Mercury. In spacecraft design, problems had been
encountered with safety margins, redundancy, accessibility, shelf-life of parts,
interchangeability, and with materials whose behavior under unfamiliar
environmental conditions had not been wholly predictable. Regarding
qualification of systems and components, there should be more analysis in an
effort to make techniques "conservative, complete, integrated, and functional."
Fabrication and inspection standards carried over from development into
manufacturing work should be made still more "rigorous, detailed, current, and
enforced." Engineers working for the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in Houston
and at the Cape, called for continuous upgrading of tests, inspections, and
other validation procedures, particularly with respect to interface
compatibilities between systems. In configuration control, NASA manned space
flight developers recognized their perennial weight control problem and their
need to become more responsive, more familiar in detail, and more aware of
danger signals in the production and fabrication phases of their business. And
the managers of Mercury now acknowledged that methods of management that had
worked well enough in the first American manned space project would not suit
Gemini and Apollo, already in motion. They had only begun to use the
sophisticated Program Evaluation and Review Technique, called "PERT," which had
evolved from the Navy's experience in its nuclear submarine and Polaris missile
development programs. Now PERT and other management tools, such as the incentive
contract, would have to be exploited to the fullest extent practicable.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>Perhaps the most significant lesson learned from Mercury was that man was
still invaluable to the machine. Mercury saw the evolution of the astronaut from
little more than a passenger in a fully automatic system to an integral and
fully integrated element in the entire space flight organism. By the end of the
project, the Mercury capsule, instead of simply being a machine with a man in
it, had truly become a manned space vehicle. Mercury Flight Director Christopher
C. Kraft, an engineer, spoke for all exponents of manned space flight,
irrespective of discipline: "Man is the deciding element. . . . As long as Man
is able to alter the decision of the machine, we will have a spacecraft that can
perform under any known conditions, and that can probe into the unknown for new
knowledge."<A

<P class="caption">By November 1963, Project Mercury was clearly relegated to
an honorable niche in history. The resources that had fed Project Mercury were
now reorganized and recommitted toward Projects Gemini and Apollo. That
reorientation is underscored in this photograph from President Kennedy's visit

<P>[510] Yet as Mercury faded farther into the past and Gemini and Apollo moved
forward, some profound questions remained unanswered, and indeed usually not
even asked.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
In the democratic society of the United States, did the formal commitment to
costly space exploration, and especially the increased emphasis on manned space
flight beginning in the Kennedy administration, actually represent a consensus
among the electorate? The pace and chances for success of this country's drive
toward spacefaring preeminence depended, finally, on the continued willingness
of the American taxpayer to pay the bills. However divergent may have been the
appeals of the two political parties in the 1964 Presidential election, neither
the Republicans nor Democrats seriously questioned the existence of such a
consensus.
<P>Many more mundane problems plagued the times, some seeming so overwhelming as
to demand dramatic and drastic solutions like those widely presumed to issue
from space technology. But the arrival of the so-called "space age," heralded by
Mercury astronauts and Vostok cosmonauts, did capture most men's
imagination and did seem to dwarf the petty quarrels of men and nations. Vague
hopes for future peace and prosperity accompanied public support of preparations
[511] for two- and three-man spacecraft, but fears about the population
explosion, nuclear proliferation, and social disparities made many wonder
whether the manned space flight enterprise was worth the effort and the price.
Why send two or three men to the Moon when two or three billion others remained
rooted in human turmoil? Questions similar to this found traditional answers in
terms of national security, scientific curiosity, economic benefits, and
technological by-products, but ultimately the national commitment was an act of
faith.
<P>Still, many Americans, both technically literate and illiterate, doubted the
return from the $400 million spent on Project Mercury and the vastly greater
expenditures being allocated for succeeding manned space projects. A substantial
portion of the scientific community agreed with Alvin M. Weinberg, Director of
the Atomic Energy Commission's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who argued that
"most Americans would prefer to belong to a society which first gave the world a
cure for cancer than to the society which put the first astronaut on Mars."<A
href="notes.htm#ne.17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
Others deplored the fact that the American space effort was basically a "race to
the Moon," having no nobler motivation than traditional nationalistic rivalry.
Still others would confine the Nation's astronautical activities to unmanned
instrumented space vehicles, thereby diminishing the cost of space exploration,
as well as presumably avoiding the likely prospect that some day men would die
in space.<A
href="notes.htm#ne.18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>Nevertheless, whether most people in the United States approved or not, in
the mid-1960s it seemed that not only American machines but selected and trained
American citizens were in the space venture to stay. Project Mercury, leaving a
legacy that perhaps was even more important psychologically than
technologically, was already history. Hugh L. Dryden, only a few weeks before
his death late in 1965, expressed his faith in manned space flight and offered a
fitting epitaph for Project Mercury:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Man is distinguished from other forms of life by his powers of
  reasoning and by his spiritual aspirations. Already the events of the last
  seven years have had profound impact on all human affairs throughout the
  world. Repercussions have been felt in science, industry, education,
  government, law, ethics, and religion. No area of human activity or thought
  has escaped. The toys of our children, the ambitions of our young men and
  women, the fortunes of industrialists, the daily tasks of diplomats, the
  careers of military officers, the pronouncements of high church officials -
  all have reflected the all-pervading influence of the beginning steps in space
  exploration. The impact can only be compared with those great developments of
  past history like the Copernican theory which placed the Sun, rather than the
  earth, at the center of our solar system; to the work of Sir Isaac Newton in
  relating the fall of an apple to the motion of the moon around the earth
  through the universal law of gravitation; to the industrial revolution; or to
  other great landmarks in the history of mankind.<A
