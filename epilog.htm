<H1>Epilogue</H1>[505] Project Mercury ended on the threshold of an era of 
exploration and discovery that staggers the imagination. Manned space flight of 
the most elementary sort had proved so successful that mankind seemed destined 
to embark on more ambitious celestial expeditions. The seventh decade of the 
20th century also promised the logical extension of manned space flight 
technology beyond Earth's orbital corridor. Largely because of Project Mercury, 
which fostered Project Apollo and fathered Project Gemini, the United States had 
become committed to send men to explore the Moon only 350 years after Galileo 
first turned a telescope toward Earth's natural satellite.
<P>Precedents set by Mercury were visible in many different ways to the 
taxpayers who watched the plans for NASA's Gemini and Apollo programs take 
shape. Most obvious was the configuration of the two-man spacecraft that 
McDonnell was building for launches by the Martin Company's Titan II missile. 
The Gemini spacecraft was to be a far more sophisticated vehicle, with modular 
components easily accessible, with a lift/drag ratio provided by an offset 
center of gravity, with a real, if limited, orbital maneuvering capability, and 
with ejection seats instead of an escape pylon. Except for its doubled size, its 
countersunk viewports, and its lack of the escape tower, however, Gemini looked 
much like the familiar Mercury capsule.<A

<P>Plans and boilerplate models of the Apollo spacecraft - rather, of the 
so-called "command module" that would house three men in a tubby pyramid during 
launch and return to Earth, via the Moon - were being tested by airdrops from 
airplanes, by a second Little Joe (II) booster series, and by pad aborts using a 
tractor-rocket escape pylon. These and other evidences of Mercury's influence on 
design, development, testing, and training for more advanced space flights 
showed that NASA's new Manned Spacecraft Center and its Marshall, Kennedy, and 
Goddard Space Flight Centers were managed and staffed by most of the same 
personnel who had formed the original Mercury team. Growth and thoroughgoing 
organizational changes affected many individuals adversely, but the core of the 
Mercury team moved forward in the mid-1960s toward further exploitation of 
"lessons learned" from Mercury for manned space flight at large.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<P>It was primarily to hasten concentration on the accelerated manned space 
program and to move away from the "egg-shell" Mercury package and toward [506] 
more nearly "first-class" spacecraft accommodations that James E. Webb, Hugh L. 
Dryden, and Robert C. Seamans had decided against a fifth manned Mercury-Atlas 
mission. NASA administrators wanted to concentrate their engineering talent as 
soon and as completely as possible on the next major step toward the Moon. They 
realized the political and psychological risks of a lengthy delay before 
Americans again went into space, but they took these in stride as necessary to 
the longer range goals.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>The week after Mercury was officially terminated, the Soviet Union launched 
into orbit <I>Vostok V</I>, carrying Valery F. Bykovsky, and two days later 
<I>Vostok VI</I>, with "cosmonette" Valentina V. Tereshkova aboard. Both flights 
ended on June 19, 1963, after 81circuits by Bykovsky and 48 by Tereshkova. The 
flights followed slightly different orbital planes, exhibited no co-orbital 
maneuvers, and thus were similar to the tandem flights of Andrian Nikolayev and 
Pavel Popovich in August 1962. Tereshkova, trained as a parachutist and not as a 
pilot, became not only the first woman to go into space but also the first 
"layman," or non-pilot-engineer. When later she and Nikolayev were married and 
became parents, their healthy and normal baby seemed to indicate that fears 
about genetic damage from exposure to cosmic radiation were groundless.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<P>Most significantly, perhaps, <I>Vostoks V</I> and <I>VI</I> apparently 
signaled the end of the era of solo space flight. When the Soviets next sent men 
into space, on October 12, 1964, they began a new series with <I>Voskhod I</I>, 
which carried three men around Earth 16 times. And in 1965, the United States - 
taking what comfort it could, said one historian, from the fable of the tortoise 
and the hare - began its new Gemini series of twin- seated, maneuverable 
satellite missions, which were to make Mercury seem primitive indeed. When in 
March and June of that year Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov and Astronaut Edward H. 
White took their respective closely tethered "walks" - more nearly "swims" - in 
space, the fact that their command pilots were in the spacecraft to help in case 
of trouble seemed comforting.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> 
Neither cosmonauts nor astronauts were ever again likely to go into space alone 
in their machines. In this sense only, therefore, man's heroic age of solo space 
exploration may be said to have ended in June 1963.
<P>Almost four months after the passing of Mercury and the last <I>Vostok</I> 
flights, and only a few weeks before the national shock of President Kennedy's 
assassination, NASA and its Manned Spacecraft Center held their formal, public 
postmortem on the first American manned satellite program. Staged on October 3 
and 4, 1963, at the Music Hall in Houston and attended by some 1,300 people from 
NASA, the military, industry, and news media, this "Mercury Summary Conference" 
featured 20 papers on the overall program, with emphasis on Gordon Cooper's 
day-long MA-9 mission of May. Covering program management, booster performance, 
astronaut preparation, network operations, and MA-9 in-flight experiences and 
experiments, these papers constitute the best available technical overview of 
Project Mercury.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
<P>The decorous proceedings were marred somewhat on the final day of the 
conference [507] by the appearance in newspapers throughout the country of a 
controversial story built around three pages of one report.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
In a paper on "Spacecraft Preflight Preparation," four MSC engineers from 
Florida sketched the nature and evolution of the intricate and exhaustive 
checkout procedures followed at the Cape after McDonnell's delivery of one of 
its capsules to the launch site. Discussing "quality assurance," the authors 
dwelled on the problem of component defects and malfunctions discovered by 
Mercury inspectors in industrial hardware. Inspections for MA-9 turned up 720 
system or component discrepancies, 536 of which were attributed to faulty 
workmanship. "In Project Mercury," concluded the MSC authors, "thousands of 
man-hours were expended in testing, calibration, assembly, and installation of a 
variety of hardware that later failed to meet performance specifications or that 
malfunctioned during systems tests in a simulated space environment." And often 
these delays could have been avoided "if adequate attention to detail during 
manufacture or thorough inspection before delivery had been exercised."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>Although the import of this rather didactic engineering treatise was that the 
history of Mercury spacecraft prelaunch preparations presented a good object 
lesson in the rigorous demands for quality control and reliability testing 
before manned space flight - as opposed to missile, instrumented spacecraft, or 
even aircraft experience - journalists blew the implied criticism of McDonnell 
into a <I>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</I>. "NASA blasts industry" was the general tenor of the 
news dispatches coming out of Houston. Coupled with the General Accounting 
Office's contemporaneous criticism of NASA and its contractors in the lagging 
Centaur program, the news coverage of the summary conference added some 
ammunition for attacks on the "great moondoggle."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>In a hurriedly called press conference in Houston and in hearings the next 
week before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, NASA, MSC, and 
McDonnell leaders denied that any resentment or dissatisfaction existed because 
of anything in past or present NASA-McDonnell relations.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> 
Congress was satisfied, if the press was not, and this rather small tempest in a 
rather large teapot subsided quickly. The furor did suggest, however, that one 
of the lessons the Mercury technical staff had not learned well enough was 
extreme prudence in all public references to relations between NASA and its 
contractors and other agencies. Possibly the "candor at Canaveral" and 
elsewhere, for which the press had occasionally commended the Mercury team, 
would be the first casualty of the ongoing manned space effort.
<P>In general, the authors of papers read at the Mercury Summary Conference, 
aware of the difficulty of making technological and administrative 
generalizations in the new and rapidly changing field of astronautics, offered 
only guarded conclusions about the significance of Mercury experiences for the 
Gemini and Apollo programs. But indirectly there, and more directly elsewhere, 
they did assess the state of the art and science of manned space flight, ask 
what Mercury had taught that might benefit Gemini and Apollo, and even venture 
some answers.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>[508] Project Mercury lasted 55 months, from authorization through the 
one-day mission, and while the earliest planned orbital mission slipped 22 
months past its first scheduled launch time, Mercury achieved its original 
objectives with John Glenn's MA-6 flight only 40 months after formal project 
approval. Compared with either advanced missile or aircraft development 
programs, this was a good record; but many engineers denied the validity of such 
a comparison.
<P>Mercury mobilized a dozen prime contractors, some 75 major subcontractors, 
and about 7200 third-tier sub-subcontractors, and vendors, all of whom together 
employed at most about two million persons who at one time or another had a 
direct hand in the project. In addition, the NASA complement on Mercury 
eventually reached 650 workers in the Space Task Group and Manned Spacecraft 
Center and 710 elsewhere in research and development support of the project. A 
conservative estimate of the maximum number of military servicemen and Defense 
Department personnel supporting an individual Mercury mission (both MA-6 and 
MA-9) counted 18,000 people, and another conservative estimate added 1,169 
persons from educational and other civilian institutions. Thus, if the estimate 
of 1,817,000 workers employed by the Mercury vendors was too liberal and 
unrealistic, the total peak manpower figure of 2,020,528 was probably as 
accurate a figure as could be obtained.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>"Quick look" total cost estimates given at the summary conference in October 
1963 showed that Mercury had cost $384,131,000 throughout the program, of which 
37 percent went for the spacecraft, 33 percent for the tracking network, and 24 
percent for launch vehicle procurement. Flight operations and "R and D" costs 
made up the remainder, as then estimated, but the final cost accounting was 
complicated by the unsettled conditions of closing and disposition costs and the 
mingling of Mercury and Gemini costs during 1962 and 1963. Through Glenn's 
flight, however, Mercury had cost about $300 million.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> 
Through Cooper's flight NASA estimated the grand total cost of Mercury at 
slightly more than $400 million (see Appendix F).
<P>NASA engineers and physicians listed three primary "lessons learned" from 
their experience with Mercury for manned space flight. Their foremost medical 
objectives had been fulfilled, and the responses of two men in suborbit and four 
men in orbit had shown that human beings can function normally in space if 
adequately protected. Rather than acceleration g loads and weightlessness 
limiting man's capacity to fly in space, the men who flew Mercury seemed to 
adapt to "zero g" surprisingly well. The main medical problems were simple 
personal hygiene in flight, and the postflight readjustment symptom of 
orthostatic hypotension. Both appeared to be curable by technical developments 
rather than by preventive medicine.
<P>Secondly, Mercury had proven that final launch preparations took far more 
time than anyone had anticipated in 1958 to ensure perfect readiness and 
reliability of the machines and men. NASA had had designed, therefore, an 
automated digital system for the future, called "ACE," for Acceptance Checkout 
Equipment, [509] to reduce human error in environmental chamber testing and the 
length of time required on the flight line at the Florida spaceport. Thirdly, 
mission control requirements, integrating the astronaut with his flight monitors 
and directors around the world, had grown to encompass the fullest utilization 
of real-time telemetry, tracking, computing, and display data. Nothing less 
would suffice for future missions. Two more acronyms came into use, "MCC" for 
the new Mission Control Center at Houston, and "GOSS" for Ground Operational 
Support Systems, reflecting the degree of complex automation being installed for 
positive ground control of future space flights.
<P>Studying how they could improve on their performance for succeeding programs, 
NASA officials and engineers listed several other valuable technological and 
managerial lessons from Mercury. In spacecraft design, problems had been 
encountered with safety margins, redundancy, accessibility, shelf-life of parts, 
interchangeability, and with materials whose behavior under unfamiliar 
environmental conditions had not been wholly predictable. Regarding 
qualification of systems and components, there should be more analysis in an 
effort to make techniques "conservative, complete, integrated, and functional." 
Fabrication and inspection standards carried over from development into 
manufacturing work should be made still more "rigorous, detailed, current, and 
enforced." Engineers working for the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in Houston 
and at the Cape, called for continuous upgrading of tests, inspections, and 
other validation procedures, particularly with respect to interface 
compatibilities between systems. In configuration control, NASA manned space 
flight developers recognized their perennial weight control problem and their 
need to become more responsive, more familiar in detail, and more aware of 
danger signals in the production and fabrication phases of their business. And 
the managers of Mercury now acknowledged that methods of management that had 
worked well enough in the first American manned space project would not suit 
Gemini and Apollo, already in motion. They had only begun to use the 
sophisticated Program Evaluation and Review Technique, called "PERT," which had 
evolved from the Navy's experience in its nuclear submarine and Polaris missile 
development programs. Now PERT and other management tools, such as the incentive 
contract, would have to be exploited to the fullest extent practicable.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>Perhaps the most significant lesson learned from Mercury was that man was 
still invaluable to the machine. Mercury saw the evolution of the astronaut from 
little more than a passenger in a fully automatic system to an integral and 
fully integrated element in the entire space flight organism. By the end of the 
project, the Mercury capsule, instead of simply being a machine with a man in 
it, had truly become a manned space vehicle. Mercury Flight Director Christopher 
C. Kraft, an engineer, spoke for all exponents of manned space flight, 
irrespective of discipline: "Man is the deciding element. . . . As long as Man 
is able to alter the decision of the machine, we will have a spacecraft that can 
perform under any known conditions, and that can probe into the unknown for new 
knowledge."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>[510] Yet as Mercury faded farther into the past and Gemini and Apollo moved 
forward, some profound questions remained unanswered, and indeed usually not 
even asked.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> 
In the democratic society of the United States, did the formal commitment to 
costly space exploration, and especially the increased emphasis on manned space 
flight beginning in the Kennedy administration, actually represent a consensus 
among the electorate? The pace and chances for success of this country's drive 
toward spacefaring preeminence depended, finally, on the continued willingness 
of the American taxpayer to pay the bills. However divergent may have been the 
appeals of the two political parties in the 1964 Presidential election, neither 
the Republicans nor Democrats seriously questioned the existence of such a 
consensus.
<P>Many more mundane problems plagued the times, some seeming so overwhelming as 
to demand dramatic and drastic solutions like those widely presumed to issue 
from space technology. But the arrival of the so-called "space age," heralded by 
Mercury astronauts and <I>Vostok</I> cosmonauts, did capture most men's 
imagination and did seem to dwarf the petty quarrels of men and nations. Vague 
hopes for future peace and prosperity accompanied public support of preparations 
[511] for two- and three-man spacecraft, but fears about the population 
explosion, nuclear proliferation, and social disparities made many wonder 
whether the manned space flight enterprise was worth the effort and the price. 
Why send two or three men to the Moon when two or three billion others remained 
rooted in human turmoil? Questions similar to this found traditional answers in 
terms of national security, scientific curiosity, economic benefits, and 
technological by-products, but ultimately the national commitment was an act of 
faith.
<P>Still, many Americans, both technically literate and illiterate, doubted the 
return from the $400 million spent on Project Mercury and the vastly greater 
expenditures being allocated for succeeding manned space projects. A substantial 
portion of the scientific community agreed with Alvin M. Weinberg, Director of 
the Atomic Energy Commission's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who argued that 
"most Americans would prefer to belong to a society which first gave the world a 
cure for cancer than to the society which put the first astronaut on Mars."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> 
Others deplored the fact that the American space effort was basically a "race to 
the Moon," having no nobler motivation than traditional nationalistic rivalry. 
Still others would confine the Nation's astronautical activities to unmanned 
instrumented space vehicles, thereby diminishing the cost of space exploration, 
as well as presumably avoiding the likely prospect that some day men would die 
in space.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/epilog.htm#source18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>Nevertheless, whether most people in the United States approved or not, in 
the mid-1960s it seemed that not only American machines but selected and trained 
American citizens were in the space venture to stay. Project Mercury, leaving a 
legacy that perhaps was even more important psychologically than 
technologically, was already history. Hugh L. Dryden, only a few weeks before 
his death late in 1965, expressed his faith in manned space flight and offered a 
fitting epitaph for Project Mercury: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Man is distinguished from other forms of life by his powers of 
  reasoning and by his spiritual aspirations. Already the events of the last 
  seven years have had profound impact on all human affairs throughout the 
  world. Repercussions have been felt in science, industry, education, 
  government, law, ethics, and religion. No area of human activity or thought 
  has escaped. The toys of our children, the ambitions of our young men and 
  women, the fortunes of industrialists, the daily tasks of diplomats, the 
  careers of military officers, the pronouncements of high church officials - 
  all have reflected the all-pervading influence of the beginning steps in space 
  exploration The impact can only be compared with those great developments of 
  past history like the Copernican theory which placed the Sun, rather than the 
  earth, at the center of our solar system; to the work of Sir Isaac Newton in 
  relating the fall of an apple to the motion of the moon around the earth 
  through the universal law of gravitation; to the industrial revolution; or to 
  other great landmarks in the history of mankind.<A
