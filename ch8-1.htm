<H1>Machine-Rating the Men</H1>
<H2>(January - June 1960)</H2>[223] JUST as the safety of the pilot flying the 
Mercury mission depended primarily on the reliability of the boosters, so the 
overall success of the mission would depend primarily on the adaptability of the 
man inside the capsule. This proposition, recognizing man and machine as 
directly interdependent, had been far from evident at the beginning of the 
project. But by the middle of 1960 the developers of Mercury had encountered 
enough troubles with various automatic systems to dissipate much of their faith 
in automata. They began to believe that it might be simpler to train toward 
human perfection and safer to teach the operations team to act automatically 
than to try to make electromechanical systems operate faultlessly. If the gaps 
left after technologically man-rating the machines could be filled with 
techniques learned by machine-rating the men, then lack of experience need not 
jeopardize either the man or the mission.
<P>Early in 1960 two peerless feats in hydronautics complemented mankind's first 
infantile steps toward astronautics. Two uncommon vessels named <I>Trieste</I> 
and <I>Triton</I>, sponsored by the United States Navy, made voyages probing the 
plenum of the seas only a year before men became able to venture upward into the 
near vacuum. While "space" was being defined popularly as the region above the 
atmosphere and below the ionosphere, man also conquered the aqueous seven-tenths 
of Earth's surface space between the atmosphere and the lithosphere for the 
first time in history. Demonstrating remarkable closed ecological systems and 
significant integrations of men and machines, the <I>Trieste</I> descended to 
the bottom of the deepest known point in the oceans and the <I>Triton</I> 
"orbited" the Earth underwater.<A

<P>The <I>Trieste</I> and <I>Triton</I> voyages symbolized an accelerating 
translation of science fiction into fact at the beginning of the sixth decade of 
the 20th century. These voyages not only dramatically demonstrated man's ability 
to explore and pioneer new frontiers but they also symbolized some complex 
interrelationships in the sociology of science, invention, innovation, and 
discovery. Project Mercury likewise promised to exhibit the social energy of a 
civilization intimately interlocked with industrial technology, governmental 
organization of manpower, and an [224] accumulation of usable knowledge. 
Motivationally, too, Mercury grew out of the curiosity, courage, and creativity 
of individual men who wanted to do "unnatural" deeds. An age-old question of 
humanistic inquiry - what is human nature? - seemed to become rhetorical, and, 
as preparations for manned space flight neared completion, inverted: what is 
<I>not</I> natural to man?
<P>No one doubted at the beginning of 1960 that someone was going upward into 
space shortly, but precisely who, when, where, and even why were highly 
controversial questions. NASA Administrator T. Keith Glennan predicted the first 
Mercury suborbital flight within the year. Soviet spokesmen previewed their 
mid-January rocket tests over the Pacific as a preparation for placing man in 
space. Winds from conflicting opinions expressed by political, military, 
scientific, and industrial critics of American policy regarding space technology 
began to brew some squalls when NASA asked that almost $108 million of its total 
budget request of $802 million be appropriated for manned space flight 
development in fiscal 1961. Whether Mercury would finally cost $250 or $350 
million, as was now variously estimated, it would still be a small fraction of 
the cost of the great Saturn rocket, not to mention other NASA projects.<A

<P>While the Eisenhower administration rejected the "space race" image attached 
to Mercury, Congress pressed for a greater sense of urgency, NASA Headquarters 
sought supplemental funds, and the Space Task Group concentrated on reconciling 
schedules with quality control. There was a detente in the cold war until the 
controversial U-2 incident in May 1960. But even during this thaw STG, as the 
technical coaching staff for the prime American contestant, became steadily more 
enmeshed in the confused competition between the United States and the Soviet 
Union to be first with its man in space. While Maxime A. Faget was being honored 
as one of the top 10 young men in government service for his designs of the 
Mercury capsule, couch, and escape concepts, Abe Silverstein stated publicly, 
"We feel no urgency to move the program unsafely." But the political pressure to 
produce would increase rapidly as 1960 wore on.<A

<P>At the end of January, Little Joe 1-B finally, with a boilerplate capsule, 
proved the basic aerodynamic viability of the Mercury abort concept. McDonnell 
Aircraft corporation's first production hardware, which happened to be capsule 
No. 4, was delivered on demand only half-finished to Langley, where it was 
fitted with instruments like Big Joe's for the first flight to mate the Atlas 
booster with the "real McDonnell" head. As it turned out, the only other flight 
test for Mercury during this half year occurred at Wallops Island on May 9. 
There and then, McDonnell's Mercury capsule No. 1, so named because it had been 
first on the assembly line, was yanked by its escape rocket from the beach abort 
position to begin successfully the qualifying flights for the McDonnell capsule. 
It took only 14 months to build and deliver this first capsule with its most 
critical systems ready to be qualified for basic technical performance. 
Meanwhile qualification tests in laboratories began in earnest. No mechanisms 
were more difficult to qualify than those most intimately related to the human 
system.

Marianas Trench, an abyssal canyon north of Guam, also known as the Challenger 
Deep, while Jacques Piccard, the son of Auguste who had designed the 
<I>Trieste</I>, and Donald Walsh, a Navy lieutenant, squeezed themselves into 
the bathyspherical gondola beneath their hydrostatic balloon. In this third of a 
series of dives, Piccard and Walsh sank down 7000 fathoms, or eight miles, where 
their vehicle endured 1085 tons of pressure per square foot and where they saw 
life on the bottom of the ocean. For all mankind, Piccard and Walsh figuratively 
"took possession of the abyss, the last extreme on our Earth that remained 
unconquered." Three months later, on April 25, 1960, the nuclear-powered 
submarine <I>Triton</I>, with 183 Americans captained by Edward L. Beach, 
completed the world's first undersea circumnavigation, following for two months 
submerged the wake of Magellan's ship, the <I>Victoria</I>, at an average speed 
of 18 knots for 41,519 miles. The inertial guidance navigation system that made 
the trip of the <I>Triton</I> possible had grown out of the same research and 
development program, Project Navaho, that had provided the prototype rocket 
engine for the Redstone, Jupiter/Polaris, Thor, Atlas, and Titan.
