<H1>Longer Legs for Mercury</H1>Specific planning for MA-8 had begun back in 
February during the technical debriefing of John Glenn following the MA-6 
mission. While attending the Grand Turk Island meetings, Kleinknecht and Donald 
K. Slayton had agreed that a flight of six or seven orbits seemed to be a 
logical intermediate step from the three-pass flight of Glenn toward an ultimate 
18-orbit goal then under study. When Kleinknecht returned to his office (then at 
Langley) he put his staff to work in conjunction with John F. Yardley's group of 
McDonnell engineers on the changes necessary to accomplish a seven-orbit Mercury 
flight.<A

<P>[463] The staff's problem was to appraise the spacecraft components' lifetime 
in terms of the ability of each system to perform two or three times longer than 
the operating limits originally built into them. Flight rules so far had 
specified an almost continuous operation of the automatic stabilization and 
control system, which caused a heavy drain on the spacecraft's electrical power 
supply. Also critical were oxygen reserves, reaction control fuel supplies, and 
increased recovery requirements. The tracking and communications network, built 
for three-orbit coverage, would require extensive modification if the tracking 
criteria applied to three orbits should apply to six or seven.
<P>The three-orbit Mercury spacecraft, with all its electrically powered systems 
in action, consumed about 7,080 watt-hours of battery power from a total of 
about 13,500 watt-hours available. Thus a seven-orbit mission, obeying previous 
flight rules, would consume about 11,190 watt-hours, leaving a reserve supply of 
only 6.7 percent. Mercury Project Office engineers insisted there should be at 
least a 10 percent postlanding reserve as a safety factor and suggested at least 
two conservation methods to attain and surpass this amount. One was drawn from 
an earlier recommendation presented by McDonnell designers and planners; they 
had outlined possibilities for an 18-orbit mission, proposing that some of the 
systems be turned off during a substantial portion of the flight. In addition to 
this, the MSC engineers recommended switching telemetry transmitter and radar 
beacon operations to ground command. These measures, they felt, would raise the 
reserve power levels to about 15 percent.
<P>After studying the spacecraft's environmental control system, the project 
engineers at MSC concluded that about 4.4 pounds of oxygen would be consumed 
during a seven-orbit flight, taking pilot usage and cabin leakage rates into 
consideration. By prevailing mission rules, this would leave an insufficient 
supply to meet possible contingencies of abnormal recovery. A supply of 8.6 
pounds would meet the requirement, but the system carried only two 4-pound 
capacity bottles. So, either the rules had to be relaxed or the system had to be 
modified. The MSC study group recommended the modification possibility, adding 
that a strenuous program to reduce cabin leakage rates to 600 cubic centimeters 
per minute should be started. Formerly up to 1,000 cubic centimeters had been 
within design specifications. To cover the increase in carbon dioxide production 
from the longer flight, the project office planners pointed out that the 
canister carried in the three-orbit spacecraft could be filled with lithium 
hydroxide to its 5.4 pound capacity. This amount represented an increase from 
the 4.6 pounds that had been carried on the three-pass flights and should be 
sufficient extension of the C0<SUB>2</SUB> removal capability.
<P>At the same time that these efforts were being made to provide the spacecraft 
systems with all the power they needed and the astronaut with enough breathable 
oxygen, some NASA and McDonnell engineers were wrestling with more advanced 
problems of tripling, quadrupling, and even raising by factors of six and eight 
the capabilities of the Mercury spacecraft to orbit Earth. But at this stage, 
planning for the day-long, 18-orbit mission depended heavily on some positive 
proof [464] from MA-8 that man and machines could tolerate, over a longer period 
and with larger margins for pilot safety and mission success, the vacuous, 
weightless, hot-cold extremes of space.
<P>The most critical problem in preparations for the extended mission was 
providing enough hydrogen peroxide fuel to power the capsule's reaction control 
system. A seven-orbit mission operating in the fully automatic control mode 
would consume about 28 pounds of fuel, providing the systems were functioning 
normally. The Mercury Project Office suggested alternating a combination of 
automatic and manual modes to provide safer fuel reserves at the end of the 
flight. Such a procedure would expend 23 pounds of automatic and 18 pounds of 
manual fuel, leaving reserves of 12 and 15 pounds, respectively. Then, in case 
of malfunction in one of the control modes, the astronaut would be assured of an 
adequate fuel supply in the other mode.
<P>Recovery procedures changed considerably for the proposed seven-orbit 
mission. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh sinusoidal curves of the orbital 
ground trace passed over geographical points that almost intersected, while the 
fifth and sixth orbits did intersect in the northern Pacific about 275 miles 
northeast of Midway Island. This pattern shifted to the Pacific Ocean the 
optimum recovery area that had been in the Atlantic for MA-4 through MA-7. 
Kleinknecht's staff pointed out that a once-an-orbit primary recovery capability 
could be maintained with only a slight increase in the recovery forces. The 
primary landing area during the seventh orbit could be covered easily by Navy 
vessels moving to the zone from their base at Pearl Harbor, but some of the 
aircraft staging bases for past contingency landing areas would have to be 
relocated.
<P>Then Sigurd A. Sjoberg, Robert F. Thompson, and other mission and recovery 
planners discovered a slight flaw in the seven-orbit flight profile. A hard 
mission rule required a contingency recovery capability within 18 hours after 
landing. This requirement could be easily met for a six-orbit mission, but 
adding a seventh orbit required additional recovery forces to satisfy that 
mission rule. So NASA decided to make MA-8 a six-orbit flight.<A

<P>During August 1962 the MA-8 mission planners continued to wrestle with many 
other operational considerations. But within the month they were able to issue 
the mission rules, data acquisition plan, a slight revision to the flight plan, 
recovery requirements and procedures, and the mission directive, only to find on 
some occasions that closer study of engineering preparations revealed new 
constraints, requiring minor changes to most of their guidebooks.<A
