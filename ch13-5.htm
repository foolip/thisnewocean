<H1>The Hero</H1>The American reaction to this country's first manned orbital 
flight was a mixture of relief, pride, and exaltation. From the Rose Garden at 
the White House, President Kennedy echoed the sentiments of the Nation:<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-5.htm#source50"><SUP>50</SUP></A> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>I know that I express the great happiness and thanksgiving of all 
  of us that Colonel Glenn has completed his trip, and I know that this is 
  particularly felt by Mrs. Glenn and his two children.
  <P>I also want to say a word for all of those who participated with Colonel 
  Glenn at Canaveral. They faced many disappointments and delays - the burdens 
  upon them were great - but they kept their heads and they made a judgment, and 
  I think their judgment has been vindicated.
  <P>We have a long way to go in this space race. But this is the new ocean, and 
  I believe the United States must sail on it and be in a position second to 
  none.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>[435] Not only Americans but friendly foreigners hastened 
to add their praises for Glenn and Project Mercury. India's news media gave the 
flight top billing over an important national election. Most of the South 
American press viewed the space gap as already closed or being closed, while a 
sense of relief that a more favorable balance of power existed was evident in 
the African newspapers. Western Europeans were pleased with the openness of the 
undertaking, with the fact, frequently mentioned, that the United States had not 
used this momentous event to intimidate either opponent or neutral, and that the 
astronaut had kept his inflight remarks strictly apolitical. Numerous 
expressions of hope were voiced, as Khrushchev suggested and Kennedy repeated 
that Russians and Americans could enter into some sort of cooperative space 
program.<A

<P>The men of NASA, the Defense Department, and the aerospace industry viewed 
the feat more prosaically. They realized something of its impact on mankind, but 
most of their pride stemmed from the smooth-working demonstration of their space 
hardware and the recovery forces in action. And their interest quickly returned 
to the tasks of full exploitation of men and machines for Mercury.
<P>Those who in the past had been the targets of technical kibitzing, domestic 
skepticism, and political pressure now were lauded by the American press for 
having "stuck by their guns." Periodicals praised Hugh L. Dryden, Robert R. 
Gilruth, Williams, Faget, Kraft, George M. Low, and Hartley A. Soulé, the 
"leaders of this technical team who did their work on civil service pay and sold 
no serial rights to national magazines. . . ."<A

<P>The MA-6 honors and celebrations consumed several days. Glenn, his family, 
Vice-President Johnson, and the Mercury entourage passed in review on February 
26 before an estimated 250,000 people lining rainy streets in Washington, after 
which the astronaut gave a 20-minute informal report to a joint session of 
Congress. New York City proclaimed March 1 "John Glenn Day," and Mayor Robert 
Wagner presented medals to Glenn and Gilruth. The next day there was an informal 
reception in honor of the orbiting American at United Nations Headquarters. 
Glenn then journeyed to his home town, New Concord (population 2,300), Ohio, 
where about 75,000 greeted him on March 3.
<P>While everyone else feted Glenn, Mercury and contractor engineers at the Cape 
subjected his spaceship to a minute examination. Except for the usual 
discoloration, the interior and exterior of the capsule were in excellent 
condition. In several places where there were separations between the shingles, 
deposits of aluminum alloy had accumulated from the disintegration of the 
retrorocket package during reentry. A brownish film of undetermined origin 
covered the exterior surface of the window. Heatshield slices and cores showed 
about the same minor char depth found after the MA-4 and MA-5 missions; the 
center plug was sticking out about half an inch. There was also a wedge-shaped 
darker area on the shield, striated by several radial marks about four inches 
long, which the inspectors theorized was caused by the slipping retropack. [436] 
The investigation team also found that the rotary switch that was to be actuated 
by the heatshield deployment had a loose stem, causing the electrical contact to 
break when the stem was moved up and down. This, they believed, accounted for 
the false deploy signal that worried everyone so much during the flight. 
Although there were several tears in the landing bag, caused either by impact or 
retrieval handling, for the first time no cables or straps in the landing system 
were broken. And while the lower pressure bulkhead again was slightly damaged, 
the equipment there escaped harm.<A

<P>After this thorough postflight analysis, Glenn's spacecraft, McDonnell 
capsule No. 13, went on a global tour, popularly known as the "fourth orbit of 
<I>Friendship 7</I>." Literally millions of people stood patiently in line to 
look inside the spacecraft as it was exhibited in 17 countries and Hawaii. By 
August 1962 <I>Friendship 7</I> had reached the "Century 21 Exposition" at 
Seattle. There, thousands more viewed the craft that had carried man on an 
orbital journey through space. Finally, on the first anniversary of its voyage, 
<I>Friendship 7</I> came officially to rest near the Wright Brothers' original 
airplane and Lindbergh's <I>Spirit of St. Louis</I> in the Smithsonian 
Institution.<A
