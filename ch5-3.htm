<H1>The People In Charge</H1>Glennan and Dryden decided many questions of 
appointment quite naturally by allowing informal working arrangements to become 
formal. Glennan's fellow Clevelander, Abe Silverstein, Associate Director of 
NACA's Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, was appointed Director of Space 
Flight Development. Silverstein had been the technical director of research at 
Lewis since 1949 and had worked closely with Dryden since March and with Glennan 
since August in [113] planning the early organization of NASA.<A

As reflected by his title, manned programs per se were supposed to occupy only 
about one-third of Silverstein's time. He brought with him from Cleveland three 
other scientist-administrators of demonstrated talents to handle most of his 
staff work concerning the manned satellite program, which then was a minor 
portion of Silverstein's responsibility compared with his concerns over 
propulsion development. Newell D. Sanders became Silverstein's Assistant 
Director for Advanced Technology. But the primary relations between Washington 
and the field activities for manned space flight development were to be handled 
by George M. Low, who eventually became chief of an Office of Manned Space 
Flight, and Warren J. North, a former NACA test pilot who at first headed an 
Office of Manned Satellites, then of Space Flight Programs. Dryden and Glennan 
depended heavily upon Silverstein and his aides for the technical review and 
supervision of the division of labor among the various NASA field centers. But 
the locus of manned space flight preparations remained with the small group of 
Langley and Lewis personnel under Gilruth, the group that had zealously 
researched, planned, and designed what was to become Project Mercury.
<P>Dryden desired to conserve the character of the three primary NACA centers as 
national laboratories specializing as necessary in applied and advanced research 
for aeronautics and astronautics. Glennan agreed to assign the large new 
development and operational programs to distinct, or at least reorganized, 
groups of people. The directors of the Langley, Ames, and Lewis Research Centers 
should continue their aeronautical and missile work with a minimum of 
disturbance while expanding the proportion of their research devoted to space. 
NASA Headquarters personnel, temporarily located in the Dolley Madison House, 
across Lafayette Square from the White House, should be able to coordinate 
agency-wide activities without too much interference in the high degree of local 
autonomy at the research laboratories near airfields in Virginia, California, 
and Ohio.
<P>With the birth of NASA all the former NACA laboratories had their names 
changed. Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, from 1920 until 1940 the 
first and only research lab for NACA, became on October 1, 1958, the Langley 
Research Center. Located on the Virginia peninsula, across Hampton Roads from 
Norfolk, the Langley laboratories flanked one side of old Langley Field, one of 
the pioneer U.S. military airfields; for 10 years now the Air Force had called 
it the Langley Air Force Base. NASA's 700 acres there contained buildings and 
hangars more permanent and other structures more unusual than were normally 
found at military airfields. On opposite edges of the runways, about 3,000 
civilians in 1958 worked at facilities worth more than $150 million. About 700 
of these people were professional engineers and self-made scientists whose major 
tools were 30 different wind tunnels. Also they had experimental models, 
operating aircraft, shops, and laboratories for chemistry, physics, electronics, 
and hydrodynamics.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-3.htm#source9"><SUP>9</A></SUP>
<P>As a national aeronautical laboratory Langley supported little if any "pure" 
[114] or "basic" science, in the sense of independent individual investigations 
in pursuit of knowledge as opposed to utility. But it had long provided a 
world-renowned institutional setting for "applied science." Both research and 
development were carried on there without prejudice.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-3.htm#source10"><SUP>10</A></SUP>
<P>Now that the "sky" was to be redefined in terms of "aerospace," man's mastery 
of dimensions at least five times higher than he had ever flown required 
radically new social as well as technological inventions. Silverstein was asked 
by Dryden to help Gilruth create an entirely new management organization, 
composed primarily of Langley personnel, without disrupting other work in 
progress. The Director of Langley Research Center, Henry J. E. Reid, was on the 
verge of retirement, and responsibility for administering Langley had devolved 
to Floyd L. Thompson. Neither Reid nor Thompson was close enough to the manned 
satellite working level, where events were moving so rapidly, to assume charge 
of the special organization taking shape there.
<P>The project director of the manned satellite program should therefore be the 
man who had already directed it through its gestation period - Robert R. 
Gilruth. As Assistant Director of Langley and the former chief of the Pilotless 
Aircraft Research Division (PARD), he had long nurtured Maxime A. Faget and his 
associates, the conceptual designers of the NACA manned satellite. After the 
consolidation of professional consensus at Langley behind the Faget plan in 
March 1958, Dryden and his Washington associates Ira H. Abbott and John W. 
Crowley, Jr., had given Gilruth authority to get underway.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-3.htm#source11"><SUP>11</A></SUP>
<P>Gilruth had come to Langley after earning his master's degree in aeronautical 
engineering at the University of Minnesota under Professor Jean Piccard in 1936. 
He had been a leader in research during the development of transonic and 
supersonic aircraft, becoming the man in charge of structures, dynamic loads, 
and pilotless aircraft studies at Langely in 1952. During the decade of guided 
missile development, Gilruth had served on some six scientific advisory 
committees for the military services and for NACA. His eminence was widely 
recognized both as a scientist-engineer and as a research administrator. 
Furthermore, he was eager to continue his leadership of the vigorous group of 
younger engineers working with Faget.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-3.htm#source12"><SUP>12</A></SUP>
<P>As soon as Gilruth and Faget returned with Glennan's verbal approval "to 
implement the manned satellite project," Thompson, acting director of Langley, 
began making arrangements to establish in separate facilities at the Unitary 
Wind Tunnel Building the self-appointed group already working on space flight. 
Charles J. Donlan, Technical Assistant to the Director of Langley, was asked to 
serve as Assistant Project Manager. Under Gilruth and Donlan, 33 Langley 
personnel, 25 of these engineers (14 of them from PARD), were officially 
transferred on November 5, 1958, to form the nucleus of a separate organization 
to be called the Space Task Group.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-3.htm#source13"><SUP>13</A></SUP>
<P>Although the new Task Group was responsible directly to Washington, its 
initial composition and actions were left largely to local initiative. The 
Langley [115] group had anticipated by two months the official actions and had 
discussed organization of a "Manned Ballistic Satellite Task Group." Called by 
some of its secretaries the "Space Task Force," it had acquired 10 to 15 men 
from Lewis Research Center when Silverstein in July had directed them to commute 
to Langley to aid in working out detailed designs for structure, thermal 
protection, and instrumentation in the program. This informal Langley-Lewis 
working arrangement gradually integrated and expanded as the Space Task Group 
took shape through the following year.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-3.htm#source14"><SUP>14</A></SUP>
<P>Gilruth's authorization gave him two hats: one as project manager of the 
Space Task Group, and the other - announced May 1, 1959 - as assistant director 
of a new NASA "space projects center" to be located near Greenbelt, Maryland, 
about 15 miles northeast of the Nation's capital. In Washington, Dryden and 
Silverstein were making plans for this space development facility to accommodate 
the NASA inheritance of Project Vanguard and about 150 of its personnel, 
transferred from the Naval Research Laboratory. Such a facility might easily 
double as an operations control center. At this time the scientific and 
operational aspects of manned satellites appeared to complement the tracking 
network and instrumentation for the Vanguard satellites. So as soon as the 
building could be constructed on an agricultural experimental farm at 
Beltsville, Maryland, the Space Task Group would move there. In the interim 
Langley would continue to furnish lodging and logistic support while a space 
flight operations center was being built. All this was to change about two years 
later when it became apparent that the scope, size, and support for manned space 
endeavors called for an entirely separate center.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-3.htm#source15"><SUP>15</A></SUP>
<P>Everyone connected with the Space Task Group in the first several months of 
its existence was too busy preparing and mailing specifications, briefing 
prospective contractors, and evaluating contractor proposals to take much 
interest in organization charts. A kind of executive committee, forming around 
Gilruth and Donlan during November and December, gradually organized itself 
along functional lines. Gilruth and Donlan, Faget and Paul E. Purser, Charles W. 
Mathews, and Charles H. Zimmerman formed the core of this first executive 
council. Other senior NACA engineers on the original STG personnel list, men 
like Aleck C. Bond, Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., Howard C. Kyle, George F. 
MacDougall, Jr., and Harry H. Ricker, Jr., also played important roles in the 
initial formulation of the technological plan of attack.
<P>Of the 35 members of the original group from Langley, only eight provided 
administrative or clerical services. Thus, with the 10 additional-people from 
the Lewis laboratory, Gilruth and Donlan had 35 scientist-engineers to assign to 
specific technical problems. Those 14 who came directly from PARD continued 
working on implementing their designs, as they had been doing for almost a year. 
Five men came from the Flight Research Division of Langley, two came from the 
Instrument Research Division, two from the Stability Research Division, and one 
each from the Dynamic Loads and Full-Scale Tunnel Research Divisions. [116] Some 
of these, men like William M. Bland, Jr., John P. Mayer, Robert G. Chilton, 
Jerome B. Hammack, Jack C. Heberlig, William T. Lauten, Jr., and Alan B. Kehlet, 
had made substantial professional investments in the space flight program at a 
time when this was still some risk to their careers. Being a Buck Rogers buff 
was not yet quite respectable.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-3.htm#source16"><SUP>16</A></SUP>
<P>From Glennan's approval of the project until the formal establishment of the 
Space Task Group on November 5, and indeed for some months later, it was by no 
means certain how much support and what priority the manned satellite program 
might receive. Some NACA careerists were hesitant to join an operation that 
might easily prove abortive. So far Gilruth had no specified billets to fill nor 
any public, formal mandate from Headquarters. He and Silverstein worked together 
very closely through the shuttle service of George Low on Silverstein's staff, 
who divided his time between Washington and STG. The hectic early days, 
cluttered and confused, made the future of the Task Group appear less than 
certain. Although NASA Headquarters had received from ARPA and allocated to 
Langley the necessary funds to get started, NASA seemed to prefer the science 
programs it had inherited along with instrumented satellites. The Space Task 
Group wanted full and explicit support of the development engineering necessary 
for a manned satellite. But the members did not let lack of documented clarity 
from the policy level dampen their enthusiasm or activity. Throughout October, 
trips and conferences by key personnel verified at the working level and in the 
field what could and could not be done to implement policy planning in 
Washington. To many of the younger engineers under Gilruth, NASA's initial 
organizational confusion offered opportunity for initiative at the local level 
to accomplish more than directives from Headquarters in getting an American into 
orbit.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch5-3.htm#source17"><SUP>17</A></SUP>
<P>In order to avoid the danger of converting the Langley Research Center into 
Langley "Research and Development" Center, Dryden insisted that the Space Task 
group should be separated from the mother institution and attached to the 
Beltsville Center. Some Langley engineers welcomed the opportunity to 
participate in a full-fledged development program; others, more 
research-oriented, abhorred the idea. In managing the Space Task Group, Gilruth 
had to reconcile these attitudes, to recruit talent and screen zeal, and to 
create an organization capable of developing into hardware what had been 
conceived in research.

staff consisted of "aeronautical research engineers." Since about 1954 some 
engineers, recruited from industry or from "accredited" schools of aeronautics, 
together with senior and most valuable members of the NACA laboratory teams, had 
been given more nearly competitive salaries and the title of "aeronautical 
research scientist." College accreditation and comparative evaluation were as 
problematical in this as in any other field, but institutions with high 
reputations for excellence in aeronautical engineering and aerodynamics included 
the California and Massachusetts Institutes of Technology, Stanford, Michigan 
State, and Cornell Universities, and many others certified by various 
professional societies.
<P>
<P><A name=source10><SUP>10</A> </SUP>A few generalizations may be hazarded 
about Langley before 1959. Most of its professional staff came from the South 
and Midwest; few had been academically trained as aeronautical engineers; most 
held only bachelor's degrees, usually in mechanical or electrical engineering, 
often from Georgia Institute of Technology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, or 
Auburn University. An esprit de corps based on many years of valuable service to 
aviation and to the nation seems to have been pervasive. And certainly the 
Langley professional people always would insist on their own experience and 
contributions as having proved the artificiality of invidious distinctions 
between science and engineering. Most helpful for understanding the nature of 
governmental management of applied science is David Novick, "What Do We Mean By 
Research and Development?" in <I>California Management Review</I> (Spring 1960), 
21, as quoted in Merton J. Peck and Frederick M. Scherer, <I>The Weapons
