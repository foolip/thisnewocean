From Development into Qualification: Flight Tests<BR>
<SPAN>(July&ndash;December 1960)</SPAN></H2>
<P>[263] IN mid-1960, NASA and its Space Task Group hoped
soon to begin launching a major qualification flight test for Project Mercury
every six weeks. If all went well, these tests of the operational vehicles
should permit a man to ride into space before the end of the year. But if
Mercury's developmental experience to date was any guide, troubles could be
expected to pyramid and might require more than six months to correct. Since the
ultimate goal of Project Mercury was to achieve man-in-orbit rather than merely
a sounding-rocket ride by a man into space, the Task Group would be running
concurrent flight tests with the Little Joe, the Mercury-Redstone, and the
Mercury-Atlas combinations. But attention and impetus were focused on the
accomplishment of manned orbital circumnavigation.
<P>NASA Administrator T. Keith Glennan sent a memorandum to his Director of
Space Flight Programs, Abe Silverstein, on July 11, 1960, prompting him to make
every effort to put forward to November the launch of MR-3, long designated the
first manned suborbital flight. If that was not possible, Glennan urged
Silverstein to hold fast the schedule for the first manned launching before the
end of the year. Silverstein replied that the manned event had just been reset
for the week of December 5. By mid-August 1960 the most realistic estimate of
the earliest possible man-launching changed the program management plans once
again and reset the MR-3 launching for mid-January 1961. As late as October
1960, this optimism prevailed while work on capsule No. 7 for MR-3 proceeded
"somewhat better than expected."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>Having once called the Army's stillborn Project Adam a "circus stunt" because
it proposed little more than shooting a man into space, Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy
Administrator of NASA, had himself set a precedent for the criticisms of those
influential scientists who came to regard Project Mercury as more of an
exhibition than a demonstration. During 1959 few had raised their voices against
NASA's plans and STG's development program for a manned satellite. But during
this election year of 1960, many citizens scrutinized - and Eisenhower even
established a commission to study - all national policies, goals, and ideals.
[264] This White House-sanctioned introspection led to some criticism, not
entirely constructive, of the civilian space agency, which all too often was
equated with Project Mercury.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<P>Most Americans appeared to approve Mercury as a potentially stupendous
adventure, and many Congressmen anxiously hoped that NASA would mobilize the
Nation's vaunted technological know-how to put the first man above the
atmosphere. Although Dryden, George M. Low, and other NASA officials recently
had warned repeatedly that the Russians could and likely would achieve manned
space flight first, no one in NASA seemed to wonder whether the Soviets would
send men on ballistic suborbital missions before committing a man to orbital
flight. Most citizens seemed to confuse their feelings of hurt pride with loss
of prestige and were reluctant to accept Eisenhower's difficult rationalization
that America should abjure any "space race" with Soviet Russia. But NASA
followed Eisenhower's leadership in this matter and reinforced the official
attitude by insisting that Mercury was an "R and D" program whose pace could not
be forced.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>Glennan in his public statements appeared torn between the pressures of
public sentiment expressed through Congress and the news media, on one hand, and
the demands of loyalty to the Chief Executive and to technological realism, on
the other. Aware of the Nation's late start in rocket propulsion development and
yet of its amazingly rapid achievement of a workable ICBM, Glennan knew that the
United States still did not have the weight-lifting prowess to join an avowed
contest with the U.S.S.R. But Glennan also shared the aerospace community's
satisfaction on May 20, 1960, when the Atlas first flew higher than 1000 miles
and over 9014 miles downrange from Cape Canaveral into the Indian Ocean. By this
time the Thor and Jupiter intermediate-range missiles were operationally
deployed abroad. The Titan ICBM, in spite of some developmental failures, was
emerging into a second-generation intercontinental missile.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<P>Mercury still was only a fractional part of NASA's total space effort, but
publicity and public interest had reinforced each other until the manned program
clearly had become the most promising hope of "beating" the Russians into space.
When the Soviets orbited <I>Korabl Sputnik II</I> on August 19 and the next day
recovered two dogs, Strelka and Belka, from it, grounds for complacency among
Americans evaporated.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
National phobias, stimulated by partisan criticism of the alleged "missile
gap," were further distorted by technological chauvinism with respect to Soviet
accomplishments in space. Popular attitudes were exacerbated after the "spirit
of Camp David" was destroyed by the U-2 incident and after Khrushchev used the
U-2 affair to destroy the summit conference in Paris.
<P>Speculations on high policy and international relations were not the business
of the field workers on the Mercury program. But as citizens they could not
avoid being aware of some wondrous possibilities for the historic significance
of their work. Both landlubbers and space lovers could find many excellent
reasons to think that the ICBM and nuclear warheads might possibly become
plowshares of peace rather than tools of terror if directed toward the
exploration of space. [265] Peaceful coexistence and even international
cooperation might be force-fed by the exorbitant economics of the competition to
put men into orbit. Whatever one's particular brand of concern, there were
motives aplenty to work on Project Mercury.
<P>Toward the end of June 1960, the Space Task Group took another hard look at
the status of Project Mercury. Having formalized three separate series of
engineering inspections and tests - progressing from development through
qualification into reliability phases - STG faced with increased confidence some
criticism from technical associates. It felt it could gauge accurately the soft
spots in the major systems for Mercury. Of the 17 nominal systems for the
capsule, all but five or six by June were reported finished with qualification
tests and almost done with reliability testing. The major unfinished items were
the reaction control system, pyrotechnics, the retrograde and posigrade rockets,
and the satellite clock.
<P>Capsule system tests had revealed that certain pressure regulators, solenoid
and relief valves, and thrust chambers for the reaction controls using corrosive
hydrogen peroxide were going to be troublesome when operating in a high vacuum.
On the other hand, the environmental system was progressing better than
expected, with only five components still unqualified: the emergency oxygen
bottle, a pressure reducer assembly, the odor and carbon dioxide absorber, a
high-pressure oxygen transducer, and a suit-circuit water separator. The abort
sensing and implementation system (ASIS) for the Atlas was 95 percent qualified,
but its counterpart for the Redstone was not.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
<P>The communications and tracking network faced four outstanding problems: no
one had much experience with Atlas guidance and tracking at long ranges and low
elevation angles; the reliability of the high-speed data links was unknown;
capsule antenna patterns were erratic enough to make radar acquisition
problematic; and control procedures and techniques as yet were untried.
<P>Astronaut training, the Task Group believed, was virtually complete for
disorientation, tumbling, and familiarization with high levels of carbon dioxide
absorption. Adaptation to weightlessness and lectures on space sciences were 90
percent complete, but training in navigation and communications (at reduced
pressures and with high heating, noise, and vibration rates) was less than a
third finished. The training of ground crews in procedures for preparing,
launching, and monitoring an astronaut in flight had only just begun. And NASA's
planning for recovery operations in the summer of 1960 was grandiose, asking
"virtually for the deployment of the whole Atlantic fleet." This requirement
came down abruptly after NASA met with the Navy at the Pentagon and was shown
that fleet operations of this scope might cost more than the entire Mercury
program.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
<P>The climax of the debate over reliability analyses came in early summer 1960,
when NASA Headquarters decided to issue an independent contract with McDonnell
for making assurance doubly sure. Associate Administrator Richard E. Horner and
his deputy, Nicholas E. Golovin, the mathematical systems analyst who had come
to NASA from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, achieved [266] their first
point on June 9, 1960, when a separate contract with McDonnell was signed for a
reliability study of all Mercury capsule systems. Estimated to cost $52,892 with
a fixed fee of $3,323 and planned to be administered by the Bureau of Naval
Weapons representatives in St. Louis, this small contract was designed to
provide Horner's office with the data it needed to analyze and evaluate the
reliability efforts and achievements of McDonnell, of all 10 capsule
subcontractors, of some 200 suppliers, and indirectly of STG's reliability
monitoring and mission planning.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>Golovin's approach to a reliability prediction program was unusual to both
the Space Task Group and to many of his professional colleagues. It reversed the
common procedure of beginning with parts analysis and proceeding to the whole
system. Golovin had recently explained his theoretical point of view before the
American Society for Quality Control, citing other missile program precedents
for inverting the crucial problem: "start with a definition of failure for the
system, and then work back through subsystems and components to the data on
parts failures." Glennan and Horner had approved this approach as an aid to
fulfilling their desires for better "confidence coefficients" before accepting
the readiness of the capsule for unmanned and manned suborbital and three-orbit
missions. This kind of systems analysis used deduction and fully exploited
"numbers game" techniques and data processing machines to check on the inductive
systems engineering of STG and McDonnell. The experimentalists at the working
levels, and many of the engineering managers, including STG's Director, Robert
R. Gilruth, believed they saw a worthless expenditure of effort in this
innovation.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>NASA Headquarters saw STG dragging its feet on this issue by the end of June.
Glennan therefore tried another tack. He wrote directly to James S. McDonnell,
shortly after a personal visit and briefing at the factory:
<BLOCKQUOTE>As you know, during the last month there have been a number of
  discussions between my Office of Reliability and Systems Analysis and various
  members of your staff on the problem of Mercury capsule system reliability.
  These talks were the result of my having directed the Office of Reliability
  and Systems Analysis to prepare for me an objective quantitative evaluation of
  the anticipated mission and flight safety reliability of the Mercury capsule
  system. It has now been brought to my attention that discussions have not yet
  resulted in mutual agreement on getting this job seriously underway.
  <P>I would appreciate it if you would give the matter your personal attention
  and have your staff responsively consider providing, as promptly as possible,
  the information detailed in the enclosed "Proposed Work Statements for
  McDonnell on Mercury Capsule System Reliability."
  <P>If you foresee any serious problems in this connection, I would appreciate
  your bringing them directly to my attention, and I will be glad to set up a
  meeting in Washington to reach a full meeting of minds.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>The
work statements enclosed in this letter, prepared by Golovin's assistants Landis
S. Gephart, William Wolman, and Catherine D. Hock, called for precisely defined
reliability definitions, assumptions, diagrams, equations, and estimates of each
[267] subsystem design, together with all available test data from every source.
The basic reasons for requesting this information were to allow NASA "to review
and evaluate the techniques and the data employed by McDonnell" in its
reliability report (No. 7007) issued almost a year earlier, and "to update and
upgrade the reliability predictions and probability equations" for mission
success in the light of uneven changes of component parts supplied to McDonnell:
<BLOCKQUOTE>With all its subcontractors, McDonnell has established a
  reliability requirement for each major equipment. This requirement has been
  expressed either as a mean time between failures for a continuously operating
  device or as a probability of success for a single shot device, and has been
  incorporated as a firm contractual requirement in the appropriate McDonnell
  Specification Control Drawing. McDonnell also recognizes that "a requirement
  without a test to demonstrate compliance with it is meaningless." Accordingly,
  McDonnell has specified a variety of tests aimed at demonstration of the
  reliability requirements imposed on its subcontractors.</BLOCKQUOTE>Golovin and
associates wanted to examine all test plans and test results on every Mercury
capsule component from pre-installation acceptance through systems,
compatibility, qualification, and life tests. In short, they wanted virtually a
whole library of files at McDonnell opened for their inspection promptly, within
two weeks if possible. This was not quite possible, but the founder of McDonnell
Aircraft did reply personally to Administrator Glennan in mid-July:
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am happy to inform you that our company started work on 9 June
  1960, the same day on which Dr. William Wolman made his first specific
  request, even though this request was only verbal [sic]. Our company is now at
  work on every one of the programs therein outlined even though we still have
  no contractual authorization for any of it.
  <P>
  <P STYLE="text-align: center; word-spacing: 3em">* * *</P>
  <P>We are in full accord with providing as fast as humanly possible (without
  diluting other Project Mercury effort) whatever work is desired by NASA to
  assist in the reliability evaluations of Project Mercury. . . .<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.11"><SUP>11</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>A
few days later Golovin's group, having requested Silverstein to show STG how
invidious was its prejudice against the "numbers game," journeyed down to
Langley Field and briefed the Task Group on how Headquarters proposed to raise
quality by quantitative methods. Reliability goals for each major capsule
system, progressive analyses, and periodic reviews, plus a new order of
simulated mission-testing stringency, were proposed and accepted by STG. Since
the last major reliability meeting at Headquarters on February 29, 1960, had
been so acrimonious, STG was surprised to find how little difference there now
appeared to be between Golovin's approach to reliability and its own. On July
21, Paul E. Purser logged this note for Gilruth: "Spent most of the day in the
meeting with Dr. Golovin, et al. They sounded fairly reasonable. If we had held
such a meeting several months ago, there would have been a lot less
misunderstanding."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>Shortly after this rapprochement, Horner resigned from NASA to go to
industry, [268] Golovin resigned later to join the President's Science Advisory
Committee staff, and Gephart and Hock obtained an expansion of the McDonnell
reliability contract to cover the astronaut's task description and performance
evaluation. Glennan meanwhile pressured Silverstein, who pressured Gilruth, to
do something formal about taking into account contemporary mathematical
techniques used in missile programs to enhance managerial confidence in
reliability, hence in readiness before a launch. Gilruth in turn gave the job to
John C. French, who proceeded to organize a "reliability and quality assurance
office" in the Space Task Group. There was special significance in the word
"assurance," because STG had by no means capitulated to the statistical approach
nor to the mathematicians' belief in the efficacy of reliability prediction.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
<P>Had the qualification flight tests actually started earlier, perhaps much of
the debate over what to expect from Mercury launches would have been obviated.
But while still standing on the threshold of the major flight test program after
almost two years of virtually simultaneous work on detailed design, engineering,
and manufacturing, the Mercury spacecraft developers had to talk out some of
these difficulties before they could call for a vote. Far more significant than
the formal reliability program in the long run were the test philosophy, test
programs, and the test work in "space chambers" that could more realistically
simulate the hot/cold vacuum of the exospheric environment.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
To move in that direction required a move toward the "spaceport" at Cape
Canaveral, Florida.

<H3>Moving to the Launch Site</H3>The imminent shift from development into the
operational phase of Mercury was reflected in several different ways. Military
and industrial relations at Cape Canaveral were undergoing rapid change as
management and launch facilities were partially modified to accommodate the
influx of a new team for manned space flight. Melvin N. Gough, the senior test
pilot who had established NASA's basis for operations at the Cape, departed for
a job with the Civil Aeronautics Board, and into his shoes stepped G. Merritt
Preston for STG and Kurt H. Debus for Marshall's launch operations, now also a
part of NASA. The Air Force also added more help for NASA support activities
under Colonel Asa B. Gibbs and J. W. Rosenberry. Overcrowded facilities and
overlapping checkout and launch schedules were causes for interminable official
dickering but not for any program delay. Project Mercury eventually acquired
Hangar S and launch complexes 56 for Mercury-Redstone and 14 for
Mercury-Atlas.<A href="notes.htm#n9.15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>Although the rank and file of the Space Task Group were barely aware of the
new liaison between NASA Headquarters and McDonnell reliability experts, the
quest for quality control at the working level was entering a new phase. In the
early summer of 1960, about 50 men from STG established residence in Florida.
John F. Yardley, along with about 80 McDonnell technicians, set up shop in
mobile-home trailers around Hangar S, in the industrial area within the fences
[269] of Cape Canaveral. By the end of the year the number of technicians
working on the capsules for preflight checkout at the Cape had grown to more
than 400, most of the increase made up by contract personnel.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
<P>At the McDonnell factory in St. Louis, peak employment on Mercury systems had
reached 880 in April 1960. After that, there was a gradual decline in Mercury
production workers as Yardley's field team increased to 120 by summer's end.
Because STG had called for the first four capsules from McDonnell's production
line before they were entirely finished, the maximum of 427 workers on the
factory floor in May 1960 declined with the buildup of preflight polishing
activities at the Cape. Yardley and his crews soon became the center of
attention for unofficial helpers and kibitzers from other organizations and
contractors, many of whom were glad to provide materials and tools that were
urgently needed and in short supply among McDonnell people at the Cape.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>Yardley, his assistants at the Cape - E. F. Peters and Robert L. Foster - and
other working engineers knew little about the separate reliability contract
between NASA Headquarters and McDonnell. Walter F. Burke, Logan T. MacMillan,
and the quality manager, N. E. Covinsky, did know that this extra business was
coming to their company through separate channels, but they and their production
engineers were so busy trying to make each capsule work properly that they too
could see little sense in the "numbers game." Each system and subsystem seemed
to have its own personality. But to guard against overemphasizing these
individual idiosyncrasies, capsule No. 10 was set aside as the standard test
article at McDonnell. As preflight checkouts at the Cape uncovered more and more
unique difficulties, the need for still more stringent quality control was made
plain.
<P>No one recognized this more than Yardley, who in the summer of 1960 urged his
company to institute a new order of reliability tests. He did not insist on
statistical performance data, but he did enjoin improvement of
environmental-chamber reliability testing of components. Robert L. Seat,
McDonnell's senior test engineer, was pressed by Silverstein in Washington, by
Lewis R. Fisher of STG, and by Yardley from the Cape, as well as by the
burgeoning number of test requests between McDonnell departments, to prepare
specifications for an exhaustive environmental reliability testing program. On
September 26, 1960, the project to flight-test a man in orbit was supplemented
by an authorization to ground-test the capsule in a simulated mission through
physical environments in a "space chamber." This simulated orbital test program
gradually became known as "Project Orbit."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>The reaction control system on capsule No. 2 was giving Yardley headaches. In
general the power and sequential systems on all capsules were full of
"glitches," or minute transient voltages from inexplicable origins. Surely more
problems could be expected from space operations. So the simulated mission test
program, designed specifically to detect unknown anomalies arising from four and
a half hours of continuous operation in a vacuum alternately hot and cold, like
"day" and "night" for the manned satellite, was welcomed by all hands. [270]
Unfortunately it would take six months to build, install, test, and modify the
new space chamber test facility at the McDonnell plant. Several smaller, less
sophisticated "man-rating" vacuum chambers had already been used but none was
capable of simulating the extremes of orbital conditions.
<P>Prelaunch preparations at the launch site began in June 1960 with an
understanding between STG and McDonnell that some rework would be performed
there in addition to extravagant preflight checkout tests, but the extent of the
last-minute work to be performed and the number of discrepancies to be corrected
became so great that "preflight checkout" quickly came to be a misnomer. Under
Preston at the Cape, John J. Williams eventually came to head the "Preflight
Operations" division, instead of being simply "checkout" crew chief. Paul C.
Donnelly, Archibald E. Morse, Jr., A. Martin Eiband, Walter J. Kapryan, and
Jacob C. Moser gradually became involved with wholesale systems engineering as
the thoroughgoing checkouts in Hangar S expanded.
<P>Gilruth laid down the law "for what is perhaps the most important single
requirement in our programs: that designs, procedures, and schedules must have
the flexibility to absorb a steady stream of change generated by a continually
increasing understanding of space problems." This policy of correcting every
discovered deficiency and of modifying each spacecraft down to the finish line
at launch time was what Gilruth meant by an "R and D" program; it sacrificed
cost and schedules if necessary in the interest of quality or reliability as the
experimentalists understood it.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>Through August 1960 "space chamber" ground testing for Mercury had consisted
primarily of the capsule systems tests for integration and compatibility in a
relatively mild vacuum and of the manned environmental control system tests
simulating an altitude of 40,000 feet. McDonnell had detected many design
deficiencies in these test programs. Now early development failures, arising
from unanticipated interactions between parts and components and from errors in
estimating the effects of environmental extremes, became most troublesome.
<P>At St. Louis in mid-August, the "Development Engineering Inspection," a
milestone meeting comparable to the Mockup Review, brought together for three
days all the chief actors and participants in the hardware work on the capsule.
Walter C. Williams and Kenneth S. Kleinknecht were eager to institute this old
Air Force custom - the "D.E.I.," as they called it - as a basic check on systems
integration and configuration control. When on August 18 the 30 members of the
NASA inspection team departed, they were well assured that the Mercury capsule
on display (No. 7) was safe for manned flight, but only for a suborbital
mission. Orbital flight would require a higher order of precautions for
reliability. "Project Orbit," taking advantage of recent advances in vacuum
technology, promised to pioneer this new dimension in development engineering by
bringing the space climate down to Earth. Capsule No. 10 was specifically set
aside in September for environmental chamber testing at McDonnell for orbital
conditions.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>[271] While the Tenney Engineering Company of Union, New Jersey, was building
the new vacuum chamber for man-rated environmental testing of the capsule at the
Cape, and while McDonnell engineers were moving in to augment STG's preflight
checkout group there, one NASA operations expert transferred back to tidewater
Virginia to help Gilruth and French formulate policy and establish STG's
competence to judge reliability and flight safety issues. F. John Bailey, Jr.,
was Gilruth's choice for the man most likely to reconcile the differences
between reliability based on experience and on expertise. Bailey believed an
engineer needed 15 or 20 years' experience in any specialty to be a proper judge
of the state of his art; he also appreciated the value of mathematical models in
the redesign stages of technological evolution. But he quickly became convinced,
particularly by studying the carefully balanced engineering compromises between
efforts to make the boosters perfect and to perfect the escape system, that
Mercury dependability could hardly be improved except by flight testing.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>Everyone recognized dangers in the pragmatic experimental approach to
pilotless spacecraft research, but each calculated the risks differently.
Silverstein and the new Associate Administrator, Robert C. Seamans, Jr., who
succeeded Horner at this post on September 1, 1960, were among those at
Headquarters who justly feared that overemphasis on the uniqueness of each
production capsule and on STG's policy of continuous rework might lead to so
many "quick fixes" that a pyramid of unobtrusive changes could cover up the
truth about whatever might go wrong.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
<P>Perhaps the most pertinent of these difficulties with systems integration
derived from NASA bench tests of the reaction control system. The manufacturer
of the RCS, Bell Aerosystems Company, ran its qualification test program from
August through October 1960 and reported all phases of the testing
satisfactorily completed. Subsequent tests by McDonnell, STG, other NASA
engineers, the preflight teams at the Cape, and eventually by the workers on
Project Orbit revealed innumerable electrochemical and electromechanical
problems in simulated environments that required small changes here and there
and eventually everywhere. The thrust chambers, metering orifices, solenoid
valves, expulsion bladder, and relief valves each presented developmental flaws
that were "solved" more often by improvisations than by scientific redesign.
Karl F. Greil, a thermodynamicist who was working for Grand Central Rocket
Company in 1960 to perfect the escape pyrotechnology for Mercury, joined STG and
its reaction controls test team in 1961 and tried in vain to apply the same
perfectionistic standards to this vastly more complicated and inherently less
reliable system of moving parts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is the irony: the results that counted in Mercury's RCS were
  due to changes of the screen, heat barrier, and orifices, all of which were
  made upon simple first thought. On the other hand, the large amount of
  experimentation on the valve resulted merely in the assurance that nothing
  needed to be changed so far as valve design was concerned. This irony, that
  the simple approach [272] did the entire job while the sophisticated approach
  merely resulted in an "Amen", is indeed worthy of reflection, because it has
  in store both a risk and a lesson: a lesson because there is so much glamor
  cast on sophisticated pretense and so much disregard for the profane causes of
  all kinds of trouble; a risk because the simple remedy which did the job once
  without ever having become clear just how it really worked, such success
  without perspiration is likely to remain confined to its own historical case.
  But having established a precedent, it is bound to seduce us into relying on
  it, if it is not even bound to become a myth and a dogma.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.23"><SUP>23</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
Fortunately
neither the reaction system nor the environmental control system for the Mercury
suborbital flight had to be so nearly perfected as the escape, structural, and
landing systems. The development engineering inspection confirmed the faith of
most project engineers, in spite of a spate of impatient criticism from
outsiders, that capsule sequencing, electrical, communications, stabilization,
environment, pyrotechnical, instrumentation, and landing and recovery systems
were virtually ready to fly. McDonnell issued a revised set of detail
specifications for capsule No. 7 soon afterward. The Aerospace Corporation,
spawned from and now replacing Space Technology Laboratories (STL) for Air Force
systems engineering activities, published in September its basic planning
document, the "General Flight Plan: Atlas Boosters for Project Mercury."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
<P>If Project Mercury were on the verge of technological bankruptcy, as some
critics claimed, the problem was that man was still land-locked by inadequate
boosters. The Redstone for Mercury was still not man-rated. The first
Mercury-Atlas flight on July 29, 1960, not only did not qualify anything, it
seemed actually to have disqualified an indispensable part of Mercury. It cast
everything into doubt.

<H3>Atlas-Mercury One: A Complete Failure</H3>Late in February 1960 the Air
Force Ballistic Missile Division (BMD) and Space Technology Laboratories (STL)
had been hosts for a meeting in Los Angeles of people from Convair/Astronautics,
McDonnell, and the Task Group who were to determine the final details of the
ultimate booster-capsule system for Project Mercury. Already STG had decided
unilaterally, as was its prerogative, to make the next shot split the difference
between the Big Joe development mission and a full qualification flight test of
the Mercury-Atlas configuration on a simulated reentry from orbit. To the Task
Group, this configuration and mission had long since been known as "MA-1," but
Air Force and Convair engineers usually transposed the names and spoke of
"Atlas-Mercury" No. 1. As in many other particulars, which things should be
first still was debatable. Maxime A. Faget recorded his impression of the
central technical debate at the Mercury-Atlas meeting on February 26:
<BLOCKQUOTE>STL/CVA representatives made an impassioned plea to use the escape
  tower on the MA-1 shot. Only with the escape tower on, can the Atlas people
  [273] determine the structural bending modes on the Atlas and, consequently,
  the adequacy of their control system to accommodate them. The writer explained
  that the tower was deleted from this flight only after a great deal of
  deliberation at the Space Task Group, that much water has gone over the dam
  since then, and to change now would be very difficult. Although I agreed to
  take back to the Space Task Group management their desires for further
  consideration, they were informed that there was virtually no chance that the
  change would be made.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.25"><SUP>25</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>As
the MA-1 launch date approached, the Langley outfitters of the Big Joe capsule
installed inside the shell of McDonnell's capsule No. 4 another instrumentation
package, built by Lewis Research Center and STG electronics technicians. Shipped
to the Cape in mid-May, loaded with 200 pounds of sensing instruments -
including two cameras, two tape recorders, and a 16-channel telemetry system -
the MA-1 payload was equipped to measure some 50 temperatures (mostly on the
afterbody); pitch, yaw, and roll rates; positive and negative accelerations;
cabin and external pressures; and noise and vibration extremes. Besides the
missing 1060-pound escape system, this payload also lacked the environmental
control system, the astronaut couch and control panel, and the attitude-control
and stabilization-control jets. An inert paste replaced the solid fuel in the
retrorockets. For several months before the Atlas 50-D booster arrived at the
Cape, Joseph M. Bobik, of the STG Launch Operations Branch, had work abundant as
the inspector of the MA-1 capsule. Meanwhile Sigurd A. Sjoberg, John D. Hodge,
Richard G. Arbic, John P. Mayer, and Robert E. McKann were hastily revising the
mission directive, data acquisition plan, and general information on recovery
requirements, landing area predictions, and a summary of calculated preflight
trajectory data.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
Robert F. Thompson, Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., and Charles W. Mathews listed in
order of importance the test objectives of the MA-1 flight:
<OL>
  <LI>Recover the capsule.
  <LI>Determine the structural integrity of the Mercury capsule structure and
  afterbody shingles under the maximum heating conditions which could be
  encountered from an orbital launching.
  <LI>Determine Mercury capsule afterbody heating rates during reentry (for this
  purpose 51 thermocouples were installed).
  <LI>Determine the flight dynamic characteristics of the Mercury capsule during
  reentry.
  <LI>Determine the adequacy of the Mercury capsule recovery systems.
  <LI>Familiarize Project Mercury operating personnel with launch and recovery
  operations.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.27"><SUP>27</SUP></A></LI></OL>When
capsule No. 4 actually arrived at Cape Canaveral on May 23, it was as complete
as it was supposed to be except for flight instrumentation, parachutes, and
pyrotechnic devices. Following a satisfactory test of the leakage rate of its
[274] pressure shell, the capsule's miles of wiring were verified while the
instrumentation system was subjected to final bench tests. Minor difficulties
with instruments and in using a new weight-and-balance fixture added two weeks
to the work period. For integrated systems tests to verify the sequencing and
monitoring during the reentry, the capsule was moved into the newly constructed
clean room in Hangar S.
<P>When every minor discrepancy had been corrected and the calibration curves
for various units had been established, the spacecraft was moved out to launch
complex 14 for the first mechanical mating of a Mercury capsule with an Atlas
booster. The alignment was good; no rework was required for the umbilicals or
for the complex wiring in blockhouse consoles. But mechanical problems with
Freon lines and with some electrical contacts in the mating ring caused a delay.
Taken back to Hangar S for dismantling to rework certain instrumentation and
telemetry packages, the capsule again was transported to the pad and mated to
the launch vehicle in preparation for the flight acceptance composite test,
known by its acronym, FACT. From July 13 to 18 engineers stood on the bascule of
the gantry, working to conclude the FACT satisfactorily.
<P>Meanwhile the Atlas crews were checking out their vehicle. Friendly rivalry
between the propulsion and payload people produced many wagers over which system
would cause the next postponement, and whether the capsule or the booster would
be first to report "all systems go." On July 21, the flight readiness firing,
which was a dress-rehearsal static-firing test, tested the three Atlas engines
and measured the vibrations and acceleration strains suffered by the capsule.
Atlas partisans won a bet at this point; atop this particular capsule the short
metal legs of the "stub tower" created some unique antenna and telemetry
difficulties with power amplifiers, commutators, and a high voltage standing
wave ratio. The purpose of the "stub tower" was to support a thermal fairing
over the antenna and parachute canister. Again the spacecraft was returned to
the hangar. The tape recorders and cameras were removed, reloaded, and
reinstalled. The telemetry was checked. The recovery section equipment was
removed, then reassembled with live pyrotechnics. The capsule again was
balanced, weighed, and aligned optically before its final union with the
booster.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>McDonnell's virgin spacecraft No. 4 moved to the seaside launch pad dressed
in a polyethylene raincoat on July 24. This time it nestled nicely on top the
Atlas, and the umbilical insertion and pull tests shortly certified readiness to
begin the countdown. Wet weather made it difficult to keep the pyrotechnic
connections dry, but otherwise preflight checkouts were completed on July 26,
1960. For the benefit of Administrator Glennan, George Low summarized the
expectations for Mercury-Atlas 1:<A
href="notes.htm#n9.29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The primary objective of this test is to determine the integrity
  of the Mercury capsule structure and afterbody shingles when subjected to the
  maximum heating conditions which could be encountered in any Mercury mission.
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Maximum velocity: 19,000 feet per second
    <LI>Maximum altitude: 98 nautical miles
    <LI>Range: 1300 nautical miles
    <LI>Peak deceleration: 16.3 g
    <LI>Time of flight: 16 minutes</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>[275] Heavy rain pelted the
Cape early on Friday morning, July 29, 1960, but the cloud ceiling rose high
enough to be considered acceptable for a launching. During the final 35 minutes
of countdown before launch time (T), 48 minutes were accumulated by delays or
"holds" because of bad weather; liquid oxygen tank-topping delays; and telemetry
receiver difficulties. In the blockhouse Gilruth and Walter Burke watched Walter
Williams direct operations and Aleck C. Bond, the project engineer, sweat away
the minutes, while across the Cape at Central Control, other Air Force, Navy,
and Convair officers and officials also watched and waited. Before their
consoles in the blockhouse sat the Convair test conductors Kurt Johnston and
William Williams; Scott H. Simpkinson, the payload test conductor; Harold G.
Johnston, the ground instrumentation coordinator; Jacob Moser, the
instrumentation engineer; B. Porter Brown, the launch coordinator; Richard
Arbic, the range coordinator; and Donald C. Cheatham, the recovery coordinator.
At 7:25 the weather looked cooperative in the impact area, where recovery
aircraft and ships were reporting a visibility of five miles and a sea state of
mild swells. So the gantry was ordered to back away, leaving MA-1 poised alone
in the rain, ready for the final count. Intermittent holds for minor status
checks left only 7 minutes of count at 9 o'clock.
<P>Finally at 9:13 the man-made thunder clapped as the Rocketdyne engines spewed
forth their reaction energy. The noise grew louder for several seconds as the
Atlas pushed itself up on its fiery blast by inches, feet, and yards. Out of
sight in seconds as it pierced the cloud cover, Atlas 50-D could still be heard
roaring off in the distance. The initial phases of the launching appeared to be
normal. Then everything went wrong:
<BLOCKQUOTE>About one minute after liftoff all contact with the Atlas was
  lost. This included telemetry and all beacons and transponders. About one
  second before telemetry was lost, the pressure difference between the lox and
  fuel tanks suddenly went to zero. It is not known whether this caused the
  failure or was an effect of the failure. There was no progression of unusual
  events leading up to this pressure loss. During the remaining second of
  telemetry, the Atlas flight path appeared to be steady.</BLOCKQUOTE>By telephone
and teletype data links, Low in Washington pieced together the bad news on MA-1
and continued to dictate an immediate preliminary report for the administrator
and his staff:
<BLOCKQUOTE>As you know, the abort sensing system was flown open loop in this
  test. This system gave two signals to abort, apparently about the same time as
  the tank pressure differential was lost. These signals were monitoring missile
  electrical power and thrust; although the tank pressure differential was also
  monitored, no abort signal was received from this source. In the MA-1 mission,
  all of these signals were merely monitored, and were not connected to any of
  the capsule systems.
  <P>[276] The current speculation is that the Atlas either exploded, or
  suffered a catastrophic structural failure. Some observers reported that they
  heard an explosion, but this is not verified. The failure occurred at the time
  of maximum dynamic pressure, at an altitude of about 32,000 feet, and a
  velocity of about 1400 feet per second.
  <P>The capsule separation systems were not to be armed until about three
  minutes after launch, and therefore the capsule remained attached to the Atlas
  or to pieces of the Atlas, until impact. Capsule telemetry continued to impact
  and indicated violent motions after the Atlas telemetry ceased. Temperatures
  and shingle vibrations flutter were recorded. Since all shingle thermocouples
  gave readings to splash, it is inferred that none of the shingles tore off.
  Impact occurred about seven miles off shore in an area where the water depth
  is roughly 40 feet. At the time of this writing, ships were still searching
  for debris.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.30"><SUP>30</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>It
was a sad day for Mercury. It was especially frustrating for those nearest to
the Atlas-Mercury phase, for they knew only that MA-1, either Atlas 50-D or
capsule No. 4, or both, exploded on its way through max q. They did not know
precisely what had happened because the weather had been so bad as to prevent
visual and photographic coverage. In Washington, at Langley, at the Cape, and in
southern California, postmortems were held for two weeks, until a conference on
August 11 marshalled the parties most interested in the MA-1 malfunction, along
with all the flight records, telemetry, and tape recorder data. Salvage
operations had been able to recover only small portions of the capsule, the
adapter-ring, and the booster. Presiding at this meeting was Major General
Leighton I. Davis, the new commander of the Air Force Missile Test Center, who
had relieved Major General Donald N. Yates in June as the Department of Defense
single-point-of-contact for support of Project Mercury. On August 22, Warren J.
North summarized the "quick-look" opinions of NASA and STL but not of
Convair/Astronautics:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Both the NASA and STG localized the difficulty within the
  interface area between the capsule and the booster. A metallurgist from STL
  explained that it appeared the plumbing to the Atlas lox boiloff valve had
  failed due to fatigue. One would not ordinarily suspect a fatigue failure
  after such a short period of time, however, the NASA analysis showed that the
  lox valve plumbing could have failed if a 30 g oscillation existed at
  approximately 300 cycles per second. Culbertson (Convair) admitted that the
  lox valve was poorly supported and that 30 g was a feasible magnitude of
  acceleration. Vibration measurements show a two and one-half g vibration of
  the booster airframe, consequently a 12 g amplification factor would have been
  required at the lox valve.
  <P>Jim Chamberlin, STG, has been appointed chairman of a joint committee to
  resolve the MA-1 incident and provide a fix prior to MA-2. Initial reaction of
  this committee would cause the establishment of a hardware mockup at McDonnell
  which would include the pressurized lox tank dome, lox valve, adapter, and
  capsule. This mockup will be vibrated in order to isolate resonance or
  amplification factors.<A

but led to vastly improved interface between spacecraft and booster.</I></P>

<P>[278]
Two weeks later in San Diego, another committee of nine metallurgical engineers,
a majority of whom were not from Convair, examined microscopically the
hypothesis that MA-1 was destroyed by metal fatigue of the lox-vent valve elbow.
"All conferees agreed finally that the factor at hand was not the primary
one."<A

The official flight test report issued two months later concluded with these
remarks:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Mercury Atlas No. 1 flight test was abruptly terminated
  approximately 58.5 seconds after launch by an in-flight failure of an
  undetermined nature. Solid cloud cover at the time of launch precluded the use
  of optical records in the investigation of this failure. The following
  conclusions are drawn regarding this flight test:
  <P>
  <OL class="abc">
    <LI>None of the primary capsule test objectives were met.
    <LI>The structural integrity of the capsule was maintained throughout the
    flight until impact with the water. A substantial part of the adapter
    remained attached to the capsule to impact.
    <LI>The capsule onboard instrumentation performed in a highly satisfactory
    manner throughout the flight.
    <LI>The onboard instrumentation showed the presence of shingle vibration of
    a non-destructive nature.
    <LI>All Department of Defense support for the operation was very good.<A
    href="notes.htm#n9.33"><SUP>33</SUP></A></LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>In
mid-September one of the most important of the regular monthly meetings of the
Mercury-Atlas coordination panel took place in the administration building at
Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Brundin, Major
Charles L. Gandy, and Captain I. B. Hanson were the BMD representatives, while
Philip E. Culbertson and C. J. Holden represented Convair. Bernard A. Hohmann
and Ernst R. Letsch were representing Aerospace Corporation, since STL was
phasing out of Mercury. John Yardley, R. L. Foster, and J. T. Heard were present
for McDonnell.
<P>First and last on the agenda of this meeting were questions concerning better
ways of inspecting and solving problems at the interface between the capsule and
the booster. Charles Mathews, the chairman, began the meeting by insisting that
in spite of the MA-1 failure, the overall Mercury-Atlas schedule could still be
maintained. Hohmann suggested that a new seven-man joint capsule-booster
interface inspection committee be established. This was done, and members
representing all contributing organizations were named. Regarding the unsettled
question of MA-1, Mathews briefly described several fruitless fact-finding
activities and the need for additional instrumentation to determine the cause of
failures like MA-1. No new hypothesis had yet emerged from the several test
programs, so the 23 members of this coordination panel reexamined each other's
previous answers to the enigma of MA-1. The 11 members from STG vetoed a
proposal by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division to establish still another
"Mercury-Atlas interface panel."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
<P>Although the MA-1 investigation was unsatisfying, the launch operations
committee reported that MA-2 was so nearly ready for a November launching that
[279] there was little time for looking backward and no time for regret. Then on
September 26, 1960, a lunar probe attempt by NASA, using Atlas-Able 5-A, also
failed severely. This forced a wholesale review of the Atlas as a launch
vehicle. Everybody responsible for MA-1 was trying to determine the cause of
that failure, but each only discovered that there were too many other bodies,
both organic and organizational, partly responsible.
<P>Late in October, before the national elections and before another Mercury
flight test had come to pass, Gilruth and Williams held another periodic press
conference for the benefit of curious reporters. Inevitably the question was
asked, "Are you satisfied that you have pinpointed the reason for the MA-1
failure?" "No," Gilruth answered. "We successfully salvaged the capsule and can
account for all parts." His interrogator continued, "Do you believe that parts
in the Atlas' upper stage caused the failure?" Gilruth replied, "We have
explored this. We have answered all of the questions we have asked ourselves -
but have we asked the right questions? We can't be sure. That is one of the
reasons we are repeating the test. And on MA-2 the interface area will be
heavily instrumented."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
<P>When MA-2 finally became ready for launch, toward the end of February 1961,
the managers of Mercury knew that a repetition of a total failure like MA-1
could easily cause abandonment of the project. The entire promise of the
American manned space flight program seemed to hang in the balance. The
technical aftermath of MA-1, during the politically sensitive period of the
Presidential election and the lame-duck session of Congress, made interrelated
technical and political considerations more acute than ever. To distinguish
between the two soon became virtually impossible.

<H3>Election Year Appraisals</H3>The day that Mercury-Atlas 1 failed so badly,
NASA Headquarters announced plans to follow Project Mercury with a manned space
flight program called "Apollo" - a project conceived to carry three men either
in sustained orbital flight or on circumlunar flight. Several days later, the
X-15 set two new world records when NASA pilot Joseph A. Walker flew the manned
rocket on partial power to a speed of 2196 miles per hour and when Major Robert
M. White shot it up to a height of 136,000 feet over Nevada and California.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>In mid-August 1960, the Air Force accomplished two significant "firsts"
within eight days when it managed to recover instrumented packages from the
thirteenth and fourteenth attempts in its Thor-Agena-launched Discoverer series
of satellites. <I>Discoverer XIII</I> dropped its 85-pound capsule into the
Pacific off Hawaii on August 11 after 16 orbits; although a mid-air retrieval
had failed, frogmen and helicopters from a naval vessel found and returned this,
the first man-made object recovered intact from an orbital journey. On August
19, 1960, an Air Force C-119 cargo plane trailing a huge trapeze-like trawl
succeeded in being at exactly [280] the right place at the right time to snare
in mid-air the descending instruments from <I>Discoverer XIV.</I> That same day,
however, the Soviets launched an ark, including the "muttniks" Strelka and
Belka, and the next day they recovered the dogs and their live companions (rats,
mice, flies, plants, fungi, and seeds) after 18 orbits above Earth's atmosphere.
This marked the first successful recovery of living biological specimens from an
orbital voyage. Three months later, on November 14, 1960, another C-119 aircraft
succeeded in snatching the reentry capsule from <I>Discoverer XVII,</I> which
carried human tissue, bacteria, spores, and film emulsions to an orbital apogee
of 616 miles. For the moment, though, the Soviet achievement was overwhelming in
its portents for manned space flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
<P>On August 12, 1960, after an attempt that had failed in May, NASA's Project
Echo succeeded in placing into orbit the first passive communications satellite,
a 100-foot-diameter aluminized Mylar plastic balloon, which reflected radio
signals beyond Earth's curvature. Launched by a Thor-Delta vehicle into an orbit
roughly 1000 miles from Earth and inclined 47 degrees to the equator, <I>Echo
I</I> was the first artificial moon that could be seen easily with the naked eye
by all mankind. Although stargazing aborigines in neolithic cultures of New
Guinea and Mozambique probably could see the Echo balloon with the unaided eye
better than sophisticates in the smog and haze of urban-industrial centers from
California to Kazakhstan, the new pinpoint of light in the heavens was a visible
manifestation of the "space age." President Eisenhower's broadcast message
reflected from this sphere circling Earth at 15,000 miles per hour proclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is a great personal satisfaction to participate in this first
  experiment in communications involving the use of a satellite balloon known as
  Echo. This is one more significant step in the United States program of space
  research and exploration. The program is being carried forward vigorously by
  the United States for peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.
  <P>The satellite balloon which has reflected these words may be used freely by
  any nation for similar experiments in its own interests. Information necessary
  to prepare for such participation was widely distributed some weeks ago.
  <P>The United States will continue to make freely available to the world the
  scientific information acquired from this and other experiments in its program
  of space exploration.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.38"><SUP>38</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>While
the President was pointing to these and other achievements of the United States
in the exploration and use of outer space, the Nation was in the midst of a
highly contested presidential campaign and congressional elections. Four years
earlier it had seemed sheer whimsy, but now the practical values of space
exploration and policy decisions on space, missiles, and the Nation were being
not only examined but reexamined. In September, a month after Strelka and Belka
were orbited and recovered by the Soviet Union, Premier Khrushchev again came to
the United States for some personal diplomacy and figurative sabotage in the
United Nations General Assembly. Afterward he told reporters that his people
were ready to launch a man into space but had not yet made any such attempt.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
[281] No longer could Khrushchev's brogan braggadocio be ignored.
<P>Meeting at Barcelona, on October 7, 1960, the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration A&eacute;ronautique
Internationale adopted the first set of rules to govern the award of official
records for manned space flight. To be recognized under the "Code Sportif" that
had been setting the rules for aeronautical records since 1905, the first flight
into space must top at least 100 kilometers; later attempts to set records must
exceed the existing record by at least 10 percent. Four categories of
performance were set forth: duration of flight, altitude without orbiting Earth,
altitude in orbit, and mass lifted above 100 kilometers. To be valid, all claims
for records "must be supported by information on the date, time, place of
takeoff and landing, identity of the vehicle commander, and any special
apparatus used to assist liftoff, landing, or control."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>When in mid-October Soviet tracking ships deployed to stations in the
Pacific, an alert went out to American forces to expect imminent Soviet attempts
to fulfill Khrushchev's boast. In mid-August there had been much talk in the
American press that the United States had "rejoined" the space race as a result
of recent accomplishments. An Associated Press dispatch on August 8 reported
that Abe Silverstein was not particularly dismayed by the MA-1 fiasco and
believed that Project Mercury was "essentially along the same time schedule as
was initially planned." Congressman Overton Brooks, Democrat from Louisiana and
chairman of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, waxed much more
critical of the speed with which Project Mercury was moving. In September
Glennan warned Americans to be prepared for new Soviet announcements of space
spectaculars. The Mercury astronauts repeatedly were reported confident that one
of them could ride a ballistic trajectory either in December or January.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
In short, the dramatic race to be first to put a man in space made such colorful
copy that news editors generally ran stories on the space contest second only to
news about the political contest.
<P>The news media both reflected and fostered a widespread restlessness over the
apparent failure of American know-how to equal and surpass Soviet rocket
technology. Back in October 1959, two years after <I>Sputnik I,</I>
<I>Newsweek</I> had featured an article, "How to Lose the Space Race," itemizing
blanket criticisms of all American space programs. To ensure that you have the
losing ticket, advised <I>Newsweek,</I> simply "start late, downgrade Russian
feats, fragment authority, pinch pennies, think small, shirk decisions."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
At the beginning of 1960, Hanson W. Baldwin, the influential military affairs
correspondent for the <I>New York Times,</I> had chided the Eisenhower
administration for neglecting the power of intangible ideas and had advised the
government to seek more advice from political rather than physical scientists:
"It is not good enough to say that we have counted more free electrons in the
ionosphere than the Russians have . . . we must achieve the obvious and the
spectacular, as well as the erudite and the obscure." And in July 1960 one of
the deans of space fiction and fact, Arthur C. Clarke, published a [282]
playful, widely viewed article that suggested that the United States had
"already suffered a failure of nerve" and forfeited its future by failing to
"rocket to the renaissance."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>Project Mercury specifically, as 1960 wore on without much to show for the
taxpayers' millions, began to be criticized more minutely. Perhaps the most
painful sting felt by the Mercury team came from adverse publicity in
<I>Missiles and Rockets,</I> a weekly defense industry trade journal, on August
15, 1960. There, under the heading "Is Mercury Program Headed for Disaster?"
writer James Barr excoriated Project Mercury:
<BLOCKQUOTE>NASA's Mercury manned-satellite program appears to be plummeting
  the United States toward a new humiliating disaster in the East-West space
  race.
  <P>This is the stark conclusion that looms in the minds of a growing number of
  eminent rocket scientists and engineers as the Mercury program continues to
  slip backward.
  <P>These experts, many of whom are already calling Mercury a latter day
  Vanguard, contend:
  <P>The program today is more than one year behind its original schedule and is
  expected to slip to two. Therefore, it no longer offers any realistic hope of
  beating Russia in launching the first man into orbit around the earth - much
  less serve as an early stepping stone for reaching the moon.
  <P>Despite precautions and improvements, Mercury continues to be a technically
  marginal program that could easily end in flaming tragedy. Mercury, at best,
  is a technical stop-gap justifiable only as an expedient. It is no substitute
  for what is needed sooner or later, a maneuverable spacecraft similar to the
  Air Force's much hampered Dyna-Soar.
  <P>Mercury originally had the supposed advantage of being cheap, an attribute
  that made it particularly attractive to the Administration. However, Mercury
  has proven to be a trip down a dead-end road that U.S. taxpayers are finding
  themselves paving in gold. Appropriations have reached a quarter-billion to
  date. They may double.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.44"><SUP>44</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Although
Barr's animadversion could have been discounted in an election year as a plug
for more encouragement and funding to the Air Force's Dyna-Soar program, the
occasions for self-doubt inside Project Mercury indisputably were becoming more
numerous. On September 16, 1960, Gilruth issued a memorandum for his staff that
showed the effects of barbs like those from Barr on the morale of the Task
Group. The subject of the memo was "Favorable Press Comments (for a change)":
<BLOCKQUOTE>As most of you know, there have been some adverse comments in the
  press and trade publications about the progress, or lack of progress, being
  made in Project Mercury during recent weeks. A number of members of the Space
  Task Group have expressed concern about these articles.
  <P>In any program as broad and complex and as important to our national
  stature as Project Mercury, it is inevitable that there will be people around
  us who either will not agree with us, period, or who tend to disagree in one
  element or another just to be disagreeable. At the same time, there are a
  number of people around our country who do understand how much work and how
  much blood and sweat go into an undertaking of this kind.
  <P>
  <P STYLE="text-align: center; word-spacing: 3em">* * *</P>
  <P>[283] I am personally confident that the work that all of you are doing
  will bear fruit in the near future. In the interim, I urge all of you to put
  on your thickest hide, to continue your concerted efforts to make Project
  Mercury the kind of program it was designed to be, and to reflect with me upon
  our past accomplishments.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.45"><SUP>45</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>At
NASA Headquarters there was serious concern over how to answer public
criticisms. On August 14 Warren North sent the Administrator some arguments
filling in the contextual background of Mercury schedules:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since the negotiation of the capsule contract, McDonnell personnel
  have averaged 14% overtime for an equivalent 56 hour week. McDonnell has
  assigned approximately 13,000 people in direct support of Project Mercury. In
  October 1959, production went on a 7-day week, three shifts per day. Since
  January 1960 capsule checkout personnel have worked three shifts per day seven
  days per week. McDonnell is also working three shifts at Cape Canaveral.
  During the past eighteen months, Space Task Group personnel have been using
  less than half their annual leave. Many have used essentially no annual leave
  since February 1959. Space Task Group personnel at Cape Canaveral worked
  approximately 50 hours a week preparing for flight operations. When the MA-1
  capsule was delivered to the Cape on May 23, 1960, this group went on a
  60-hour week. During the final month of MA-1 preparations, the launch
  operations crew was working a seventy-hour week. The forthcoming simultaneous
  operations with Atlas and Redstone will require a continuation of this type of
  effort.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>On
September 9, 1960, George Low addressed a United Press International editors
conference at a hotel in Washington on the subject of the progress made in
Project Mercury to date. Low began by arguing against three common
misconceptions about the project in the public press: Mercury was not, he said,
"merely a stunt," not "designed only to win an important first in the space
program," and should not "be terminated if the Soviets achieve manned orbital
flight before we do." Firmly convinced that the Soviets now had the capability
of achieving manned orbital flight, Low tried to persuade the opinion molders of
the "fourth estate" to accept Mercury as an indispensable step toward Project
Apollo, one which "must be carried out regardless of Russian achievement." This
theme subsequently became official NASA policy. The urgency of Project Mercury
was transferred onto the higher level of the urgency of manned space flight in
general and for the future. "It has been a major engineering task," said Low,
"to design a capsule that is small enough to do the mission, light enough to do

<P>Within the aerospace community of industrialists, technicians, and Government
scientists and engineers, the context described by North and Low needed little
explication. Experience with federally sponsored "R and D" programs since 1940
helped them understand the difference between a project rating the "DX," or
highest industrial procurement priority, and one designated an all-out "crash"
program. Mercury was never a "crash" project in the sense that the Atlas ICBM
[284] or the Manhattan Project had been, in which duplicative and parallel
solutions were developed for its most difficult systems. The DX priority for
materials, NASA's own first rating, and STG's high "sense of urgency" were
tempered always by the rule of noninterference with priority defense programs.
In mid-September NASA and the Defense Department agreed to aid each other to
avoid duplication and waste by means of a new Aeronautics and Astronautics
Coordinating Board, with Dryden and Herbert F. York as co-chairmen.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>But the citizenry, through the press, saw these problems in simpler terms.
"Project Mercury: Race or Pure Science?" was a banner headline in a Norfolk
newspaper of September 11. Richard M. Mansfield related therein how the United
States "space fever" had fluctuated over the previous three years:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gilruth gets a little angry when people talk about Mercury lagging
  behind schedule. Some say it is behind as much as a year. Gilruth says this is
  pure nonsense, that no one can properly put a specific target date on a
  research program that explores "new frontiers," and is beset by such "detailed
  problems."
  <P>
  <P STYLE="text-align: center; word-spacing: 3em">* * *</P>
  <P>Gilruth gave assurance that extra money would not have cut time
  appreciably. He does not believe that a blank-check crash program would save
  much time even now.
  <P>"I think we've done our optimum," he said. "It's just like having a baby.
  Maybe (with more money) we could have had a lot more of them, but you wouldn't
  have cut the time on any one of them."<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.49"><SUP>49</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Reporter
Mansfield went on to summarize the conflicting attitudes of scientists who "are
never in a hurry," with Government employees, including scientists, who must
respond to the demand of the electorate to "overtake the Soviets." The eagerness
of the seven American astronauts to make their suborbital flights was tempered,
he reported, by their recognition that the orbital venture into space had
already slipped too far. "There is little doubt among them that the Russians
will have been there first," said Mansfield.
<P>Late in September members of the military and industrial community engaged in
aerospace and defense business watched with interest for indications where best
to invest their votes. The editors of <I>Missiles and Rockets</I> addressed an
open letter to both the Republican and the Democratic candidates for the
Presidency, inviting comments on a "modest proposal for survival." The journal
sought specific commitments on the recognition as national policy of the
strategic space race with Russia and on the endorsement of a bold long-range
program for space projects during the next decade. Candidate John F. Kennedy
responded immediately with his concurrence that "we are in a strategic space
race with the Russians, and we have been losing. . . . if a man orbits earth
this year his name will be Ivan." To this audience Kennedy also explained one
meaning of his campaign slogans on "moving ahead" into the "new frontier": "This
is the new age of exploration; space is our great new frontier." Vice-President
Richard M. Nixon, seeing the issues of an alleged "missile gap" and of national
prestige loom ever larger in the [285] later stages of the campaign, at last
replied by vigorously defending the record of the Eisenhower administration.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
The issue of manned space flight was never clearly joined, here or in the
television debates preceding the election. But after the first Tuesday in
November, even though the popular vote barely showed a preference, it was clear
that the next Chief Executive as well as the Congress would be Democratic and
that this meant change.
<P>Project Mercury, as one large and unproven part of NASA, could expect to be
influenced by "the gathering storm over space" and some sharp changes in the
Nation's defense and space programs.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
The most forthright change to be expected with the new administration likely
would be an honest and open admission of the competitive aspects of space
technology. International negotiations on disarmament had failed to produce any
further arms control measures since the 1958 Russian-American agreement to
suspend atmospheric nuclear testing. Efforts in the United Nations to exempt
space as an arena for international rivalries, following the example of the 1959
Antarctica treaty, had so far failed. It seemed purely sentimental to act as if
coexistence would become any less competitive. Besides, recent successes of
American missiles reinforced the United States' foreign policy of steadfast
resistance to Communist encroachments. An Atlas ICBM had again flown 9000 miles
for a bullseye in the Indian Ocean on September 19, 1960; the Thor was
operational, and the Polaris and Titan weapon systems were in active test
phases. A "booster gap" there admittedly was, but the "missile gap" appeared
closed, at least to discussion, after the election. The new President would
probably find it politic to move speedily but cautiously toward a more intensive
national (in contrast to a scientific-international) space program. Kennedy was
historically minded and could be trusted to see "the present in perspective,"
but whether he would consider, as one professional historian did, "manned space
flight as the main object of Russo-American rivalry" was entirely moot.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>Congressional attitudes before and after the election of 1960 seemed to
change less drastically because Congress was already Democratic and had been
critical of the Republican "no-race" thesis for three years now. Some of those
legislative representatives who felt a need to justify their loyal opposition to
Eisenhower and their support for manned space exploration could do so by mailing
their constituents a congressional staff report entitled "The Practical Values
of Space Exploration." Philip B. Yeager, a staff member of the House Committee
on Science and Astronautics, wrote this pamphlet "to explain to the taxpayer
just why so many of his dollars are going into the American effort to explore
space, and to indicate what he can expect in return which is of value to him."
Two editions of this report, before and after the election, began with a
quotation from a Russian workman who reportedly complained in a letter published
on the front page of <I>Pravda</I> for June 12, 1960:
<BLOCKQUOTE>What do Sputniks give to a person like me? . . . So much money is
  spent on Sputniks it makes people gasp. If there were no Sputniks the
  Government [286] could cut the cost of cloth for an overcoat in half and put a
  few electric flatirons in the stores. Rockets, rockets, rockets. Who needs
  them now?<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.53"><SUP>53</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Neither
edition of Yeager's staff report spoke explicitly about Project Mercury, but
both implicitly illustrated Mercury's motivation. The author delineated in lay
language five categories of values served by national space programs. Intangible
values came first and included scientific curiosity and the human urge to do as
well as to know. National security was second, and included the argument for
space rivalry as a substitute for war. Economic benefits, immediate and remote,
were described in social terms for the third category. "Values for everyday
living" described some of the technological and medical "fallout" or "spin-off"
from space-related research. And finally this pamphlet pointed to long-range
values and to possible interrelationships with the population explosion, water
shortages, soil erosion, new leisure time, and the scientific and spiritual
aspirations of humanity. In conclusion Yeager chose to quote a paragraph, from
an editorial in the magazine <I>Industrial Research,</I> which "sober study
indicates . . . may not be too 'far out' after all":
<BLOCKQUOTE>Space technology is probably the fastest moving, typically free
  enterprise and democratic industry yet created. It puts a premium not on
  salesmanship, but on what it needs most - intellectual production, the
  research payoff. Unlike any other existing industry, space functions on hope
  and future possibilities, conquest of real estate unseen, of near vacuum
  unexplored. At once it obliterates the economic reason for war, the threat of
  overpopulation, or cultural stagnation; it offers to replace guesswork with
  the scientific method for archeological, philosophical, and religious
  themes.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.54"><SUP>54</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Technical Sprint for Man in Space</H3>Although election year reexaminations
and premonitions of the Soviet Vostoks were disconcerting, these were the least
of the conscious worries of the men teamed in the technological harness to get a
Mercury astronaut off the ground. They still had a plenitude of more prosaic
problems of their own. The inexorable growth of the capsule weight, the marginal
performance of the Atlas as a launch vehicle, interface wiring and structural
problems, and the worrisome reaction and environmental controls for the capsule
were outstanding. On the other hand, some problems, like thermal protection
during atmospheric entry and the physiological effects of weightlessness for a
short period, were assumed solved for the moment.
<P>Benjamine J. Garland, one of Faget's fellow authors of the seminal 1958 NACA
paper for Mercury, prepared a special report for Gilruth on the probability of
damage to the capsule by micrometeoroids during an orbital flight. Garland
advised that the danger to the capsule during an orbital flight from sporadic
meteoroid activity was very small. He calculated probabilities of hits during a
major meteoroid shower and found the danger was "still small but . . . [287] an
order of magnitude greater than the danger due to the sporadic background. Since
the periods of activity of the major showers are known, it is possible to avoid
operations during these periods and would be advisable to do so."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
<P>Because qualification and reliability tests on the retrograde and posigrade
rocket systems proved disappointing in their later results, Gilruth's team
called for help from the Ames and Lewis Research Centers. Robert R. Nunemaker
led a group at Lewis, monitored by John B. Lee of STG, who found some serious
difficulties with retrorocket alignment and escape tower separation. Among other
things, they found that some igniters were faulty and that the jettisoning of
the escape tower under certain conditions might permit a smashing recontact.
<P>But the most serious problem with capsule systems at this time was the
outside chance that one or more of the three retrograde braking rockets might
fail. There was considerable margin for error in the design of the retropackage,
but there was no emergency braking system. STG's mission analysis group under
John P. Mayer had thoroughly investigated an inflatable balloon for this
purpose, and Gilruth himself proposed an emergency brake that would have looked
like a Chinese dragon kite trailing in the wake of the orbiting capsule. This
auxiliary drag device to back up the retrosystem and to bring the capsule down
sooner than in the 24 hours theoretically required for a normal decay of
Mercury's orbit was independently appraised by Howard K. Larson and others at
Ames. Meanwhile John Glenn and the other astronauts asked STG's mission analysts
to study the effectiveness of a "fish-tailing" maneuver as a backup reentry mode
of last resort. Both ideas were reported feasible, but the former was not
pursued past the end of the year, when the reliability of the retrorockets and
pyrotechnics began to rise appreciably.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
<P>Among the number of unsolved problems regarding man-machine integration in
late 1960, the complex final phase of the mission profile aroused much concern.
If an astronaut could survive launch, insertion, orbiting, reentry, and the
free-fall, nothing must jeopardize his chances to survive impact, exit from the
capsule, and recovery. But as the capsule developed into flight hardware, the
differences between its theoretical design and its measurable performance
required constant restudy, redesign, and in some cases redevelopment.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
While studying the Mercury capsule's stability in water, for example, Peter J.
Armitage and E. N. Harrin of STG found that the deletion of the flotation bags
and the addition of the impact skirts had seriously compromised the floating
trim if not the seaworthiness of the capsule.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
<P>After summarizing recent investigations by both McDonnell and STG engineers,
Armitage and Harrin pointed out a number of unknowns and recommended close
scrutiny of any changes to capsule center-of-gravity positions to keep the
capsule within acceptable stability limits. While the model-makers at Langley
were fabricating and testing 24 new impact skirts, Astronauts Shepard, Grissom,
and Schirra practiced getting out of the capsule; it now listed at severe angles
and sometimes even capsized.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
<P>[288] During September 1960 all the Mercury astronauts began to train more
pointedly for the Mercury-Redstone mission. Early in October they gathered their
personalized couches, pressure suits, and accessories for centrifuge runs at the
Navy's Aviation Medical Acceleration Laboratory at Johnsville,
Pennsylvania. Fitted with a production handcontroller assembly and environmental
control system, the gondola of the centrifuge whirled each man as if he were
experiencing the calculated acceleration profile of the MR-3 flight. At
Johnsville the astronauts gained experience in attitude and rate control,
monitored the normal sequencing functions, and learned to cope with emergency
conditions like overacceleration and decompression. Alan Shepard, for instance,
took 10 training "flights" during the October session.<A

<IMG height=422 alt="Events on MR flight" src="t289.gif" width=762>
<P class="caption"><I>Normal sequence of events for Mercury-Redstone
flight.</I></P>
</DIV>

<P>On September 8, 1960, Silverstein called to Washington NASA's and McDonnell's
chief engineers at work on Mercury to discuss plans for compressing the
Mercury-Redstone schedule by expediting the capsule systems tests and checkout
procedures for capsules Nos. 5 and 7, to be flown on MR-2 and MR-3,
respectively. Once again Silverstein asked that McDonnell assign independent
systems engineers to verify all hardware installations. Especially they were to
improve the quality of capsule No. 7 before the formal systems testing period.
This was done during October and November; for 43 days No. 7 underwent
performance trials of all its systems except its reaction controls, automatic
stabilization controls, and instrumentation and communications gear. McDonnell,
Navy, and STG liaison inspectors tried hard to meet Silverstein's Cape delivery
deadline of November 15, but two major discrepancies could not be allowed to
pass. One problem had been perennial: overheating DC/AC inverters.
Investigations disclosed that as long as the ambient temperature was kept below
165 degrees F they functioned properly. McDonnell attempted to cure this
overheating problem by replacing the honeycombed inverter sockets with aluminum
shelves that doubled as heat sinks.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
<P>The second problem was new: tiny cracks were noticed in the outer titanium
skin of the capsule pressure vessels. Samples of fractured material were sent to
the Battelle Memorial Institute, an endowed foundation for applied scientific
research, at Columbus, Ohio. Battelle found that the heated zones adjacent to
the seam welds contained an excessive amount of precipitated hydrides, compounds
of hydrogen and other elements. These impurities lowered the ductility of the
skin of the pressure vessel, increased leakage rates, and increased the danger
of structural collapse upon impact. But since capsule No. 7 had the best record
of all in the capsule systems tests, it passed muster to begin its final factory
shakedown tests on November 21, 1960. For later capsules, welding methods,
vibration testing, and microscopic inspections were improved, but the
long-standing "skin-cracking" problem required that the search be renewed for
ways to eliminate hydride formations near the beads of fusion welds.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
<P>On December 1, 1960, Jerome B. Hammack, the MR-3 project engineer for STG,
and his assistant, James T. Rose, certified that capsule No. 7 was ready for
[289] its manned mission, though some 20 days behind schedule. "The writers
would like to stress that the majority of time spent during this period was
spent on correction and rework rather than the actual CST and that every effort
should be made in the future to achieve manufacturing perfection prior to the
capsule entering CST."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile capsule No. 2, being readied for the first Mercury-Redstone flight,
was delivered to the Cape at the beginning of August. This flight, MR-1, was
then scheduled for launching early in October. Both McDonnell and STG preflight
checkout crews in Hangar S worked around the clock to make ready the maze of
systems in their capsule. Christopher Kraft talked over Mercury command
functions with the Redstone launch team under Debus and with Air Force range
safety officer Lieutenant Colonel R. D. Stephens early in September. They then
decided to fly the MR-1 mission with the automatic abort system in the open-loop
mode to lessen any possibility of a nuisance abort on this qualification flight.
<P>On a trial basis, a smaller Flight Safety Review Board for the spacecraft
(tailored after the Atlas boards by the same name), chaired by Walter Williams
and consisting of Astronaut Cooper, F. J. Bailey, Jr., Kenneth S. Kleinknecht,
and William M. Bland, Jr., was established at the Cape to pass final judgment
during the week before the countdown on the readiness of the mission. During the
first week in October, final preparations were made to launch MR-1, and on the
morning of October 9, 1960, an unbroken countdown proceeded to within 22 minutes
of launchtime before the shot was scrubbed because of a malfunction in the
capsule reaction control system.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>
<P>[290] By the first of November both LJ-5 and MR-1 appeared ready for
launching on November 7, 1960. But both launches had to be postponed again (the
day before the election) because of inclement weather at Wallops Island and
because at the Cape a serious leak developed in the helium tank of capsule No.
2. Without helium to pressurize the hydrogen peroxide thrusters, the payload
after posigrade release might not reorient itself properly for reentry. So heavy
had the workload at the Cape become that Williams decreed a maximum of 12 hours'
work for any one person in any one day.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.65"><SUP>65</SUP></A>
<P>The possible political significance of these launches now was seen by the
press and by the legislative staffs on Capitol Hill and at NASA Headquarters.
George Low's routine report for James P. Gleason, Assistant Administrator for
Congressional Relations, carefully explained the technical reasons first for
delay and then for speedup on the launch schedules. Regarding Little Joe 5,
Gleason informed the staff director of the Senate space committee that NASA
Headquarters was keeping close tabs on MR-1 scheduling information because of
the need to coordinate interagency activity, but that Little Joe missions
"requiring no major coordination with non-NASA organizations" had always been
handled on a less formal basis:
<BLOCKQUOTE>You will notice that the launch target date was delayed from
  October 8, 1960, to November 11, 1960, at the time when it became apparent
  that the capsule delivery would be delayed until about August 1, 1960. Between
  August 17 and August 31, a large number of checkout difficulties was
  encountered in the noise and vibration test program. It was then expected that
  the capsule would not arrive at Wallops until October 5, and hence the launch
  date was moved to November 16.
  <P>In the early part of September, the rate of progress at Langley picked up,
  and the capsule was actually shipped to Wallops on September 27th.
  Nevertheless, the projected launch date was not moved to an earlier date,
  since simultaneous experience with MR-1 at Cape Canaveral gave every
  indication that the prelaunch checkout would take longer than planned.
  <P>In actual practice, the Wallops Island checkout ran very smoothly.
  Accordingly, a new target date of November 7 was established late in October.
  Barring difficulties during the final checkout period, and assuming that the
  weather will be clear and calm, the launching will take place on that date.
  <P>. . . I feel that our project engineers have done an excellent job at
  predicting these dates; it is very seldom that actual dates on as complex a
  research and development program as this one have come out so close to the
  predicted dates as these have.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.66"><SUP>66</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Less
out of sensitivity to the political winds than because the facts seemed to
warrant it, the apolitical civil servants in the Task Group sent an encouraging
status report on Project Mercury to their administrative superiors in Washington
at the end of October 1960. There were a couple of negative items: the cause of
the MA-1 failure was still unknown, and the checkout time at the Cape for
capsule No. 2 for MR-1 was stretching interminably, it seemed. On the plus side,
three capsules (Nos. 2, 5, and 6 for MR-1, MR-2, and MA-2, respectively) were on
hand, and two more (Nos. 7 and 8 for MR-3 and MA-3) were expected [291] at the
Cape momentarily. The Mercury Control Center, a command-post building trisecting
the area between the two blockhouses beside the launching pads and the
industrial hangars, was open and almost ready for operations. Four preflight
checkout trailers supplied by McDonnell were already in full use. Procedures
Trainer No. 2 was being wired to its computer banks, and the ground-test
qualification program seemed almost complete.
<P>The tracking and communications network was essentially finished, except for
the stations at Kano, Nigeria, and on Zanzibar. The Atlas ASIS was looking good,
and with luck the first truly complete Mercury-Atlas configuration, MA-2, still
might possibly be flown during the quarter. Cost accounting for the program was
still a black art, but according to STG's own estimates the summary of funds
required to accomplish the Mercury mission as defined in October 1960 approached
$110 million:<A

<H3>Little Joe 5 Votes No</H3>On Election Day, November 8, 1960, Space Task
Group and McDonnell engineers at Wallops Island finally pulled the trigger on
capsule No. 3, attached to Little Joe 5. Having planned LJ-5 for over a year as
the first qualification flight of a production capsule to sustain abort
conditions at maximum dynamic pressure, the hard-working crews were especially
chagrined to see the disintegration of all their plans only 16 seconds after
liftoff. At that time the escape rocket and the tower jettison rocket both
prematurely ignited while the booster was still thrusting. Therefore booster,
capsule, and tower stayed mated together throughout their ballistic trajectory
until impact shattered them to fragments.
<P>Whether the limit switches at the clamp rings below or above the spacecraft
were at fault, or whatever improper rigging, wiring, or voltage regulation was
the cause, it was exceedingly hard to rationalize that something was learned
from this flight failure. Spacecraft and booster continued on their arc 10 miles
high and 13 miles out to sea before being mangled on impact 2 minutes later.
Salvage operations in water 72 feet deep recovered 60 percent of the booster but
only 40 percent of the capsule.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.68"><SUP>68</SUP></A>
Extensive tests on the clamp-ring problem were conducted on rocket sleds at the
Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California.
<P>For well over a year Holloman Air Force Base personnel, led by Major John D.
Mosely, [292] of the Aeromedical Field Laboratory, had prepared a packaged
payload with a medium-sized chimpanzee to ride the LJ-5 qualification flight. As
late as mid-July 1960, operational planning still included a first-order test
objective to determine the effects of a simulated Atlas abort acceleration on a
chimp. The delay in capsule delivery and a large number of checkout difficulties
encountered in late August, especially with the booster-capsule clamp rings and
pyrotechnics, led William Bland and Rodney G. Rose to persuade Gilruth to rule
out the primate on Little Joe 5. Besides that, the second Mercury-Redstone now
being groomed for a chimp flight represented a direct conflict in scheduling.
<P>As disappointing as this decision was to aeromedical personnel, including
James P. Henry, the physician who supervised the animal program for STG, the
managers of the Task Group felt they could not afford to risk further delays.
The structural integrity of McDonnell's Mercury capsule and the escape system
during that most critical time in the region of highest dynamic pressure had to
be demonstrated as soon as possible. By deliberately omitting the environmental
control system and its problems, the Task Group had hoped to concentrate on
hardware dynamics, taking extraordinary precautions "to minimize premature
firing of any of the capsule pyrotechnics on the launching pad."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.69"><SUP>69</SUP></A>
Obviously something - no one knew what - had been overlooked.
<P>After the dismal failure of Little Joe 5, these bleak days for Project
Mercury became even bleaker with the discovery that the helium leak in the
capsule for MR-1 could not be fixed quickly; it would require the replacement of
certain valves and the whole hydrogen peroxide tank. Furthermore a change in the
MR-1 wiring was dictated by the poor sequence and circuitry design on Little Joe
5. NASA had one more Little Joe test booster on hand. One more airframe, the
last one in existence, had recently been ordered as a backup to the next shot.
On November 10, NASA Headquarters was reassured that a stripped capsule on the
backup booster could fulfill the Little Joe 5 mission, "an essential one before
manned flight," probably before the end of January. And both Mercury-Redstone 2
and Mercury-Atlas 2 still were considered "not beyond the realm of possibility"
for launchings in December.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.70"><SUP>70</SUP></A>
<P>There was precious little in Mercury to be thankful for during the
Thanksgiving season of 1960, but there was more than enough work to keep
everyone in STG preoccupied. Caldwell C. Johnson wrote Faget a summary memo
concerning the capsule's weight growth and its effect upon Atlas performance and
mission profiles. While McDonnell was conducting extensive tests of the impact
skirt situation, Johnson and others were worried about whether it would ever
work. In the light of later developments, the ferment over redesign at this time
became significant, and Johnson's words grew in significance:
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have been monitoring Mercury weight growth, McDonnell's
  airplane-weight history and the X-15 weight versus development phase and
  conclude that Mercury orbit weight by the time of manned flight will exceed
  3000 pounds! Capsule weight during parachute opening mode will be 2600
  pounds; [293] flotation weight is practically as great. These increases have a
  detrimental effect upon orbital insertion probability, retrograde action,
  parachute opening loads, and water stability. The only single action that will
  cure the problem is weight reduction in the capsule but its weight growth is
  inexorable. It appears that several separate actions are necessary.
  <P>J. Mayer calculates that at 3000 pounds the probability of orbit insertion
  is less than 96 percent even when based upon certain Atlas performance
  increases. Furthermore, the possibility of an African landing from an early
  abort is very real. He says there are some reasons to believe that Atlas
  weight can be further reduced and greater payload capacity realized but so far
  this is but speculation, and, in any case, doesn't do much for the African
  landing situation.
  <P>Some time ago increased retrograde capability was proposed but could not be
  justified at that time. There is little doubt that such a change is justified
  now - the question is whether posigrade impulse should likewise be increased
  to aid orbit insertion. It is tempting to combine posigrade and retrograde
  systems and to utilize the propellant as required by the particular flight
  situation. But, this is a rather drastic change.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.71"><SUP>71</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>MR-1: The Four-Inch Flight</H3>November 21, 1960, marked the absolute nadir
of morale among all the men at work on Project Mercury. That was the day the
MR-1 countdown reached zero, and when "all we did was to launch the escape
tower."
<P>Capsule No. 2 had been checked out at Huntsville on July 21 and shipped to
the Cape the next day. The final standard trajectory was published on August 1,
and the Redstone booster was delivered two days later. From July 23, when the
capsule was airlifted to the Cape, until October 7, extensive internal reworking
was required. Since this was the first complete capsule to be subjected to
preflight checks, it was impossible to know precisely how long the checkout
would take. Gleason of NASA Headquarters had explained these scheduling
gymnastics to the Senate committee staff on November 3:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Between October 6 and October 31, 1960, the work proceeded
  exceedingly well. By October 24, for example, first mate had been completed.
  The rework had been accomplished and the simulated mission and servicing had
  been carried out. Not only had none of the contingency period been used up,
  but preparations were actually two days ahead of schedule! It was, therefore,
  hoped for the first time, that the working level target date might actually be
  met, assuming that some as yet unresolved electrical troubles would not cause
  any real delays.
  <P>On October 31, the final mating of the capsule and booster was
  accomplished. Still two days ahead of the target date established on October
  7. Therefore, it became clear, upon examination of the remaining work, that
  the launching might take place on November 7. Accordingly, the Project Mercury
  operations director requested range clearance for November 7 and also
  requested support by Naval recovery forces for this date.
  <P>Because of the continuing great urgency of Project Mercury, and because
  each succeeding launching hinges critically on the dates of previous
  launchings, the selection of November 7 as a launch date for MR-1 was the only
  possible [294] course of action to take for the operations director. In making
  this decision, he recognized that he was merely identifying the earliest
  possible launch date, and that this date might well be delayed if difficulties
  were to be encountered during the final checkout, or if bad weather was
  encountered. A later decision, on the other hand, would have been inexcusable
  for this might have caused unnecessary delays if all went well during the
  final checkout period.<A

was on the launch table on November 7, 1960, when the helium pressure dropped
from 2250 pounds per square inch to 500 pounds in the capsule control system,
and the mission was scrubbed again. The capsule was removed from its booster and
the heat shield was removed from the capsule so that a helium relief valve and
the toroidal hydrogen peroxide tank could be replaced. A wiring change was made
to avoid a failure of the Little Joe variety, and electrical sequence checks
were redone as reassembly proceeded. Then, on November 21, MR-1 was reassembled
and the final countdown proceeded normally, with the exception of a one-hour
hold to fix another leak in the capsule's hydrogen peroxide system. The Mercury
Control Center was manned for the first time. At 9 a.m. Redstone ignition
occurred precisely as scheduled.
<P>The expected blast momentarily churned the air around launch complex No. 56.
But then the roar stopped as suddenly as it had started. Watching by periscope
from the blockhouse, the startled engineers saw the booster wobble slightly on
its pedestal and settle back on its fins after, at the very most, a four-or-five-inch
liftoff. The Rocketdyne A-7 engine shut down, and the escape pylon
zipped up 4000 feet and landed about 400 yards away from the launch site. Three
seconds after the escape rocket blew, the drogue package shot upward, and then
the main chute spurted out of the top of the capsule followed by the reserve
parachute, and both fluttered down alongside the Redstone.
<P>Mercury-Redstone 1 was the most distressing, not to say embarrassing, failure
so far in Project Mercury. Critics waxed unrestrained. Even the Redstone experts
seemed disconcerted.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.73"><SUP>73</SUP></A>
Technically it seemed inexplicable that the normal, instead of the abort
ejection, sequence had followed engine shutdown. George Low later that day
carried STG's report to the NASA Headquarters staff on what they thought had
happened:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Apparently, sufficient thrust had developed to lift the booster at
  least 3/32 inch, thereby activating all the systems. (This would require more
  than 85% of nominal thrust.) The booster settled back down on the pad,
  damaging the tail fins, and perhaps the structure as well (some wrinkles are
  visible in the shell). The reason for this shutdown is unknown - the only
  shutdown to the booster could have come from the booster programmer, at the
  end of the normal flight sequence. Just how this programmer malfunctioned
  cannot be determined without a detailed inspection.
  <P>The capsule sequence . . . was a normal one for the type of signal it
  received. A closed-loop abort sensing system would have given an abort signal
  under the conditions of this launching, carrying the capsule away in a regular
  off-the-pad abort sequence.
  <P>At the time of this writing, the booster destruct system is still armed,
  and [295] cannot be disarmed until the battery depletion during the morning of
  November 22. Capsule pyrotechnics (including posigrade and retrograde rocket)
  are also armed. The problem is further complicated by the fact that the main
  parachute is still hanging from the capsule; thus the booster could be blown
  over in a high-wind condition. Weather predictions, however, are good. It is
  planned to put the gantry around the booster in the morning, under the
  assumption that the Redstone has not shifted sufficiently to make this
  impossible. This will be followed by booster and capsule disarming and
  sequence checks to determine the cause of the failure.
  <P>The extent of damage to the capsule has not yet been assessed. Assuming a
  minimum of damage, it is planned to use the same capsule, together with the
  MR-3 booster, for the MR-1 firing. It will probably take a month before this
  launching can take place.<A

<P>[296]
The day after the MR-1 attempt, Walter Burke of McDonnell volunteered to lead a
squad of men to disarm the pyrotechnics and umbilical cable still hanging fire.
Two days later, after intensive on-the-scene investigations of the puzzle
presented by MR-1, Low reported a better consensus of expert opinion:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The MR-1 failure is now believed to have been caused by a booster
  tail plug which is pulled out about one inch after liftoff.
  <P>It has been determined that this two-prong plug is designed so that one
  prong disconnects about one-half inch before the second one does. This time
  interval between disconnect of the first and second prongs for MR-1 was 21
  milliseconds.
  <P>The booster circuitry is such that if one of these prongs is disconnected
  prior to the other and while the booster is not grounded, a relay will close
  giving a normal engine cutoff signal. The time interval between successive
  disconnects was apparently just sufficient to allow the relay to close.
  <P>It is reasoned that Redstone missiles are somewhat lighter than the Mercury
  Redstone (with its extended tank), thereby giving higher initial acceleration
  and shorter time intervals between disconnects between the two prongs. This
  shorter time interval would be sufficient to allow the relay to close, thus
  having avoided this type of failure in the past.
  <P>This relay behavior could not be detected during checkout procedures since
  it will only occur when the booster is not grounded.
  <P>The above theory of failure was advanced by Marshall personnel at Cape
  Canaveral and has not been confirmed by Marshall-Huntsville. It is planned to
  continue tests at Huntsville using the Mercury-Redstone No. 2 booster to
  verify this hypothesis.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.75"><SUP>75</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Within
a week, MR-1 was rescheduled for December 19, and MR-2 and MR-3 had been
postponed until 1961. Low informed Silverstein that "The MR-1 capsule will be
used as is, together with the escape tower from Capsule 8, and the antenna
fairing from Capsule 10. The MR-3 booster will be used for this shot."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.76"><SUP>76</SUP></A>
There was no longer any question that the mating of booster and spacecraft
should be done at the Cape.
<P>Physicists observing MR-1 might have expected someone among the 5000 members
of the Marshall Center to have guarded against the relativity of simultaneity
where electrical signals were concerned, but McDonnell and Task Group engineers
dared not taunt their fellow workers on the Redstone about the cause of the
"four-inch flight" of MR-1. They were happy that the sequence system on the
capsule performed perfectly, but they too felt responsible for the failure of
the MR-1 capsule to abort. Meanwhile Joachim P. Kuettner and Earl Butler at
Huntsville, and Kurt Debus and Emil P. Bertram at the Cape, frantically drove
the men of their respective Redstone-Mercury Office and Launch Operations
Directorate to hasten preparations for MR-1A. By mid-December 1960, the Redstone
team assured Washington that the repeat flight was almost ready:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The November 21 type event will be avoided, in the future, by the
  addition of a ground cable sufficiently long to maintain a good ground
  connection until all umbilical plugs are pulled. In addition, the booster
  circuitry has been [297] modified so that a cutoff signal can only get to the
  capsule after 130 seconds of booster thrust (normal cutoff occurs at 140
  seconds). Before that time, the capsule can only be released from the booster
  through an abort signal, manually given from the ground.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.77"><SUP>77</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Minor
additional improvements were made to the capsule systems, a revised master
operational schedule was issued, the Mercury ground control operations team was
brought up to full strength, and Jerome Hammack, STG's Redstone project
engineer, along with Paul C. Donnelly, the Mercury-Redstone test conductor in
the blockhouse, worried through each day, hour, and minute before December 19.

<H3>MR-1A: Suborbital Quality Proven</H3>Early in the morning of December 19,
winds of 150 knots aloft in the jet stream required a 40-minute hold. During the
countdown another solenoid valve in the capsule's hydrogen peroxide system had
to be replaced, necessitating a recycle of the count by one hour. So it was 45
minutes before noon when the dramatic final 10 seconds of countdown for MR-1A
occurred. This time there were no fouls. The 83-foot Mercury-Redstone assembly
was cheered on - "Go! Fly, bird! Go!" - as it lifted off, burning brightly for
143 seconds to a velocity (slightly high) of 7120 feet per second at cutoff.
With this impetus, MR-1A coasted on up to 131 miles, its maximum altitude, then
nosed over while the bolts in the mating-ring exploded as planned and the
booster and its payload parted company. The capsule behaved perfectly in its
attitude control and came down along its predestined trajectory to impact 235
miles from Cape Canaveral, 18 miles beyond the desired target impact point.
<P>A P2V aircraft pilot saw the capsule descending on its parachute at 4000
feet, and about 35 minutes after launch a Marine helicopter from the aircraft
carrier <I>Valley Forge</I> retrieved the capsule, and returned it secure to the
flight deck of the carrier within 48 minutes from launch. This time Low elatedly
reported to Glennan that "the launching was an unqualified success."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.78"><SUP>78</SUP></A>
<P>The Goddard Space Flight Center computers, both men and machines, performed
admirably in making their first "real-time" impact prediction. On the <I>Valley
Forge</I> sailors crowded everywhere topside. Visual inspections of the capsule
by a NASA recovery inspection team revealed no damage except a crack in one
outer layer of glass in one capsule porthole.

<P>Exuberance was obvious in the postlaunch reports of the various participants.
Howard C. Kyle, the capsule communicator, said, "Except for a few minor
discrepancies during the countdown, all equipment appeared to operate normally.
Technical support was universally superb." Tecwyn Roberts, the flight dynamics
officer, wrote, "All communications checked A. OK. Data selection loop had some
noise, but intelligible communication was possible at all times." Henry E.
Clements, a captain in the Air Force and network status monitor, reported all
[299] instrumentation "A. OK," with few discrepancies. One note of caution was
entered by Stanley C. White, the Mercury Control Center flight surgeon:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The acceleration associated with the reentry exceeded by at least
  1 g the calculated value. If a similar overshoot occurs with the new profile
  being proposed on future MR flights, we are reaching the point where the
  astronaut has demonstrated inability to stay alert and to keep up with the
  events. The consequence of this aberration from predicted should be discussed
  before the new profile is accepted.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.79"><SUP>79</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>Later,
when the movies from the onboard camera were developed and shown, clean-room
engineers and workers saw the necessity for still higher standards of
cleanliness. Washers, nuts, and wire clippings came out from hidden niches and
floated freely around the cabin during the weightless period. But otherwise, the
Mercury team felt the pendulum of luck beginning to swing back in their favor at
the end of 1960. They were proud of the Christmas gift represented by the
demonstration of suborbital capability of the hardware in MR-1A.
<P>Perhaps the most significant result of the Little Joe 5 and MR-1 failures was
a profound reexamination among the managers of Project Mercury of their original
design philosophy. Warren North reported to Silverstein at Headquarters on
December 6 the results of a series of discussions among field hands on the
subject of man-machine integration:
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the week of November 27, Messrs. Gilruth, Williams,
  Mathews, Preston, Bland, Ricker, Fields, Roberts and others conducted a major
  review of the capsule and booster sequence logic in an effort to determine
  what improvements could be made to prevent incidents such as occurred during
  Little Joe 5 and MR-1. Also involved in the week long series of discussions at
  Cape Canaveral were key personnel from McDonnell (including Burke), Convair,
  Marshall, and Aerospace.
  <P>As a result of operational experience, it was apparent that some of the
  original design philosophy should be changed, especially insofar as the role
  of the pilot is concerned. It has become obvious that the complexity of the
  capsule and booster automatic system is compounded during the integration of
  the systems. The desirability of avoiding, for manned missions, a direct link
  between capsule and booster systems, is therefore being studied. For example,
  the Little Joe-type failure would be averted by the use of an open loop
  manually controlled abort system. Similarly, the escape tower would not have
  jettisoned during the MR-1 launch attempt if this had been a manned flight
  with manual control over the escape rocket and capsule sequence system.<A
  href="notes.htm#n9.80"><SUP>80</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Meanwhile
the Atlas, the basic vehicle to propel Mercury into orbit, also was undergoing
its most critical examination. A special ad hoc technical investigating
committee, established on December 19, 1960, composed of both NASA and Air Force
personnel, and headed by Richard V. Rhode of NASA Headquarters and Colonel Paul
E. Worthman of the Ballistic Missile Division, was ordered to investigate the
reasons why the Atlas had failed so often on NASA launches. Called the
Rhode-Worthman Committee informally, the dozen members, [300] representing all
concerned organizations, looked carefully at three recent failures in the
Atlas-Able series of lunar probes, at MA-1, and even at Big Joe, hoping to
prevent another fiasco. Since the conferees at the last major coordination
meeting, on November 16, had issued a test program summary reviewing MA-1 and
subsequent action, the Rhode-Worthman group began with those inconclusive
records and a set of 12 agreements on launch conditions for MA-2. Paul Purser
and Robert E. Vale flew to Los Angeles the day after Christmas to defend STG's
position on MA-1 and to expedite Convair's construction of a "quick-fix"
solution for MA-2 and its fabrication of "thick-skin" Atlases for subsequent
Mercury flights. Other members of the committee distrusted the original design
for the "quick fix," which was in the form of a "belly band," or girdle, to
strengthen the interface area around "station 502" on the Atlas booster, where
the adapter ring for the capsule nested against the lox dome. Later the
dissenting committee members supported a revised version of the fix after a
number of their suggestions had been integrated. Both Chamberlin and Yardley had
suggested the "belly band," but Hohmann disagreed. On December 31, 1960, Purser
warned Charles Donlan, back at Langley Field, that STG and Convair might be
overruled by Aerospace, STL, BMD, and NASA Headquarters representatives. As it
turned out, on the second day of the new year Rhode sent a message to Seamans at
NASA Headquarters that recommended great caution regarding the decision to
incorporate the "quick fix," as many of the committee felt that it added
uncertainty and possibly a new set of hazards. If so, MA-2 might have to wait
three to six months more for a "thick-skin" Atlas from the factory.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.81"><SUP>81</SUP></A>
<P>The year 1960 ended in suspense for the Mercury team. The Soviet attempt on
December 1-2, 1960, to orbit and retrieve two more dogs from space had, as the
Soviets admitted, ended in cremation for "Pchelka" and "Mushka" when their
attitude control system failed at retrofire and their vehicle, <I>Korabl Sputnik
III,</I> burned up on reentry from its rather too shallow orbit. To appraise the
meaning of the flight of the Soviets' third man-sized spaceship from available
information was exceedingly difficult. Obviously the Soviets were close to the
day when they could put a man into orbit, but the similar failures of their
first and third "cosmic ships," on May 19 and December 2, respectively, had made
the question "How close?" highly debatable.<A
href="notes.htm#n9.82"><SUP>82</SUP></A>
<P>On December 5, a member of the Soviet Academy of Science, G. Pokrovsky, had
extolled the "socialist system," in spite of its failure to recover Pchelka and
Mushka, and boasted that "we are on the threshold of manned space flight, and
the first man to be in space will undoubtedly be a Soviet citizen." That same
day, <I>Time</I> magazine had bemoaned "Lead-Footed Mercury" and ridiculed
Wernher von Braun's calling MR-1 "a little mishap": "Project Mercury's latest
failure, third in a row, just about evaporated the last faint wisp of hope that
the U.S. might put a man into space before Russia does." A <I>New York Times</I>
editorial agreed with that evaluation and advised the new President-elect to
persevere: "The first man in space will not be the last, and after the tributes
have been paid to that first man and those who made his feat possible the more
important question will arise of what man can do in space that is worth the
immense cost of putting him there."<A
href="notes.htm#n9.83"><SUP>83</SUP></A>
<P>Although there was some exultation in the United States after the success of
MR-1A on December 19, the public seemed to sense, without any deep
understanding, a difference of several orders of magnitude between Soviet space
flight tests and American qualification flight difficulties. Within the Space
Task Group, NASA, and the Mercury team, technical understanding, sometimes
divorced from political intuition, appeared to buttress the hope that an
American manned ballistic flight into space might still precede the
substantially more difficult manned orbital flight around Earth. Manned space
flight was a name for a series of field events in the space olympics. Although
the odds were with the Soviets to win the marathon of the first orbital
circumnavigation, perhaps Mercury might win the suborbital sprint.
