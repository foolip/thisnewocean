<H1>LJ-5A Still Premature</H1>"The purpose of the Little Joe 5A," began the 
technical information summary document issued for this flight on March 6, 1961, 
"is to qualify the Mercury capsule, escape system, and other systems which must 
function during and after escape at the combination of dynamic pressure, mach 
number, and flight path angle that represent the most severe conditions that can 
be anticipated during an orbital launch on an Atlas booster." Using McDonnell's 
capsule No. 14, the Little Joe flight test engineers at Wallops Island were 
behind schedule and eager to improve on the Little Joe 5 test, which had failed 
on Election Day in 1960. The premature ignition of the escape rocket motor, 
followed by the failure of the capsule to separate from the booster, still 
remained unexplained. It had made the prevention of such a recurrence one of the 
unstated first-order test objectives of LJ-5A. Using another of the beryllium 
heat-sink heatshields, two Castor and four Recruit rocket motors in the booster, 
a special backup retrorocket system, and much better instrumentation, William 
Bland and his crew from STG, together with John C. Palmer, the Wallops Island 
range director, also hoped to get better data on the capsule's structural 
integrity and on its sequential, landing, and recovery systems.<A

four-hour delay caused by checkout problems, Little Joe 5A roared and soared up 
from the beach at Wallops Island at 11 minutes before noon. The takeoff looked 
good, but 20 seconds later and 14 seconds too early the capsule escape rocket 
again fired without the capsule. Warren North described this flight graphically: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>At 35 seconds the normal abort signal released the capsule clamp 
  ring. A single retrorocket, which was installed as an emergency separation 
  device, received a premature firing signal at 43 seconds. The dynamic pressure 
  at this point was 400 psf - ten times as great as dynamic pressure at apogee 
  where emergency capsule separation should have taken place. The capsule 
  tumbled immediately upon separating and narrowly missed the booster as it 
  decelerated. The retropack and escape tower were inadvertently jettisoned or 
  torn off as the capsule tumbled. Apparently the centrifugal force and/or the 
  escape tower removed the antenna canister, deploying both the main and reserve 
  parachutes. The capsule descended on both parachutes which were only slightly 
  damaged during high q deployment.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-6.htm#source71"><SUP>71</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>Postflight 
analyses showed that both LJ-5 and LJ-5A had failed primarily because of 
structural deformations near the clamp rings that fouled the electromechanical 
separation systems.
<P>The impact bag on Little Joe 5A was deployed by its barostat at 10,000 feet. 
The capsule drifted 10 miles on both its parachutes and finally splashed down 18 
miles from the launch site, almost twice as far as planned. On top of that, the 
parachutes fell unreleased over the capsule as it floated in the water, thereby 
preventing helicopters from recovering it; a Navy salvage ship made the pickup 
an hour later. The capsule was in fairly good condition, with only one shingle 
damaged from its ordeal, and parachute loads six times higher than expected had 
caused no significant damage to its structure.
<P>Spectacular but disappointing had been this test. The primary objective of 
qualifying a Mercury capsule during a maximum-q abort had to be rescheduled four 
weeks later, utilizing the last Little Joe booster. Capsule No. 14 was cleaned 
up,repaired where necessary, and furnished with another set of sensors, 
instrumentation, and telemetry for the reflight coming up, the seventh in the 
Little Joe series and for that reason called prematurely "LJ-7." The postlaunch 
report for LJ-5A summarized the reason for renaming the last Little Joe flight 
LJ-5B: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Analysis of data show that the escape-rocket motor fired 
  prematurely and prior to capsule release, thus precluding accomplishment of 
  most of the first-order test objectives. The premature ignition was apparently 
  caused [328] by unscheduled closure of at least two of the capsule main clamp 
  ring limit switches.
  <P>Operation of a capsule backup system by ground command separated the 
  capsule from the booster and released the tower, making it possible for the 
  parachutes to deploy. The main and reserve parachutes were deployed 
  simultaneously under very severe flight conditions and enabled the capsule to 
  make a safe landing. However, in spite of the descent rate of 60 percent less 
  than normal, the heat shield caused some damage upon recontact. Examination of 
  the recovered capsule showed that it did not sustain any structural damage 
  sufficient to preclude its rapid refurbishment for another flight test.<A

was no time for more contingency planning if the United States hoped to orbit a 
man before the end of 1961. But for the moment the question in STG was not what 
could be done in nine months but what might be done in nine weeks.
