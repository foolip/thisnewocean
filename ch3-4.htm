<H1>A Moon for a Man</H1>Others in NACA, sensing the potential for manned space 
exploration that accompanied propulsion advances in military rocketry, began 
considering designs for a vehicle with which man could take his first step above 
the atmosphere. Early in 1954, Eggers, Julian Alien, and Stanford E. Neice of 
Ames put together a classic theoretical discussion of different space flight 
configurations in a paper entitled "A Comparative Analysis of the Performance of 
Long-Range Hypervelocity Vehicles." The research engineers examined the relative 
advantages, in terms of range and the ratio between payload and total weight, of 
three kinds [68] of manned hypersonic vehicles: ballistic, a blunt non-lifting, 
high-drag projectile skip; and glide, the last two designs also having fairly 
blunt noses but possessing some lifting ability. For satellite missions all 
three vehicles might be booster to orbital velocity by a rocket and could then 
separate from the rocket and go into free flight, or orbit.
<P>Eggers, Alien, and Neice found that the skip vehicle, which would return to 
Earth by performing an intricate series of progressively steeper dips into the 
atmosphere, would need an extremely powerful boost to circumnavigate the globe 
and also would encounter a prohibitively large amount of aerodynamic heating.<A

By contrast, the glider, although heavy, would require less boost and would keep 
the g forces imposed on the pilot during reentry at a quite acceptable level. 
Like the skip craft, the glider would provide the advantage of pilot control 
during the landing phase. It would radiate heat well, but since its 
thermodynamic load still would be high, the glider might experience dangerous 
interior heating during a "global" satellite) mission. So the authors suggested 
a high-lift glider; like the high-lift-over-drag glider, it would have a 
delta-wing configuration but also would feature thick, rounded sides and bottom 
to minimize interior heating. It would enter the atmosphere at a high angle of 
attack, then level off at lower altitudes to increase the lift/drag ratio.
<P>The ballistic vehicle, the simplest approach of the three, could not be 
controlled aerodynamically, but its blunt shape provided superior thermal 
protection, and its relatively light weight gave it a longer range. If it 
entered the atmosphere at a low angle, deceleration forces could be kept at or 
below 10 g, with 5 g lasting for 1 minute and 2 g for not over 3 minutes. 
Therefore the three NACA researchers concluded that "the ballistic vehicle 
appears to be a practical man-carrying machine, provided extreme care is 
exercised in supporting the man during atmospheric entry."<A

<P>As time passed, Eggers personally became convinced of the overall 
desirability of the manned satellite glider as opposed to the ballistic 
satellite. He revealed his preference in a modified version of the earlier paper 
done with Alien and Neice, which he read before the annual meeting of the 
American Rocket Society in San Francisco, in June 1957. Eggers was skeptical 
about the relatively high heating loads and the deceleration forces 
characteristic of ballistic reentry, even at a small entry angle. He warned that 
"the g's are sufficiently high to require that extreme care be given to the 
support of an occupant of a ballistic vehicle during atmospheric reentry," and 
pointed out that such an object, entering the atmosphere along a shallow 
trajectory so as to hold deceleration down to 7.5 g, would generate a surface 
temperature of at least 2,500 degrees F. Thus, in Eggers' judgment, "the glide 
vehicle is generally better suited than the ballistic vehicle for manned flight 
at hypersonic velocities."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-4.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>Eggers realized that his glider design, if actually built, would be too heavy 
for the military rockets then under development. At the same time he remained 
concerned about the deceleration loads imposed on the space pilot and the 
heating [69] loads on the spacecraft structure. He also saw the difficulty of 
recovering a ballistic satellite, which since it was noncontrollable in the 
atmosphere, would have to land somewhere in a target area of several thousand 
square miles. As a consequence of these apprehensions, during the last half of 
1957 he sketched a semiballistic device for manned orbital flight, blunt but 
having a certain amount of aerodynamic lift, with a nearly flat top and a round, 
deep bottom for heat protection. This design, which Eggers called the "M-1," 
fell about halfway between the high-lift glider and the ballistic vehicle 
discussed in his 1954 NACA study with Allen and Neice. About 10 feet wide and 
nearly seven feet long, the M-1 from above looked like an isosceles triangle 
rounded at its apex<A

A more graphic description was offered by Paul Purser, who called it a "¼ egg 
lifting shape." <A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch3-4.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>40 
The M-1's limited amount of lift would give it about 200 miles of lateral 
maneuverability during its descent through the atmosphere and about 800 miles of 
longitudinal discretion over its landing point. Eggers' calculations indicated 
that skillful piloting could keep reentry deceleration at about 2 g. 41<A

antipodal bomber done by Eugen Sänger and Irene Bredt for the Luftwaffe in World 
War II. See Eugen Sänger, <I>Rocket Flight Engineering</I>, NASA TT F-223

referred to as the "sled," after the nickname for a quite similar proposal first 
made in 1957 by Antonio Ferri and two others at the Gruen Applied Science 
Laboratories, of Hempstead, New York. See Antonio Ferri, Lewis Feldman, and 
Walter Daskin, "The Use of Lift for Re-entry from Satellite Trajectories," 
<I>Jet Propulsion</I>, XXVII (Nov. 1957), 1184-1191. Ferri, Feldman, and Daskin 
described a high-drag configuration which by flying at a proper angle of attack 
could produce a comparable amount of lift. Their vehicle would have an open top 
surface, and in this open area would be located a bubble-canopy sealed cabin. 
Reentry would be along a phugoid skip trajectory, with the lower surface of the 
vehicle acting as a heat sink.
