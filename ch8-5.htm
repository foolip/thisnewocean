<H1>Looking Over Mercury and Beyond</H1>In March and April 1960, NASA scored two 
spectacular triumphs by using the Air Force's Thor-Able booster combination to 
launch <I>Pioneer V</I> and <I>Tiros I</I>. The former was a highly successful 
instrumented probe to explore the space between the orbits of Earth and Venus. 
Launched on March 11, <I>Pioneer V</I> established a new telecommunications 
record of 22.5 million miles by the end of June and returned a bonanza of data 
on solar flares, particle energies and distribution, and magnetic field 
phenomena in translunar space. The initial Tiros weather satellite, sent up on 
April 1, transmitted the first global cloud-coverage photographs from a circular 
orbit 450 miles high, thereby inaugurating a new age for meteorology. The 
request for implementation of NASA's 10-year plan presented to Congress on 
January 20 seemed off to a good start. An extensive congressional "Review of the 
Space Program" put Mercury, even in the context of NASA's present programs, in 
perspective as a relatively minor part of the civilian space agency's 
activities. In terms of NASA's plans for the future or of the total 
military-civilian space program already in action, Project Mercury was hardly 
more than "an important first step in our manned exploration of space."<A

<P>Through the winter and spring of 1960, the big event toward which Mercury 
watchers looked with most anticipation was the launch of the first Atlas vehicle 
topped by a McDonnell capsule. Immediately after Big Joe, Gilruth had requested 
the Ballistic Missile Division to fly another Atlas along a Big Joe-type [249] 
trajectory to qualify the McDonnell capsule for launch and reentry from a 
circular orbit roughly 105 miles high. At the beginning of 1960, it still had 
looked as though this could be accomplished by the end of May. A semifinal 
Defense Department operations plan outlining the support tasks of a dozen 
different military commands was under intensive study during this period. 
Serious reappraisals of schedule requirements and alternatives were underway in 
many areas, most of which threatened to delay the start of the qualification 
flight. By the end of January it was obvious that the payload, McDonnell's 
capsule No. 6, for the first Mercury-Atlas launch (MA-1) could not be ready soon 
enough.<A

<P>The bottleneck was the production line. Back in October 1959, when a letter 
amendment to the prime contract for six additional Mercury capsules was being 
processed, McDonnell had estimated it could deliver capsule No. 1 by the end of 
November. To be sure, this would be a stripped model suitable only for an 
off-the-pad or beach-abort mission, but at that time it looked as if the firing 
date for this first qualification test could be set for the last day of 1959. It 
then seemed that capsule No. 2, allocated to the first Mercury-Redstone flight, 
also could be delivered before the end of the year and shot about March 20, 
1960. The sixth capsule, farther down McDonnell's production line, originally 
was allotted to the first Mercury-Atlas flight. It was barely framed, but 
McDonnell had hoped to deliver it by the end of February for a tentative launch 
date in mid-May. While STG was immersed in the Little Joe program, however, the 
production managers at McDonnell became aware that actual final assembly of the 
first capsules and equipment would take far more time than anticipated. On 
November 3, 1959, Sherwood L. Butler, the procurement officer at Langley, had 
notified NASA Headquarters that capsules Nos. 1 and 2 each would be delayed a 
month; No. 6 might be expected by the end of February.<A

<P>What, precisely, was causing these delays? Logan T. MacMillan, Edward M. 
Flesh, Yardley, and Dubusker of McDonnell felt constrained to answer as the 
pressure for delivery increased - as did certain conditions that obviously 
needed to be corrected. Incorporating the smallest changes during the final 
assembly of the first six capsules required many hours of disassembly, 
reassembly, and rechecking. Only one or two men at most could work in the 
confined space of the pressure vessel's interior, and rising standards of 
quality control imposed by McDonnell, STG, and resident Navy inspectors required 
much reworking.
<P>For example, on the first shift on January 6, 1960, J. E. Miller, the 
McDonnell inspector on the floor at the time, logged in his record book a local 
cause of delay: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Insp. discontinued all work on Cap. #1 this A.M. until the filthy 
  condition of the capsule was cleaned up. A meeting of Prod. Supervision was 
  called by Insp. &amp; Engr., was asked to set [sic] in. Quality control was 
  main subject &amp; all agreed to extend more effort toward better quality 
  control although Prod. did not think they could do much better than what was 
  already being done.<A

next week at a capsule coordination meeting in St. Louis, Purser and [250] 
MacMillan, Yardley and Faget persuaded Robert Gilruth to save MA-1 by swapping 
capsule No. 6 for capsule No. 4, which had been scheduled for a static firing on 
the Redstone. Number 4 should be tidied up as quickly as possible and shipped to 
Langley by the end of the month. Only a structural shell, this first delivered 
piece of production hardware did include the exterior shingles, heatshield, 
landing and recovery gear, missile adapter-ring, retropackage and straps, with 
dummy retros and live posigrades. STG undertook to install Big Joe-type 
instrumentation and sequencing for its rescheduled use on the first 
Mercury-Atlas flight. The plan was to return the capsule to McDonnell by April1 
for final shingle fittings and adapter matings, then ship the completed capsule 
to the Cape by mid-April. At the same time it was decided to eliminate the 
flotation bags, which had proved to be too delicate to last long in the open 
ocean, from all capsules and to keep the configuration of capsules Nos. 5 and 7 
unchanged in hope of making possible an earlier manned shot. Problems with the 
afterbody shingles and with the erosion of the window by the blast of the escape 
rocket were among a number left unsettled.<A

<P>As costs of solutions to these kinds of technological and training problems 
rose, NASA administrators appeared more frequently before Congressional 
committees and admitted their growing concern with manned space flight, as 
opposed to other space activities. T. Keith Glennan requested $23 million 
supplemental appropriation to the fiscal 1960 NASA budget of $500.6 million and 
justified $19 million of that extra sum on the basis of the urgent technological 
demands of Project Mercury. "It would be no exaggeration to say that the 
immediate focus of the U.S. space program is upon this project," stated 
Glennan.<A
