<H1>Zero G</H1>At peak speed and altitude an X-15 flight was supposed to afford 
about five minutes of "weightlessness" or "zero g." This is the effect created 
when a vehicle is balanced between centrifugal and centripetal forces - when the 
gravitational pull of Earth and other heavenly bodies is exactly balanced by the 
inertial character of the vehicle's motion. Weightlessness is undoubtedly the 
most fascinating medical characteristic of space flight, and it aroused the most 
speculation among aviation physicians in the late forties and early fifties. To 
be sure, approximations of zero g were not totally new human experiences; a 
common illustration of the sensation is the sudden partial lightening of the 
body in a rapidly descending elevator. But the necessity to function at zero g - 
to eat and drink, to eliminate body wastes, to operate the spacecraft controls - 
was a new requirement and presented new problems for the aeromedical teams.
<P>Flight physicians were almost unanimous in expressing forebodings about the 
effect of weightlessness on man's physical and mental performance. Some feared 
that the body organs depended on sustained gravity and would not function if 
deprived of the customary gravitational force. Others worried over the combined 
effects of acceleration, weightlessness, and the heavy deceleration during 
atmospheric entry. Still other experts were concerned especially about 
perception and equilibrium. For example, Heinz Haber and Otto Gauer, another 
émigré German physician who joined the Air Force aeromedical program, noted that 
the brain receives signals on the position, direction, and support of the body 
from four mechanisms - pressure on the nerves and organs, muscle tone, posture, 
and the labyrinth of the inner ear. They theorized that these four mechanisms 
might give conflicting signals in the weightless state and that such 
disturbances "may deeply affect the autonomic nervous functions and ultimately 
produce a very severe sensation of succumbence associated with an absolute 
incapacity to act."<A

<P>The basic difficulty retarding the study of weightlessness was the 
impossibility of duplicating the exact condition on Earth. The X-15, considered 
by many in the mid-fifties to be the penultimate step to manned orbital flight, 
progressed slowly and would fly too late to shed much light on the problem of 
zero g for Project Mercury. By the fall of 1958, however, when the newly formed 
National [37] Aeronautics and Space Administration undertook to orbit a manned 
satellite, American aeromedical researchers had been studying the gravity-free 
condition intensively for some eight years.
<P>The best but most expensive device for zero-g experimentation was the 
sounding rocket. For several years, beginning with the V-2 firings from White 
Sands, parachutes for nose cones containing rocket-launched animals invariably 
failed to open and the subjects were killed on impact. The first successful 
recovery came in September 1951, when an instrumented monkey and 11 mice 
survived an Aerobee launch to 236,000 feet from Holloman Air Force Base, New 
Mexico. The last of three Aerobee shots at Holloman, in May 1952, like the 
previous experiments, carried a camera on board to photograph two mice and two 
monkeys under acceleration, weightlessness, and deceleration. An Air Force 
aeromedical team, headed by James P. Henry, a physician who later would direct 
the Mercury animal program, and young Captain David G. Simons, found no adverse 
effects on the animals.<A

<P>For the next six years the priority military ballistic missile program almost 
monopolized rocket development in the United States. Medical experimentation 
employing live test subjects launched to high altitudes by rockets came to a 
virtual standstill. By contrast, during the same period from 1952 to 1957, 
researchers in the Soviet Union carried out numerous animal rocket flights, with 
dogs of the Pavlovian sort being their favorite passengers. By late 1957, when 
the Soviets sent the dog Laika into orbit aboard <I>Sputnik</I> II, the peak 
altitude of their vertical launches of animals was nearly 300 miles, and the 
Russian scientists had perfected a technique for catapulting animals from nose 
cones and recovering them with parachutes. Apparently the Russians also were 
able to measure a wider range of physiological reactions than their American 
counterparts.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>During the six-year hiatus in animal rocket experimentation in this country, 
investigators had to resort to the aircraft, "the oldest aeromedical 
laboratory," for studying the weightless phenomenon.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> 
In 1950, Fritz and Heinz Haber, of the Air Force School of Aviation Medicine, 
had considered various ways of simulating zero g for medical experiments. 
Discarding the free fall and the elevator ride, the Habers concluded that the 
best technique involved an airplane flight along a vertical parabola, or 
"Keplerian trajectory." If properly executed, such a maneuver could provide as 
much as 35 seconds of zero g and a somewhat longer period of subgravity, a 
condition wherein the body is under only partial gravitational stress.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> 
During the summer and fall of 1951 test pilots A. Scott Crossfield of NACA and 
Charles E. Yeager of the Air Force tried out the technique, flying a number of 
Keplerian trajectories in jet interceptors. Up to 20 seconds of weightlessness 
resulted from some of these flights. Crossfield reported initial "befuddlement" 
during zero g but no serious loss of muscle coordination, while Yeager described 
a sensation of falling and in one instance of spinning and feeling "lost in 
space." The latter sensation the physicians and psychologists called 
"disorientation."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>[38] The Habers' technique and these early experiments with it represented a 
promising beginning, but as one Air Force aeromedical specialist pointed out, 
"The results of these flights were inconclusive in many respects."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> 
An enormous amount of work remained before students of weightlessness could do 
much generalizing about this greatest anomaly of space flight.
<P>In 1953 a small group comprising the Space Biology Branch of the Aeromedical 
Field Laboratory at Holloman Air Force Base inaugurated an ambitious program of 
parabolic flights to continue the investigations of weightless flight that had 
halted with the termination of the Aerobee animal launches in the spring of 
1952. Supervised by Major David G. Simons, a physician who acted as test subject 
on many occasions, the Holloman studies for two years utilized T-33 and F-89 jet 
aircraft. Late in 1955, after Captain Grover J. D. Schock came to the field 
laboratory as task scientist, the standard tool for zero g research became the 
F-94C, which offered a longer parabola than other aircraft and thus a longer 
period of weightlessness. In the summer of 1958 the Air Force canceled all 
zero-g research at Holloman, and the coterie of scientists broke up. Colonel 
John P. Stapp, head of the field laboratory, and Simons went elsewhere, while 
Schock turned his attention to other research projects.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>For three years before the termination of the Holloman flight program, 
students of zero g at the School of Aviation Medicine had duplicated and even 
surpassed the investigations being carried out in New Mexico. Although sponsored 
by the Department of Space Medicine, the program carried out at Randolph Air 
Force Base was actually directed by Siegfried Gerathewohl, who was not a member 
of the department. Gerathewohl and his colleagues began their studies with the 
T-33 jet trainer, but like their counterparts in New Mexico, they soon turned to 
the superior F-94C. Major Herbert D. Stallings, a Randolph physician, estimated 
that by April 1958 he had flown more than 4,000 zero-g trajectories and compiled 
about 37 hours of weightless flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>Gerathewohl, Simons, Schock, and the other scientists at Randolph and 
Holloman tried to get as great a variety of information as possible during the 
30 to 40 seconds of weightlessness and subgravity produced by the F-94C flights. 
They carried out numerous eye-hand coordination tests, for example, wherein a 
subject tried to make crosses in a pattern or hit a target with a metal stylus. 
Subjects usually missed their mark in the first moments of zero g or subgravity, 
but most of them improved their performance with their cumulative experience. 
The Air Force scientists also studied eating and drinking, bladder function, and 
disorientation after awakening during weightlessness; the functions at zero g of 
various animals, especially cats, whose vestibular organs had been removed; and 
the phenomenon called the "oculo-agravic illusion," wherein luminous objects 
seen in the dark appear to move upward during weightlessness.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>At the Wright Air Development Center, in Ohio, a team of researchers headed 
by Major Edward L. Brown picked up the experimental program discontinued at 
Holloman in mid-1958, except that they used the relatively slow, 
propeller-driven [39] C-131 transport in their studies. A parabola in a C-131 
gave only 10 to 15 seconds of weightlessness, but the spacious interior of the 
cargo carrier made it possible to observe the reactions of several subjects 
simultaneously, including their coordination and locomotion and even their 
ability to walk along the ceiling while wearing shoes with magnetic soles.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>In general the aeromedical specialists at Randolph, Holloman, and 
Wright-Patterson - as well as those in more modest programs at the Navy School 
of Aviation Medicine, Pensacola, Florida, and at the NACA Lewis Flight 
Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland - found that the principal problems of 
weightless flight seemed solvable. Eating and drinking at zero g were not 
troublesome when squeeze bottles and tubes were used, and urination presented no 
real difficulty. Some subjects suffered nausea, disorientation, loss of 
coordination, and other disturbances, but the majority reported that after they 
adjusted to the condition they found it "pleasant" and had a feeling of 
"well-being."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> 
As early as 1955, Simons concluded that weightlessness produced no abnormalities 
with regard to heart rate and arterial and venous blood pressure, while Henry, 
Simons' colleague in the Aerobee animal experiments, prophesied, "In the skilled 
pilot weightlessness will probably have very little significance."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-3.htm#source22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> 
And in 1959, about a year after Project Mercury got underway, Gerathewohl 
remarked that "the majority of flying personnel enjoy the exposure to the 
subgravity state in our controlled experiments. We have reason to believe that 
even longer periods of absolute weightlessness can be tolerated if the crew is 
properly conditioned and equipped."<A
