numerous modifications and largely as an attempt to invalidate the Wright
Brothers' patents, Glen H. Curtiss flew the Langley aerodrome successfully with
pontoons. Fourteen years later the Smithsonian reconciled itself to the fact the
Wrights' airplane of 1903 was the first successful flying machine, rather than
Langley's aerodrome. See Abbot, "The Relations between the Smithsonian

Langley a pioneering variable-density wind tunnel, which featured the use of
compressed air to produce an airflow over small models, thus closely simulating
the flow over full-scale aircraft.
<P><A name=n1.9><SUP>9</SUP></A> Hunsaker, "Forty Years of Aeronautical
Research," 251-254; Levine, "U.S. Aeronautical Research Policy," 7-41. The
passage in 1926 of the Air Commerce Act, which made the Secretary of Commerce
responsible for encouraging and regulating civil aviation, clarified the role of
NACA and made possible the focus on aeronautical research.
<P><A name=n1.10><SUP>10</SUP></A> The great majority of the people who
joined the research staff of NACA during the history of the organization,
1915-1958, held degrees in engineering rather than the physical sciences. Thus
"research engineer" became the most common formal designation for those working
in aeronautical science for NACA.

structure, in addition to the 15-member Main Committee, which established the
research policies of the agency, and the various field installations, eventually
included four technical committees, charged with studying problems in particular
areas of aeronautical science and recommending to the Main Committee changes in
policy and practice. The membership of the various technical committees, like
that of the Main Committee, came from the military, the aircraft industry, and
the academic community. Each of the technical committees had subcommittees. In
1957 the technical committees were: Aerodynamics, Power Plants, Aircraft
Construction, and Operating Problems. See <I>Forty-third Annual Report of NACA -

<P><A name=n1.24><SUP>24</SUP></A> The best-known of these advisory groups
was the so-called von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n Committee, established late in 1944 at the
direction of Henry H. Arnold, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, and
headed by Theodore von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n, of the California Institute of Technology. After
surveying wartime achievements in aeronautical science and rocketry, the panel
of scientists published its findings in August 1945 and its recommendations in
December. While giving full credit to the German accomplishments in rocketry,
the von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n committee concluded that jet propulsion offered the key to "air
supremacy," and that progress toward long-range ballistic missiles should come
through the development of air-breathing pilotless aircraft. The philosophy
embodied in these 14 reports was to guide Air Force thinking for almost 10 years.
See Army Air Forces Scientific Advisory Group, <I>Toward New Horizons: A Report
to General of the Army H. H. Arnold</I> (14 vols. [Washington], 1945). For a
retrospect of the findings of the committee, see Hugh L. Dryden, "Toward the New
Horizons of Tomorrow: First Annual ARS von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n Lecture," <I>Astronautics</I>,
XII (Jan. 1963), 14-19. Dryden served as deputy scientific director to von
K&aacute;rm&aacute;n on the committee.

<P><A name=n1.26><SUP>26</SUP></A> The unitary plan was designed to provide
dispersed NACA-Air Force wind-tunnel facilities characterized by a minimum of
overlap and a maximum of variety. Five new supersonic wind tunnels were
constructed, one at each of the NACA laboratories and two at a new Air Force
installation, the Arnold Engineering Development Center at Tullahoma, Tenn. See

<P>The Langley engineers also pursued their transonic investigations with a
method devised in 1944 by Gilruth, whereby small models of wings or complete
aircraft were attached to the upper wing surface of an airplane, thus employing
the accelerated airflow over the wing surface for studying the aerodynamic
characteristics of the model at transonic speeds.

Missiles, and Space Travel</I>, 419-432. Because of the fear that the X-1,
operating with an entirely new rocket powerplant, might not be ready as early as
planned, the NACA-Air Force-Navy group concurrently developed a jet-propelled
research airplane, the Douglas D-558-1. This was also in keeping with NACA's
original conviction, shared by the Navy, that the first research aircraft would
be turbojet-powered.

<P><A name=n1.30><SUP>30</SUP></A> Probably the greatest NACA contribution to
the century series (F-100, etc.) was a discovery made in 1951 by Richard T.
Whitcomb, an aeronautical engineer working mainly in the recently opened 8-foot,
slotted-throat tunnel at the Langley laboratory. Whitcomb collected data on the
lengthwise distribution of fuselage and wing volume and suggested an airplane
configuration that minimized drag at supersonic speeds. Whitcomb's findings,
known as the "area rule," indicated that a coke-bottle, or wasp-waisted, shape
would significantly increase the speed of jet-propelled airplanes. The
importance of the area rule was reflected in the configuration of practically
every jet interceptor designed and built for both the Air Force and the Navy in
the mid-1950s. See Richard T. Whitcomb, "A Study of the Zero-Lift Drag-Rise
Characteristics of Wing-Body Combinations Near the Speed of Sound," NACA Tech.

<P><A name=n1.31><SUP>31</SUP></A> Discussions of the principles of rocketry
can be found in many places, but some of the most lucid explanations from the
layman's standpoint are in Ley, <I>Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel</I>,

and Space Exploration</I> (Princeton, N.J., 1958), 33-43. See also NASA news
release, unnumbered, "Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines," Jan. 1962. Equally
informative as an introduction to rocketry but historically important as a spur
to enthusiasts was G. Edward Pendray's <I>The Coming Age of Rocket Power</I>
(New York, 1945), wherein rocket efficiency was pictured as opening "the way to
an entire new world of velocities, altitudes, and powers which have hitherto
been closed to us; and consequently to a whole new world of human experiences
and possibilities" (p. 9).

Pendray, eds., <I>Rocket Development: Liquid-Fuel Rocket Research, 1929-1941</I>
(New York, 1961). The eastern daily newspapers seized on Goddard's "moon-rocket"
reference in his first Smithsonian paper and blew it completely out of
proportion. Some journals, having no conception of the mechanics of rocketry,
even ridiculed the idea that a rocket could ascend into space, because in a
vacuum it would have nothing to "react against." See, for example, the lead
editorial in <I>New York Times</I>, Jan. 13, 1920. The storm of embarrassing
publicity doubtless abetted the aversion to notoriety that characterized Goddard
throughout his career.

of the Peenem&uuml;nde rocket workers included the launching in the early part of
1945 of a winged A-4, called the A-9, which they had designed as the upper stage
of a rocket to attack the United States. And by the end of the war Eugen S&auml;nger,
already well-known as an Austrian rocket scientist before going to work for the
Luftwaffe, and Irene Bredt, a noted German physicist, had written an elaborate
report containing a design for an antipodal rocket bomber that would skip in and
out of the atmosphere to drop its payload and land halfway around the world. See

<P><A name=n1.61><SUP>61</SUP></A> The term "ballistic missile" refers to a
projectile fired along a ballistic, or high-arc, trajectory, reaching an
altitude of several hundred miles before falling freely toward its target. Such
a vehicle is to be distinguished from the jet-propelled guided missile, which is
controlled throughout its flight, requires oxygen within the air for its
propellant oxidizer, and can operate only within the atmosphere. Thus by
definition a ballistic missile, which reaches well into space, is a rocket.

think the Air Force philosophy of having industry do development and having the
capability of planning for production simultaneously is a much better way. . . .
The Air Force had quite a number of German scientists right after the war at
Wright Field, and made, deliberately made, the decision not to try to retain
that group of scientists as a group, similar to what they have done at Redstone,
and . . . most of them have gone into American industry. . . . They are at Convair,
they are at Bell, and a number of other companies, and . . . my feeling is that
these people, distributed to American industry, are doing equally as good a job
for the United States as this one small group that are still assembled at the
Redstone Arsenal." <I>Inquiry into Satellite and Missile Programs</I>, Part 2,

established by the Defense Department between the Air Force and the Army over
the Thor and the Jupiter, while perhaps necessary, proved intense, acrimonious,
and apparently wasteful. The full story of the Thor-Jupiter rivalry in the

with the "E" version, the guidance system of the Atlas became all-inertial,
meaning that all guidance components were carried aboard the rocket. General
Electric and Burroughs Corp. developed the radio-inertial guidance system for
the Atlas, while the American Bosch Arma Corp. produced the all-inertial system.
<P><A name=n1.76><SUP>76</SUP></A> Atmospheric entry heating was not a
critical problem for the medium-range (200-mile) Redstone, which did not develop
the velocities of the intermediate and intercontinental rockets. Thus protecting
the astronaut during the reentry phase of the suborbital (Redstone) flights in
Project Mercury, while deserving attention, was not of acute concern.

view of the continually modifying nature of astronautical terminology, the

interchangeably. They realize that some aerodynamicists make a distinction
between the two.
<P><A name=n1.78><SUP>78</SUP></A> Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, the now-famous
Russian "master spy" for the West in the Soviet intelligence system, supposedly
wrote as late as the first part of 1962: "Only the smaller (IRBM) missiles are
in production. . . . Right now we have a certain number of missiles with nuclear
warheads capable of reaching the United States or South America; but these are
single missiles, not in mass production, and they are far from perfect." (Frank
Gibney, ed., <I>The Penkovsky Papers</I>, trans. Peter Deriabin [Garden City,
N.Y., 1965], 331-348.) Thus while the Soviets may have been able to fire an
ICBM over its design range before the United States and use it to launch
relatively heavy satellites, they apparently had great troubles producing such a
military rocket in quantity, as the United States was doing by 1962 with its
Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman.

People interested in the physiology and psychology of extra-atmospheric flight
have devised a number of terms to describe their field of investigation -
biomedicine, space biology, astrobiology, bioastronautics, aerospace medicine.
The most suitable single term seems to be that used by Strughold, "space
medicine." It is used throughout this work except where more precise
terminology, such as "biodynamics," appears appropriate.

g. The Johnsville facility had a device allowing the gondola to be gimbaled to
simulate buffetings and cross-currents. The Wright Air Development Center
centrifuge, on the other hand, had a radius of 20 feet and a capability of 20 g.
Instead of a gondola it featured an open platform, which could be whirled in one

States and Canada conducted sensory deprivation studies, laboratory experiments
in which a subject was immersed in water in a blackened room and thus was
deprived of his visual, auditory, and kinesthetic senses. The experiments
indicated "a general loosening of the subject's ability to perceive reality and
the weakening of the stable norms against which perception is evaluated." Later
studies at the Navy Air Crew Equipment Laboratory in Philadelphia, the Air Force
School of Medicine, and the Wright Air Development Center demonstrated, however,
that stable, well-trained persons "can endure severe restrictions of their
natural habitat for relatively long periods of time without significant
degradation." Gerathewohl, <I>Principles of Bioastronautics</I>, 308, 311. See

of the terms "meteoroid," "meteorite," and "meteor." Throughout this study the
authors have employed what is apparently standard NASA terminology: a meteoroid
is a solid object larger that a molecule and smaller than an asteroid, moving in
interplanetary space; a meteorite is such an object that reaches Earth's surface
without completely vaporizing in the atmosphere; and a meteor is the light
phenomenon resulting from a meteoroid's entrance into the atmosphere.

the Viennese physics professor and philosopher Ernst Mach, who also devised the
unit of measurement representing the ratio of the speed of a body to the speed
of sound in the surrounding air, i.e., mach 1. The schlieren technique involves
training a beam of light perpendicular to the direction of the airflow to be
investigated. A camera is placed behind the light. The camera then photographs a
stationary or moving object in the light beam and the surrounding air-streaks,
which have varying densities and refractive indices resulting from aerodynamic
pressures. See Theodore von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n, <I>Aerodynamics: Selected Topics in the

for relatively lightweight reentry bodies, as warheads became heavier the total
heat absorbed and the rate of heating would probably dictate longer, more
slender shapes. Some blunting at the tip of the body, however, would continue to
be desirable. This is precisely the evolution that has occurred over the years
as rocket thrust has increased and warheads have grown heavier. See Herman H.

ironical that Nininger's 'proof' that blunt bodies are optimum was based on
observations of meteorites. All meteorites . . . enter the atmosphere in a speed
range for which one can demonstrate that a body which is pointed at the
stagnation point is the optimum and not the blunted body as proposed by Dr.
Nininger." Letter, Allen to C.C.A., Aug. 17, 1964.

described a high-drag configuration which by flying at a proper angle of attack
could produce a comparable amount of lift. Their vehicle would have an open top
surface, and in this open area would be located a bubble-canopy sealed cabin.
Reentry would be along a phugoid skip trajectory, with the lower surface of the
vehicle acting as a heat sink.

for Participation of NACA in Development and Testing of the Air Force System
464L Hypersonic Boost Glide Vehicle (Dyna-Soar I)," May 20, 1958, NASA Hist.
Archives. In July 1958 the Air Force awarded concurrent feasibility study
contracts to two contractor teams headed by the Martin Company and the Boeing
Company. Almost two years later, after Project Mercury was well underway, Martin
was chosen to build the booster system and Boeing the hypersonic vehicle itself.
By that time the Dyna-Soar concept called for a true satellite vehicle acting as
a controllable glider in the atmosphere. After a complex and controversial
history, Dyna-Soar finally fell victim to leapfrogging space technology,
particularly the two-man Gemini program initiated by NASA. Economy drives in the
Defense Department also played a part in this December 10, 1963, decision. After
an expenditure of over $350 million without a single test flight, and in the
face of a predicted total cost of around $800 million, Secretary of Defense
Robert S. McNamara ordered the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar project. On the
general characteristics of Dyna-Soar see, for example, Senate Committee on

concern at Langley over the prospect of space flight was a special course in
basic space technology, given by members of the Flight Research Division from
Feb. to May 1958. The lectures covered such subjects as lunar orbits, rocket
operation, aerodynamic heating of spacecraft, and the medical problems of space
flight. See "Notes on Space Technology Compiled by the Flight Research
Division," Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Feb.-May 1958. One of the members of
the Flight Research Division at the time has referred to these collected
lectures as "essentially the first U.S. textbook in space flight technology."

because of its unproven nature and because it supposedly would place a capsule
in a lower orbit than the Thor-fluorine rocket, necessitating more tracking
stations to maintain constant voice contact with the human passenger.

<P><A name=n4.82><SUP>82</SUP></A> "Development Proposal for Project Adam,"
Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Redstone Arsenal, Ala., April 17, 1958. The Adam
concept involved use of drag flaps to slow the nose cone's rate of descent and
provide aerodynamic stability during reentry. At lower altitudes, parachutes
would deploy to slow the capsule down still more. The development plan for Adam
specified that several primate flights would precede the first manned shot.
Unquestionably the most unusual technical aspect of Adam, and one that later
produced considerable amusement among the engineers who directed Project
Mercury, was the tank filled with water, into which the payload would be tossed
by an automatic mechanism in case of booster malfunction on the launch pad.

<P><A name=n4.90><SUP>90</SUP></A> The pros and cons of the military's place
in space have been debated almost incessantly since the immediate post-Sputnik
days. For a treatment of the controversy, see, for example, Vernon Van Dyke,
<I>Pride and Power: The Rationale of the Space Program</I> (Urbana, Ill., 1964).
In retrospect, it seems proper to conclude that "the real issue within the
Government was not whether to have a military or civilian space effort, but to
create suitable arrangements for both." House Committee on Government
