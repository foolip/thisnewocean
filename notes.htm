numerous modifications and largely as an attempt to invalidate the Wright
Brothers' patents, Glen H. Curtiss flew the Langley aerodrome successfully with
pontoons. Fourteen years later the Smithsonian reconciled itself to the fact the
Wrights' airplane of 1903 was the first successful flying machine, rather than
Langley's aerodrome. See Abbot, "The Relations between the Smithsonian

Langley a pioneering variable-density wind tunnel, which featured the use of
compressed air to produce an airflow over small models, thus closely simulating
the flow over full-scale aircraft.
<P><A name=n1.9><SUP>9</SUP></A> Hunsaker, "Forty Years of Aeronautical
Research," 251-254; Levine, "U.S. Aeronautical Research Policy," 7-41. The
passage in 1926 of the Air Commerce Act, which made the Secretary of Commerce
responsible for encouraging and regulating civil aviation, clarified the role of
NACA and made possible the focus on aeronautical research.
<P><A name=n1.10><SUP>10</SUP></A> The great majority of the people who
joined the research staff of NACA during the history of the organization,
1915-1958, held degrees in engineering rather than the physical sciences. Thus
"research engineer" became the most common formal designation for those working
in aeronautical science for NACA.

structure, in addition to the 15-member Main Committee, which established the
research policies of the agency, and the various field installations, eventually
included four technical committees, charged with studying problems in particular
areas of aeronautical science and recommending to the Main Committee changes in
policy and practice. The membership of the various technical committees, like
that of the Main Committee, came from the military, the aircraft industry, and
the academic community. Each of the technical committees had subcommittees. In
1957 the technical committees were: Aerodynamics, Power Plants, Aircraft
Construction, and Operating Problems. See <I>Forty-third Annual Report of NACA -

<P><A name=n1.24><SUP>24</SUP></A> The best-known of these advisory groups
was the so-called von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n Committee, established late in 1944 at the
direction of Henry H. Arnold, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, and
headed by Theodore von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n, of the California Institute of Technology. After
surveying wartime achievements in aeronautical science and rocketry, the panel
of scientists published its findings in August 1945 and its recommendations in
December. While giving full credit to the German accomplishments in rocketry,
the von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n committee concluded that jet propulsion offered the key to "air
supremacy," and that progress toward long-range ballistic missiles should come
through the development of air-breathing pilotless aircraft. The philosophy
embodied in these 14 reports was to guide Air Force thinking for almost 10 years.
See Army Air Forces Scientific Advisory Group, <I>Toward New Horizons: A Report
to General of the Army H. H. Arnold</I> (14 vols. [Washington], 1945). For a
retrospect of the findings of the committee, see Hugh L. Dryden, "Toward the New
Horizons of Tomorrow: First Annual ARS von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n Lecture," <I>Astronautics</I>,
XII (Jan. 1963), 14-19. Dryden served as deputy scientific director to von
K&aacute;rm&aacute;n on the committee.

<P><A name=n1.26><SUP>26</SUP></A> The unitary plan was designed to provide
dispersed NACA-Air Force wind-tunnel facilities characterized by a minimum of
overlap and a maximum of variety. Five new supersonic wind tunnels were
constructed, one at each of the NACA laboratories and two at a new Air Force
installation, the Arnold Engineering Development Center at Tullahoma, Tenn. See

<P>The Langley engineers also pursued their transonic investigations with a
method devised in 1944 by Gilruth, whereby small models of wings or complete
aircraft were attached to the upper wing surface of an airplane, thus employing
the accelerated airflow over the wing surface for studying the aerodynamic
characteristics of the model at transonic speeds.

Missiles, and Space Travel</I>, 419-432. Because of the fear that the X-1,
operating with an entirely new rocket powerplant, might not be ready as early as
planned, the NACA-Air Force-Navy group concurrently developed a jet-propelled
research airplane, the Douglas D-558-1. This was also in keeping with NACA's
original conviction, shared by the Navy, that the first research aircraft would
be turbojet-powered.

<P><A name=n1.30><SUP>30</SUP></A> Probably the greatest NACA contribution to
the century series (F-100, etc.) was a discovery made in 1951 by Richard T.
Whitcomb, an aeronautical engineer working mainly in the recently opened 8-foot,
slotted-throat tunnel at the Langley laboratory. Whitcomb collected data on the
lengthwise distribution of fuselage and wing volume and suggested an airplane
configuration that minimized drag at supersonic speeds. Whitcomb's findings,
known as the "area rule," indicated that a coke-bottle, or wasp-waisted, shape
would significantly increase the speed of jet-propelled airplanes. The
importance of the area rule was reflected in the configuration of practically
every jet interceptor designed and built for both the Air Force and the Navy in
the mid-1950s. See Richard T. Whitcomb, "A Study of the Zero-Lift Drag-Rise
Characteristics of Wing-Body Combinations Near the Speed of Sound," NACA Tech.

<P><A name=n1.31><SUP>31</SUP></A> Discussions of the principles of rocketry
can be found in many places, but some of the most lucid explanations from the
layman's standpoint are in Ley, <I>Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel</I>,

and Space Exploration</I> (Princeton, N.J., 1958), 33-43. See also NASA news
release, unnumbered, "Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines," Jan. 1962. Equally
informative as an introduction to rocketry but historically important as a spur
to enthusiasts was G. Edward Pendray's <I>The Coming Age of Rocket Power</I>
(New York, 1945), wherein rocket efficiency was pictured as opening "the way to
an entire new world of velocities, altitudes, and powers which have hitherto
been closed to us; and consequently to a whole new world of human experiences
and possibilities" (p. 9).

Pendray, eds., <I>Rocket Development: Liquid-Fuel Rocket Research, 1929-1941</I>
(New York, 1961). The eastern daily newspapers seized on Goddard's "moon-rocket"
reference in his first Smithsonian paper and blew it completely out of
proportion. Some journals, having no conception of the mechanics of rocketry,
even ridiculed the idea that a rocket could ascend into space, because in a
vacuum it would have nothing to "react against." See, for example, the lead
editorial in <I>New York Times</I>, Jan. 13, 1920. The storm of embarrassing
publicity doubtless abetted the aversion to notoriety that characterized Goddard
throughout his career.

of the Peenem&uuml;nde rocket workers included the launching in the early part of
1945 of a winged A-4, called the A-9, which they had designed as the upper stage
of a rocket to attack the United States. And by the end of the war Eugen S&auml;nger,
already well-known as an Austrian rocket scientist before going to work for the
Luftwaffe, and Irene Bredt, a noted German physicist, had written an elaborate
report containing a design for an antipodal rocket bomber that would skip in and
out of the atmosphere to drop its payload and land halfway around the world. See

<P><A name=n1.61><SUP>61</SUP></A> The term "ballistic missile" refers to a
projectile fired along a ballistic, or high-arc, trajectory, reaching an
altitude of several hundred miles before falling freely toward its target. Such
a vehicle is to be distinguished from the jet-propelled guided missile, which is
controlled throughout its flight, requires oxygen within the air for its
propellant oxidizer, and can operate only within the atmosphere. Thus by
definition a ballistic missile, which reaches well into space, is a rocket.

think the Air Force philosophy of having industry do development and having the
capability of planning for production simultaneously is a much better way. . . .
The Air Force had quite a number of German scientists right after the war at
Wright Field, and made, deliberately made, the decision not to try to retain
that group of scientists as a group, similar to what they have done at Redstone,
and . . . most of them have gone into American industry. . . . They are at Convair,
they are at Bell, and a number of other companies, and . . . my feeling is that
these people, distributed to American industry, are doing equally as good a job
for the United States as this one small group that are still assembled at the
Redstone Arsenal." <I>Inquiry into Satellite and Missile Programs</I>, Part 2,

established by the Defense Department between the Air Force and the Army over
the Thor and the Jupiter, while perhaps necessary, proved intense, acrimonious,
and apparently wasteful. The full story of the Thor-Jupiter rivalry in the

with the "E" version, the guidance system of the Atlas became all-inertial,
meaning that all guidance components were carried aboard the rocket. General
Electric and Burroughs Corp. developed the radio-inertial guidance system for
the Atlas, while the American Bosch Arma Corp. produced the all-inertial system.
<P><A name=n1.76><SUP>76</SUP></A> Atmospheric entry heating was not a
critical problem for the medium-range (200-mile) Redstone, which did not develop
the velocities of the intermediate and intercontinental rockets. Thus protecting
the astronaut during the reentry phase of the suborbital (Redstone) flights in
Project Mercury, while deserving attention, was not of acute concern.

view of the continually modifying nature of astronautical terminology, the

interchangeably. They realize that some aerodynamicists make a distinction
between the two.
<P><A name=n1.78><SUP>78</SUP></A> Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, the now-famous
Russian "master spy" for the West in the Soviet intelligence system, supposedly
wrote as late as the first part of 1962: "Only the smaller (IRBM) missiles are
in production. . . . Right now we have a certain number of missiles with nuclear
warheads capable of reaching the United States or South America; but these are
single missiles, not in mass production, and they are far from perfect." (Frank
Gibney, ed., <I>The Penkovsky Papers</I>, trans. Peter Deriabin [Garden City,
N.Y., 1965], 331-348.) Thus while the Soviets may have been able to fire an
ICBM over its design range before the United States and use it to launch
relatively heavy satellites, they apparently had great troubles producing such a
military rocket in quantity, as the United States was doing by 1962 with its
Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman.

People interested in the physiology and psychology of extra-atmospheric flight
have devised a number of terms to describe their field of investigation -
biomedicine, space biology, astrobiology, bioastronautics, aerospace medicine.
The most suitable single term seems to be that used by Strughold, "space
medicine." It is used throughout this work except where more precise
terminology, such as "biodynamics," appears appropriate.

g. The Johnsville facility had a device allowing the gondola to be gimbaled to
simulate buffetings and cross-currents. The Wright Air Development Center
centrifuge, on the other hand, had a radius of 20 feet and a capability of 20 g.
Instead of a gondola it featured an open platform, which could be whirled in one

States and Canada conducted sensory deprivation studies, laboratory experiments
in which a subject was immersed in water in a blackened room and thus was
deprived of his visual, auditory, and kinesthetic senses. The experiments
indicated "a general loosening of the subject's ability to perceive reality and
the weakening of the stable norms against which perception is evaluated." Later
studies at the Navy Air Crew Equipment Laboratory in Philadelphia, the Air Force
School of Medicine, and the Wright Air Development Center demonstrated, however,
that stable, well-trained persons "can endure severe restrictions of their
natural habitat for relatively long periods of time without significant
degradation." Gerathewohl, <I>Principles of Bioastronautics</I>, 308, 311. See

of the terms "meteoroid," "meteorite," and "meteor." Throughout this study the
authors have employed what is apparently standard NASA terminology: a meteoroid
is a solid object larger that a molecule and smaller than an asteroid, moving in
interplanetary space; a meteorite is such an object that reaches Earth's surface
without completely vaporizing in the atmosphere; and a meteor is the light
phenomenon resulting from a meteoroid's entrance into the atmosphere.

the Viennese physics professor and philosopher Ernst Mach, who also devised the
unit of measurement representing the ratio of the speed of a body to the speed
of sound in the surrounding air, i.e., mach 1. The schlieren technique involves
training a beam of light perpendicular to the direction of the airflow to be
investigated. A camera is placed behind the light. The camera then photographs a
stationary or moving object in the light beam and the surrounding air-streaks,
which have varying densities and refractive indices resulting from aerodynamic
pressures. See Theodore von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n, <I>Aerodynamics: Selected Topics in the

for relatively lightweight reentry bodies, as warheads became heavier the total
heat absorbed and the rate of heating would probably dictate longer, more
slender shapes. Some blunting at the tip of the body, however, would continue to
be desirable. This is precisely the evolution that has occurred over the years
as rocket thrust has increased and warheads have grown heavier. See Herman H.

ironical that Nininger's 'proof' that blunt bodies are optimum was based on
observations of meteorites. All meteorites . . . enter the atmosphere in a speed
range for which one can demonstrate that a body which is pointed at the
stagnation point is the optimum and not the blunted body as proposed by Dr.
Nininger." Letter, Allen to C.C.A., Aug. 17, 1964.

described a high-drag configuration which by flying at a proper angle of attack
could produce a comparable amount of lift. Their vehicle would have an open top
surface, and in this open area would be located a bubble-canopy sealed cabin.
Reentry would be along a phugoid skip trajectory, with the lower surface of the
vehicle acting as a heat sink.

for Participation of NACA in Development and Testing of the Air Force System
464L Hypersonic Boost Glide Vehicle (Dyna-Soar I)," May 20, 1958, NASA Hist.
Archives. In July 1958 the Air Force awarded concurrent feasibility study
contracts to two contractor teams headed by the Martin Company and the Boeing
Company. Almost two years later, after Project Mercury was well underway, Martin
was chosen to build the booster system and Boeing the hypersonic vehicle itself.
By that time the Dyna-Soar concept called for a true satellite vehicle acting as
a controllable glider in the atmosphere. After a complex and controversial
history, Dyna-Soar finally fell victim to leapfrogging space technology,
particularly the two-man Gemini program initiated by NASA. Economy drives in the
Defense Department also played a part in this December 10, 1963, decision. After
an expenditure of over $350 million without a single test flight, and in the
face of a predicted total cost of around $800 million, Secretary of Defense
Robert S. McNamara ordered the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar project. On the
general characteristics of Dyna-Soar see, for example, Senate Committee on

concern at Langley over the prospect of space flight was a special course in
basic space technology, given by members of the Flight Research Division from
Feb. to May 1958. The lectures covered such subjects as lunar orbits, rocket
operation, aerodynamic heating of spacecraft, and the medical problems of space
flight. See "Notes on Space Technology Compiled by the Flight Research
Division," Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Feb.-May 1958. One of the members of
the Flight Research Division at the time has referred to these collected
lectures as "essentially the first U.S. textbook in space flight technology."

because of its unproven nature and because it supposedly would place a capsule
in a lower orbit than the Thor-fluorine rocket, necessitating more tracking
stations to maintain constant voice contact with the human passenger.

Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Redstone Arsenal, Ala., April 17, 1958. The Adam
concept involved use of drag flaps to slow the nose cone's rate of descent and
provide aerodynamic stability during reentry. At lower altitudes, parachutes
would deploy to slow the capsule down still more. The development plan for Adam
specified that several primate flights would precede the first manned shot.
Unquestionably the most unusual technical aspect of Adam, and one that later
produced considerable amusement among the engineers who directed Project
Mercury, was the tank filled with water, into which the payload would be tossed
by an automatic mechanism in case of booster malfunction on the launch pad.

<P><A name=n5.9><SUP>9</SUP></A> "Background Information on Langley Research
Center," Public Affairs Office, LRC, June 1960. The bulk of the professional
staff consisted of "aeronautical research engineers." Since about 1954 some
engineers, recruited from industry or from "accredited" schools of aeronautics,
together with senior and most valuable members of the NACA laboratory teams, had
been given more nearly competitive salaries and the title of "aeronautical
research scientist." College accreditation and comparative evaluation were as
problematical in this as in any other field, but institutions with high
reputations for excellence in aeronautical engineering and aerodynamics included
the California and Massachusetts Institutes of Technology, Stanford, Michigan
State, and Cornell Universities, and many others certified by various
professional societies.
<P><A name=n5.10><SUP>10</SUP></A> A few generalizations may be hazarded
about Langley before 1959. Most of its professional staff came from the South
and Midwest; few had been academically trained as aeronautical engineers; most
held only bachelor's degrees, usually in mechanical or electrical engineering,
often from Georgia Institute of Technology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, or
Auburn University. An esprit de corps based on many years of valuable service to
aviation and to the nation seems to have been pervasive. And certainly the
Langley professional people always would insist on their own experience and
contributions as having proved the artificiality of invidious distinctions
between science and engineering. Most helpful for understanding the nature of
governmental management of applied science is David Novick, "What Do We Mean By
Research and Development?" in <I>California Management Review</I> (Spring 1960),
21, as quoted in Merton J. Peck and Frederick M. Scherer, <I>The Weapons

Editions, Inc., 1961), 97-112. The difference between "sounding" and "probe"
rocket flights was generally accepted by 1958 as being a matter of altitude,
with the division point at a height of one Earth radius. Sounding rockets were
those ascending to about 3900 miles; instrumented rockets going higher than that
were called probes. On the word "aerospace" as used by the Air Force, see David

<P><A name=n6.68><SUP>68</SUP></A> It seems fitting to note here the Air
Force viewpoint on this period. Max Rosenberg, Chief, USAF Historical Division
Liaison Office, has commented as follows on this section (Oct. 8, 1965): "Within
these pages is the story of the major crux of program slippages, which seems not
to be recognized. There is detailed listing of each agency's role but no
recognition that no one was in charge of <I>total system</I> analysis, <I>total
system</I> design, <I>total system</I> engineering, <I>total system</I>
technical direction. This was one of the features of the Air Force ballistic
missile program wherein Ramo-Wooldridge functioned as the <I>systems</I>
engineering and technical director. The lack of such an agency within the
Mercury program was understandable, for NASA was without experience in
undertakings of such scope and magnitude, but it should be recognized and
recorded historically as an expensive 'lesson learned' that cost NASA (and the
United States) perhaps a year or more in meeting the Mercury goals." P. 13.

wrote, "Heaven has always existed in the mind of man as the abode of spiritual
beings and the ultimate destination of believers. Its location has always been
'up'. . . . And now at last man is about to ascend physically into this heaven.
. . . Will his spiritual outlook be changed by a shock of disillusion? . . ."
<H3>Chapter VII</H3>
<P><A name=n7.1><SUP>1</SUP></A> In considering how both technology and
techniques began to evolve through the planning and tooling stages and into
manufacturing and production, this chapter and the next make the conventional
yet conceptually useful distinction between mechanical and human (factors)
engineering endeavors. Another important distinction, that which rated pilot
safety first and mission success second, was implicit from the start, but became
explicit in the production programs only after many technical arguments and much
rethinking. The process of man-rating the machines is meant to suggest all the
efforts made to perfect a completely automatic system for Earth-orbital flight.
The reciprocal process of machine-rating men is meant to focus on the
ambiguities in the idea of perfecting a completely automated system for such
purposes. Chronologically this division coincides with the major, but by no
means singular, concern of those responsible for the execution of Project
Mercury during the year of development between the summers of 1959 and 1960.

Flight Safety Problems of Manned Spacecraft Flight," April 4, 1962, 5. The crux
of the reliability dispute between "statistics," represented by Golovin and NASA
Headquarters, and "techniques," represented by STG, McDonnell, and ABMA, was
illustrated by the basic commitment among STG engineers to deny the existence of
any such thing as "a random failure." Gilruth later expressed this particular
attitude toward man-rating machines: "We must regard every malfunction and, in
fact, every observed peculiarity in the behavior of a system as an important
warning of potential disaster. Only when the cause is thoroughly understood, and
a change to eliminate it has been made, can we proceed with the flight program."

<P><A name=n7.59><SUP>59</SUP></A> The input of sense data into the ASCS and
its output of nervous commands suggests the classic cybernetic approach to
understanding the Mercury attitude control system. Consider the machine as if it
were an organism in which sensors (like small rate gyros, larger position gyros,
and infrared sensitive horizon scanners) provide the brain (ASCS) with the data
it needs to compute through its amplifier-calibrators and logic boards the
actions required by the muscles (RCS motors) in order to maintain a certain
position. Sense organs, a brain, and muscles are necessary black boxes to the
performance of any self-regulating system, but Mercury design engineers seldom
bothered at first to produce "glass boxes" for operating engineers to determine
how to build, work, and improve them. For a helpful introduction to the
intricacies of modern gyroscopes, accelerometers, and inertial guidance systems,

Deep, while Jacques Piccard, the son of Auguste who had designed the
<I>Trieste</I>, and Donald Walsh, a Navy lieutenant, squeezed themselves into
the bathyspherical gondola beneath their hydrostatic balloon. In this third of a
series of dives, Piccard and Walsh sank down 7000 fathoms, or eight miles, where
their vehicle endured 1085 tons of pressure per square foot and where they saw
life on the bottom of the ocean. For all mankind, Piccard and Walsh figuratively
"took possession of the abyss, the last extreme on our Earth that remained
unconquered." Three months later, on April 25, 1960, the nuclear-powered
submarine <I>Triton</I>, with 183 Americans captained by Edward L. Beach,
completed the world's first undersea circumnavigation, following for two months
submerged the wake of Magellan's ship, the <I>Victoria</I>, at an average speed
of 18 knots for 41,519 miles. The inertial guidance navigation system that made
the trip of the <I>Triton</I> possible had grown out of the same research and

<P><A name=n8.20><SUP>20</SUP></A> Certainly the most delicate of all such
interfaces for the first few leaps into space was that between the biosensors
and human skins. The issue of the rectal thermometer designed into the suit was
accepted for the moment as a necessary intrusion. See memo, Wheelwright to

<P><A name=n8.21><SUP>21</SUP></A> Suit pressure was maintained by a demand
regulator that metered the oxygen into the system. If cabin pressure failed, the
demand regulator sensed the pressure loss, sealed the suit, and maintained it at
4.6 pounds. Should both systems fail - suit and cabin - there was an emergency
oxygen valve that fed directly into the inlet hose at the waist junction. Before
May 1961, the pressure suit had received 514 hours of manned testing.
<P>Oxygen was metered into the cabin by a regulator to maintain a minimum limit
of 5.1 pounds. In designed operation, the cabin system remained at ambient
pressure on the pad and up to 27,000 feet. At that altitude it sealed off at 5.5
pounds. If there were a fire or a buildup of toxic gases, the astronaut could
decompress the cabin manually, exhaust the toxic odors, and repressurize it.
This system received 135 manned test hours at the Navy's Aviation Medical
Acceleration Laboratory before May 3, 1961.

the human. Tasks associated with subsystems for where this sum is low should be

to the evaluation of design tradeoffs and the construction of training program."

<P>&ldquo;It has also been found possible to make the configuration of the capsules
for MR-2 . . . and MR-3 identical. The missions of these capsules remain
unchanged. However, in order for the basic capsules to be identical, the
quantities to be recorded for the primate carried in MR-2 must remain the same
as those to be recorded for the man in MR-3. The advantage of making these
capsules identical is that otherwise the first manned flight would have been in
a capsule that differed in several respects from those that had been fired
previously. Now there will be at least one firing of an identical capsule before
inserting a man.
<P>"The operations required for preparation and launch of the capsule have
received very careful study, and it has been concluded that these operations
will require much more time than was previously estimated. The resultant program
with the delayed capsule deliveries was, however, felt to be unacceptable. For
this reason, new, rather optimistic target times have been set for the checkout
and launch period, and a study has been instituted to see whether these
schedules can be met by careful planning of the work and facility utilization
and by extra work shifts. The effects of all these factors are being considered
in formulating a new schedule."

<P><A name=n8.88><SUP>88</SUP></A> Rosholt, <I>Administrative History of

(pp. 157-158):
<P>&ldquo;The report revealed that NASA's record in supervising its out-of-house
efforts was spotty. Difficulties had arisen because NASA neglected certain basic
prerequisites to effective contractor supervision, such as adequate statements
of work, sufficient and flexible funding, and properly focused technical
responsibility. (A basic problem in connection with the last named prerequisite
was NASA's tendency to establish two channels of supervision - one from
headquarters, the other from the field center.)
<P>"NASA's supervisory job was difficult in that it could neither use the 'trust
the contractor' approach (high reliability was too crucial to be left to the
contractor alone) nor the 'tight control' approach (which would 'discourage
contractor creativity and initiative'). . . . Therefore NASA had to follow a
middle course, which combined contractor operating freedom with close NASA
guidance. To achieve this balance it would be essential that there be a constant
flow of information back and forth between NASA and the contractor. This flow
could be promoted by periodic progress review meetings between NASA and the
contractor, the placement of a NASA representative in the contractor's plant (to
permit continuous face to face communication), and the use of a progress

of Project Mercury Schedules," with enclosures, including a chronology, Aug. 14,
1960. Significant excerpts from this memo illustrated other features of
Headquarters concerns:
<P>&ldquo;A major factor in the compressed Mercury schedule is concurrent effort in
the areas of research and development, design, and manufacturing. As a result of
this concurrent effort, many of the capsule subcontractors underestimated their
costs and delivery dates. As early as October 1959, McDonnell anticipated cost
increases ranging from 200% to 450% from some of their major subcontractors,
such as Bell Aircraft, AiResearch, Collins Radio, and Grand Central Rocket.
<P>&ldquo;Because of different flight test objectives, it is possible to fly some of
the early capsules with incomplete and unqualified systems.
<P>&ldquo;From the standpoint of project urgency, it was consistent policy to set . .
. classified target schedules as tight as possible. . . . However, since problem
areas cannot be pinpointed in advance, it was felt that the project objectives
could be most rapidly achieved by purposely setting optimistic target schedules
and keeping everyone working to meet these dates. . . .
<P>"One is tempted to extrapolate . . . thereby obtaining May 1961 and November
1961, as the actual launch dates for the manned Redstone and manned orbital
flights. It is hoped, however, that based on past experience, subsequent
capsules can be more accurately scheduled through capsule systems checkout.
Conversely, it must also be remembered that as yet none of the production
capsules have been qualified during the maximum Q abort and reentry missions."

illustrations and the updated figures on space costs and accomplishments, the
August 1961 revision of this report contained one significant addition, namely a
two-page (20-22) discussion in the national security section entitled
"Interpreting The Race," which said in part:
<P>&ldquo;The fact that we are racing the Russians to the moon and the planets should
not be allowed to obscure certain facets of the precise situation we are in.
<P>&ldquo;To begin with, it is essential to realize that sending men beyond earth's
environment requires rockets of very high thrust - big boosters. The Soviets,
who have about a 5-year jump on the United States in this field, have such
rockets in operation. Our biggest ones are still in the development stage,
although they are showing considerable promise. So we begin this particular
phase of 'the race' under a marked handicap and doubtless will be in second
place for some time to come.
<P>&ldquo;It is equally important, however, to recognize that 'getting there first' is
only one part of the race. Two other parts are just as crucial:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>What will we learn from our effort to explore beyond the Earth?
  <LI>How will we use this knowledge after it is acquired?</LI></OL>&ldquo;The Vikings
had the technique to get to the New World 'first,' but England, France, and
Spain won the prizes.... With no intent to deprecate the notable achievements of
the Soviet Union in space research, it can nonetheless be said that the broad
scope of the American effort has - thus far at least - been outstanding in its
scientific results. And, as subsequent parts of this report suggest, our free
enterprise system has been quick to take advantage of the technological fall
out.
<P>"In summary, our international prestige and stature, so far as they are
influenced by our space activities, depend on all three elements of 'the race' -
not on one or two."

<P>&ldquo;The really interesting scheme requires starting all over. Consider six (6)
Pioneer or Explorer second stage motors clustered together as a
posigrade-retrograde power pack. . . .
<P>"On the subject of parachutes and weights: it is quite likely that the impact
skirt system and its associated 100 pounds of weight could be eliminated if the
capsule impact attitude could be restricted to 'pilot feet first' and without
much swing. The main difficulty now is the pilot's low tolerance to lateral
acceleration. . . . This is not a proposal but it's worth thinking of."

<P><A name=n9.80><SUP>80</SUP></A> Memo, North to Dir., Space Flight
Programs, "Mercury Capsule Changes and Flight Schedule," Dec. 6, 1960:
<P>"Open loop operation of the Abort Sensing and Implementation System (ASIS) is
a change which does not detract from the effectivity of the system. This change,
in fact, makes the system more reliable and effective because a pilot who is
placed in the control loop has the ability to assess whether a true abort
situation exists. In this concept, the pilot would get a red light indication
that an abort is called for but would manually activate the escape sequence. The
inherent aerodynamic stability and high structural strength of the Redstone
should provide a sufficient time constant between capsule abort light indication
and time for abort decision. The pilot, after observing the abort light, can
either immediately abort, if he is in a critical flight regime, or he can rely
on secondary cues such as changes in acceleration, changes in attitude, and
radio voice transmissions from visual observers or telemeter monitors. Although
it is reasonably clear that the Redstone should be flown with an open loop ASIS,
the Atlas operational procedure is not yet resolved because allowable pilot
reaction time will be somewhat less. I feel, however, that experience with the
manned Redstone will convince us that the manned Atlas should also be flown open
loop. Incidentally, three Atlas ASIS systems have been flown open loop to date;
two would have caused inadvertent aborts."
