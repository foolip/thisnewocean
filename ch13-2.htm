<H1>Preparing a Man to Orbit</H1>Of course, hardware was only part of the 
problem of readying MA-6. What about the second half of the "spacecraft-man" 
combination? Would the man be just a passenger-observer or a participating 
system? By mid-September 1961, Robert B. Voas, the astronauts' training officer, 
had drawn up a number of basic specifications concerning the pilot's duties in 
MA-6 in answer to questions of this sort. If some part of the automatic attitude 
control system should fail, for example, the pilot would need to control 
spacecraft attitude using the manual system. Or if displayed information on the 
spacecraft's attitude position should malfunction, the pilot would have to take 
over and rely on his visual abilities for position reckoning by external 
references. Voas had studied high-altitude photographs of the MA-4 flight and he 
knew that on the sunlit side of Earth the horizon should quickly provide an 
excellent capsule attitude reference, but the nightside might present problems 
unless there was bright moonlight. Possibly known stars could serve as attitude 
reference points, he theorized. Voas also felt that a comparison of window and 
periscope reference was needed.<A

<P>To measure man's potential as a spatial navigator, Voas wanted the astronaut 
to look for the smallest detectable landmark, to estimate the effects of weather 
conditions on visibility, and to judge precisely the occultation of the stars by 
Earth's atmosphere. Theoretically, from the vantage point of the orbital flight 
trajectory an astronaut should see about a 900-mile arc of the horizon. He 
should be able to determine how much of this was effective horizon in terms of 
his ability to recognize a landmark with the unaided eye. One important facet of 
any later space exploration, Voas said, would be man's visual acuity in 
estimating spatial depth and distance; tracking an artificial object in a nearly 
identical orbit during a Mercury circumnavigation would partially test this 
ability. The spent Atlas tankage trailing the capsule should offer an excellent 
opportunity in this respect.
<P>[414]Ever since the Soviet reports of Gherman Titov's sensations of dizziness 
and nausea caused by his head and body movements, some aeromedical specialists 
had worried that perhaps the prolonged absence of gravitational stress did 
adversely affect a space passenger or pilot. Voas, considering this subject, 
contended that it was impossible to say whether Titov had had a purely personal 
aversion to weightlessness or whether men in general would have similar troubles 
under zero g. Neither Alan Shepard nor Virgil Grissom had experienced vertigo 
during the two Mercury suborbital flights. Voas felt that if disorientation and 
nausea were in fact products of longer durations of weightlessness, as some 
physicians and physiologists believed, the symptoms could be remedied through 
preflight training, proper flight procedures, or, if necessary, by drugs.
<P>Voas acquainted the astronauts with the probable effects of weightlessness on 
their sensory organs. The otoliths, the ear's angular accelerometers, should not 
be affected, he said. Muscle and skin sensory functions should be affected only 
slightly, but those muscles sensing the amount of gravity would lose their 
acuity completely. By and large, the general diminution of sensory perception 
accompanying space flight should be overcome by the astronaut's eyes and his 
memory. To test his theories, Voas prescribed an experiment to be conducted on 
the dark side of Earth. The pilot would touch certain panel dials with his eyes 
open and then with his eyes closed, after moving his head quickly to the right, 
left, and forward. Gordon Cooper expressed qualms felt by several people over 
Voas' "blind flying" test when he remarked, "You shouldn't be reaching over on 
this panel with your eyes shut."
<P>Other tasks planned by Voas included taking pictures through the window and 
periscope with a hand-held camera, describing the cloud cover on the day side, 
and looking for lightning in squall lines as requested by the United States 
Weather Bureau. On the night side the pilot should repeat those tasks and 
observe the aurora and luminescence of Earth's clouds. Finally, he should scan 
the star fields, the Milky Way, and note the size and appearance of the Moon as 
well as describe a moonset.<A

<P>The September study by Voas included the initial efforts of the Space Task 
Group to foster a scientific inroad into the manned space flight program. After 
distributing his paper among the astronauts and receiving favorable comment from 
several, Voas then sought the assistance of NASA Headquarters to obtain a 
broader base for possible astronaut activities in space from the various 
scientific disciplines that were available. Homer E. Newell and Nancy G. Roman 
of that organization reacted by directing the formation of an ad hoc committee 
for astronomical tasks for the Mercury pilots, assigning Jocelyn R. Gill as the 
committee chairman. This group was an offshoot of the formal Astronomy 
Subcommittee, a part of NASA's Space Sciences Steering Committee.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source7"><SUP>7</A></SUP>
<P>As a beginning Gill and Voas attended a meeting of the Astronomy Subcommittee 
held at the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, Bethpage, New York, on 
October 30-31, 1961. Voas reviewed the abilities of the astronauts [415] to 
assume some additional tasks, such as observations of astronomical phenomena. He 
also cautioned that any integration of scientific equipment inside the 
spacecraft would have to be severely restricted in weight. The Astronomy 
Subcommittee discussed the possibilities and then suggested 10 tasks that an 
astronaut might accomplish. A few of these were: observe the night airglow as to 
its intensity and structure, look for comets before sunset and after dawn, note 
the frequency of meteor flashes, look for the aurora and describe its intensity, 
sketch the zodiacal light relative to the star background, and observe the size 
and position relative to the star background of the gegenschein.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source8"><SUP>8</A></SUP>
<P>Besides generally acquainting the Mercury astronauts with the spatial 
environment, their possible reactions, and what they might accomplish in the way 
of operations and scientific observations, Voas also had pressed forward with a 
plan for a specific training program to prepare the crewmen to operate and 
manage the spacecraft systems on orbital missions. He first compiled a list of 
proposed training activities, and then he called a meeting at Langley on 
September 26 to discuss his report. The STG officers present adopted the 
training proposal, which became a formal working paper on October 13. With 
slight subsequent amendments, this working paper, No. 206, spelled out the 
astronaut training and preparation procedures that would be followed for the 
rest of the Mercury program.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source9"><SUP>9</A></SUP>
<P>The first stated prerequisite for the astronaut, as formulated by Raymond G. 
Zedekar of STG, was a thorough familiarity with the spacecraft and all its 
systems. He must know every mission detail, including every flight and ground 
rule; he would be expected to demonstrate peak performance in every task during 
the flight; and his skills must include making failure diagnoses and taking the 
proper corrective action.
<P>Preparing the pilot for his role during an orbital mission, the astronaut 
training personnel obviously could draw heavily on Shepard's and Grissom's 
suborbital experiences. The nine separate checkouts of the spacecraft after it 
arrived at the Cape, they felt, would provide excellent familiarization and 
systems training for the prime pilot and his alternate, who would be assigned to 
take turns in the capsule's contour couch. Then, if any modifications to the 
hardware or change in methods should become necessary, either man would be fully 
prepared to give valuable advice as well as to learn how the component change or 
new procedure would affect the mission. But by all accounts, as particularly 
ascribed to by the Mercury suborbital pilots, the best training sessions for 
practicing both normal and abnormal flight conditions in the Mercury program 
were those held in the procedures trainer. There all phases of a mission - 
prelaunch, countdown, launch, orbit, reentry, recovery, and emergency - could be 
simulated. The training planners decided that at least 30 hours of practice 
would be scheduled in this McDonnell-made trainer. On some occasions the 
simulation called for hooking the trainer in with the Mercury Control Center and 
the Bermuda tracking site, an exercise that also would help the flight 
controllers check, promulgate, or practice their communications and control 
procedures.
<P>[416] Voas and his colleagues scheduled numerous other training activities 
that would supposedly hone the astronauts to a fine edge. One such plan called 
for the pilot or his designated stand-in to attend the spacecraft scheduling 
meetings, operational planning sessions, and booster, spacecraft, and mission 
reviews. After the spacecraft had been mated with the booster, the astronaut 
would have a key role in the capsule systems test, sequential and abort 
exercises, and the simulated flight that accompanied each countdown launch 
simulation. With the astronaut sitting in the spacecraft, all countdown checks 
would be run up to the point of hatch installation. Voas' training document 
stipulated that even the exercise of slipping the pilot into his capsule should 
be practiced until the insertion crew had it down perfectly. Besides all this 
work at the Cape, preflight trips were planned to the Morehead Planetarium in 
North Carolina, so that the astronaut and his backup pilot could fix star 
patterns in their minds as an aid to their orbital celestial observations. To 
obtain a familiarity with angular motion, they would attend sessions in the 
Pensacola Naval Air Station's "rotating room" and on the human disorientation 
device. Egress training, the value of which Grissom vouched for after his 
harrowing recovery, was scheduled on the open water in the Atlantic. Finally, 
there were Morse code instruction, map study, and briefings by the Weather 
Bureau support team on observation procedures.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source10"><SUP>10</A></SUP>
<P>All these varied tasks had to be scheduled in logical progression to bring 
about a status of "flight readiness." The original training directive specified 
that an intensive training program for an upcoming flight should begin with a 
comprehensive study of all capsule instrumentation about 81 days before the 
launch was scheduled. Nine days later, after the astronaut and his alternate had 
memorized everything they could about the capsule instrument panel, they would 
start spending at least three hours per week in the procedures trainer, making 
brief excursions to Langley for sessions on the air-lubricated, free-axis (ALFA) 
trainer. In the procedures trainer they would go through specific mission 
profiles. These included a normal one-orbit mission, lasting about 90 minutes, 
with the astronaut in casual clothes; five-hour sessions simulating three 
orbits, with the astronaut wearing a pressure suit on some occasions; and 
30-minute abort simulations, including such hazards as the failure of the 
retropackage to jettison, failure of the spacecraft's main batteries shortly 
after orbital insertion, and many other malfunctions covering every conceivable 
contingency that the training officers could devise.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source11"><SUP>11</A></SUP>
<P>By December 1961, after Glenn and Carpenter had been publicly named for the 
Mercury-Atlas 6 mission, training plans were expanded to include their medical 
evaluations. For the altitude chamber simulated flight conducted about 45 to 60 
days before the anticipated launch, Glenn was examined, fitted with biosensors, 
suited, pressure-checked, and then loaded into the transfer van and medically 
observed during the trip to the altitude test chamber. After he seated himself 
in the couch, his biosensor data were checked, his electrocardiogram leads were 
monitored, and the newly fabricated blood pressure equipment was exercised. Also 
there was a checkout of the spacecraft's environmental control system.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source12"><SUP>12</A></SUP>
<P>[418]Jocelyn Gill also began planning the scientific aspects that Glenn might 
attend to while he was in orbit, when she called the first meeting of the ad hoc 
committee in Washington on December 1, 1961. William K. Douglas, Voas, and John 
J. Van Bockel attended from the Manned Spacecraft Center. The main purpose of 
this gathering was to adjust the suggestions emanating from the earlier meeting 
of the Astronomy Subcommittee into a workable order to provide the astronauts 
with as much background as possible of what they might expect to see in space. 
The first piece of equipment for scientific purposes aboard the spacecraft 
discussed was a small filter planned for use in studying the irregularities of 
the night-sky illumination and aurorae. For later missions an ultraviolet camera 
was suggested for possible use in photographing the stellar spectra.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source13"><SUP>13</A></SUP>
<P>Some eight days later Glenn, Carpenter, and Schirra accompanied Voas and 
Douglas to a second meeting called by Gill. Point by point the requested 
astronomical observations were explained to the three astronauts. Because of 
their evident interest, Gill was of the opinion that such briefings, perhaps 
with even more detailed information, should be provided at intervals as well as 
just before flight time.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source14"><SUP>14</A></SUP>
<P>During the month before the MA-6 mission, Glenn underwent at the launch site 
a realistic test termed "Pad Rehearsal No. 1." This exercise started with 
biosensor and suiting-up preparations at the hangar, transportation to the pad, 
and insertion of the astronaut into the spacecraft. Both the blockhouse and the 
Mercury Control Center were tied into and participated in this exercise. Several 
days later this operation was carried out again, and this time the gantry was 
pulled away to make conditions more realistic. Then about three days before the 
scheduled flight, after he had already begun his low-residue diet, Glenn went 
through a simulated mission encompassing the entire flight plan.
<P>Other preflight medical activities included a complete physical examination 
two days before the anticipated launch. The Mercury physicians issued Glenn a 
number of medications for his survival pack, including morphine for pain, 
mephentermine sulfate for shock, benzylamine hydrochloride for motion sickness, 
and racemic amphetamine sulfate (a common pep pill) for a stimulant. 
Radiation-measuring film packs were tucked inside the spacecraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source15"><SUP>15</A></SUP>
<P>Glenn and Carpenter had completed most of their preflight training program by 
the end of January, but the continuing delay of the MA-6 launch forced them to 
go on with their crowded routine. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the 
spacecraft during the hangar and altitude test chamber checks and uncounted 
hours on the pad after the launch rocket and spacecraft were mated. On the 
procedures trainer between December 13, 1961, and February 17, 1962, he logged 
59 hours and 45 minutes (far beyond the 30 required by the training directive) 
and worked through 70 simulated missions in the process, reacting to some 189 
simulated system failures. Glenn and Carpenter, along with Donald Slayton and 
Walter Schirra, already picked for MA-7, participated in a two-day (December 11 
and 13, 1961) recovery exercise on the Back River near Langley Air Force [419] 
Base, Virginia, easily making both top and side hatch exits. Later Glenn and 
Carpenter, wearing life vests, carried out a survival equipment exercise off the 
beach at Cape Canaveral.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source16"><SUP>16</A></SUP>
<P>Not only the pilots but many others were training for the MA-6 mission. On 
January 15, 16, and 17, 1962, recovery team swimmers practiced jumping from 
helicopters and placing the new auxiliary flotation collar around a boilerplate 
capsule. The flight controllers who were to deploy to the remote tracking sites 
got their final briefing on January 3 and left for their respective stations, 
where they engaged in seven rather extensive network exercises. Mercury Control, 
Goddard, and the Bermuda site conducted tests to check the Control 
Center-Bermuda abort command sequence. On January 25, Eugene F. Kranz reported 
to Christopher C. Kraft, the flight director, that the network team was at its 
peak condition. He feared that motivation and performance might decline if the 
flight continued to be delayed.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-2.htm#source17"><SUP>17</A></SUP>
<P>Although this was to be the first manned orbital flight in Project Mercury, 
earlier flights set many precedents in the planning process for such items as 
recovery requirements, mission rules, and test objectives, and consequently the 
mission planning for MA-6 was almost routine. The launch azimuth heading was to 
be the same that Enos had followed into orbit riding MA-5; the recovery forces, 
now thoroughly seasoned, although somewhat larger than for MA-5, were stationed 
to cover essentially the same landing areas; ignition procedures and range rules 
for the launch were about the same as on previous Mercury-Atlas missions.<A

program resulted partly from the loss of Grissom‘s spacecraft. It was also the 
product of two years' work, and credit for its design must go to Donald E. 
Stullken of the Pensacola Naval Air Station. Early in the Mercury program the 
engineers realized that their hope of adapting a 20-man life raft to keep a 
spacecraft afloat was not feasible. The "Stullken collar" passed its final test 
on Jan. 3, 1962. At that time 50 collars had been made at Pensacola and 
delivered to the recovery forces. In an earlier test, off Wallops Island, one of 
the collars had kept the MR-2 capsule afloat for 70 hours in waves up to 7 feet 
high. The collar was made of five-ply life-raft fabric, was attached to the 
spacecraft by cables around the impact skirt, and was inflated after attachment. 
Stullken later became an employee of the Manned Spacecraft Center. <I>Space News

that as a safety measure the ground track was set to continue 1,000 miles beyond 
the third orbit landing area and that the explosive egress hatch had been
