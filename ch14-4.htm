<H1>The Textbook Flight</H1>As October 3, 1962, dawned, television viewers and 
radio listeners in the United States faced the day with a spectacular 
doubleheader in store: in the new "world series" in space, the orbiting of a 
third American; in the older World Series on Earth, the opening baseball game 
between the New York Yankees and the San Francisco Giants. Many dials switched 
later in the day to the traditional nine-inning sports event, but two of the 
three major networks continued to compete for the attention of Americans with 
minute-by-minute coverage of <I>Sigma 7</I>'s six orbits.<A

<P>Schirra slipped into his capsule, buckled himself comfortably in the couch, 
and smiled when he saw an automobile ignition key hanging from the 
handcontroller safety latch. This represented a tension breaker provided by the 
ground crew. Then he began to inventory his gear inside the cabin - flight-plan 
bar charts neatly placed in a slot just below the instrument panel, star charts 
arranged in a rack to his side, cameras in place, and accessories stowed in his 
ditty bag. When he stuck his hand in the glove compartment, he found some 
crinkly plastic wrapped around a soft object that turned out to be a steak 
sandwich. Otherwise, everything was as it should be, and Schirra began his 
prelaunch checkout tests.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-4.htm#source26"><SUP>26</A></SUP>
<P>Outside the spacecraft, technicians busily bolted on the side hatch, and 
every bolt sank neatly in its threads. From there on, the countdown proceeded 
rapidly until about 6:15 (T minus 45 minutes), when the Canary Island station 
reported a malfunction in one of its radar sets. Since this equipment would be 
critical in ascertaining the orbital parameters, Williams quickly called a hold 
in the countdown. The Canary radar required only 15 minutes to be fixed and for 
the next 45 minutes the countdown ticked off with precision.
<P>[473] At 7:15 a.m., the engines of Atlas 113-D roared and the big booster 
rose from the pad to rocket Schirra and <I>Sigma 7</I> on their journey through 
space. "I have the lift-off," Schirra shouted into his microphone to Slayton in 
the Mercury Control Center, "and she feels real nice." Ten seconds above the 
pad, however, No. 113-D telemetered signals showing an unexpected clockwise 
roll. Both primary and secondary sensors inside the launch vehicle, monitoring 
such movements to determine the seriousness of the situation, registered a 
rifling roll only 20 percent short of an abort condition. Then, to the relief of 
the capsule and booster monitors in the control center, the threatening twist 
suddenly smoothed out. Schirra began transmitting the status of his supplies and 
systems' operation. After a little more than a minute, he realized that he 
seemed to be talking to himself. Glancing around the cockpit, he noted that 
evidently the noise associated with max q had incorrectly operated the 
sound-activated radio microphone, and so he pushed the button to talk to 
Slayton. Surely something should be done to obviate this problem, he thought, 
because he needed to keep his hand on the abort handle, or "chicken switch," 
rather than having to press the "talk" button manually.
<P>Schirra listened for booster engine cutoff; it came two seconds earlier than 
programmed. He saw a flash of light and smoke reflected from the booster engines 
at the time the aft section parted from the sustainer. Seconds later the escape 
tower jerked away from the top of <I>Sigma 7</I>, its rocket blast spreading a 
spotty film on the window. Sustainer engine acceleration seemed slow, Schirra 
mused, but since his escape tower had "really said 'sayonara,' " he could only 
wait and see if the sustainer would burn long enough to accelerate him into 
orbit. Acceleration seemed to drive on and on, the pilot said, and finally the 
sustainer engine cut off, about 10 seconds late. Data registered on the control 
panels at the Cape indicated a 15-foot-per-second overspeed that would send 
Schirra higher - 176 miles - and faster - 17,557 miles per hour - than any other 
astronaut had gone or would go during Project Mercury.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-4.htm#source27"><SUP>27</A></SUP>
<P>When <I>Sigma 7</I> parted from its Atlas rocket, Schirra turned on the 
auxiliary damping controls to eliminate the spacecraft quivers produced by the 
blast of the posigrade rockets. Although he dearly wanted to look out the 
spacecraft window at the scene below, Schirra fixed his eyes on the instrument 
panel, flipped his attitude control to the fly-by-wire mode, and started a 
leisurely four-degree-per-second cartwheel movement to obtain his correct 
orbital attitude position. Turnaround, which was deliberately slow to conserve 
fuel, used only three-tenths of a pound from a total supply of almost 59 pounds 
of hydrogen peroxide. To Schirra the thruster jets operated as if they had been 
programmed by a computer, providing tiny single pulse spurts to obtain exactly 
the position he desired.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-4.htm#source28"><SUP>28</A></SUP>
<P>Now he could look out the window to track the sustainer tankage. Peering at a 
prescribed spot, Schirra saw the spent vehicle come into view in the upper left 
corner of his "picture" window, just as his predecessors had said it should. 
Glenn and Carpenter had mentioned that their tankage appeared to be silvery in 
color; to Schirra, his looked almost black, "with a white belly band of frost." 
[474] The spent launch vehicle seemed to have completed the same turnaround 
maneuver as the spacecraft, because Schirra looked down its nozzle. <I>The Sigma 
7</I> pilot saw none of the ice crystals or contrails streaming from the tankage 
reported by Carpenter.
<P>Schirra said that the fly-by-wire system that had been redesigned to use only 
the low thrusters, if desired, served well to adjust his attitude to track the 
spent sustainer. The thrusters responded crisply and cut off without residual 
reactions. Tracking the booster seemed even easier than following a target in an 
aircraft on an air-to-air gunnery problem. Schirra nevertheless knew that he had 
neither the attitude control and maneuvering thrust nor the computational 
ability to perform a rendezvous. There were simply too many conditions to be 
judged if he were to solve the orbital mechanics task so shortly after 
launching. Schirra later expressed the opinion that rendezvous with another 
vehicle in space appeared to be possible, but that he believed a pilot would 
have to have very precise attitude data to effect a coupling. He confirmed what 
students of celestial mechanics already knew, while providing them with a feel 
for the problems of perceiving relative motion. Differences in velocity of only 
20 to 30 feet per second between two objects in space could be disastrous, he 
said.
<P>As Schirra neared the Canary Islands, he turned aside from tracking the 
booster to check out the manual-proportional mode of spacecraft control. The 
pitching-up maneuver matched well with his experience on the procedures trainer. 
As Grissom had done before him in Mercury-Redstone 4, Schirra noted that he 
tended to overshoot his desired attitude position and that the manual mode of 
control seemed "sloppy" compared with the semi-automatic modes. 
Manual-proportional control clearly was not the best way to "park" the 
spacecraft in one attitude. A far better method, he learned, was to rely on 
fly-by-wire with low thrusters only.
<P>Passing over Nigeria, Schirra transferred spacecraft control to the automatic 
stabilization and control system and busily monitored his panel dials. Minutes 
later he had traversed the African continent without yielding more than once to 
the temptation to watch the panorama passing beneath him. Moving toward 
Zanzibar, Schirra began to feel warm. He decided to devote full attention to 
this before somebody, as he said later in the postflight debriefing, started 
"jumping up and down in the control center" and yanked him out of orbit. Frank 
H. Samonski, the environmental control system monitor in the Mercury Control 
Center, had also watched the temperature rise. At Mercury Control the suit heat 
signal, creeping steadily upward, had indeed caused the ground controllers to 
think about terminating the mission after the first circuit. Samonski conferred 
with Charles A. Berry, who had relieved Stanley C. White as flight surgeon in 
the Control Center. Berry believed that the astronaut was in good condition. He 
advised trying a second orbit to see if the suit and its occupant could settle 
their temperature differences. Kraft, the flight director, listened to the two 
men and decided to give the go-ahead to Schirra for a second orbit. Wrestling 
with communications checks and with his suit temperature, he found himself 
halfway around the world before the Guaymas station relayed the official green 
light for his second orbit.
<P>[475] When the temperature problem first appeared, the control knob setting 
was at Position 4. Prior to the flight, Schirra had established a procedure for 
just this situation. Rather than rushing to a high setting, he slowly advanced 
the knob by half a mark at a time, then waited about 10 minutes to evaluate the 
change. Had the valve been advanced too quickly, the heat exchanger might have 
frozen and reduced its effectiveness even more. By the time Position 7 was 
reached, Schirra was much cooler and felt sure that his temperature problem was 
nearing resolution, but for good measure he turned to Position 8. Shortly he 
became a little cool, and Samonski recommended that he return to Position 3.5. 
Schirra, thinking that some kind of analysis had been performed in the Mercury 
Control Center, complied. Immediately noting that the temperature was rising 
again, he quickly returned the setting to 7.5 and left it alone for a while.
<P>Rounding Muchea, Australia, on his first pass, Schirra had nosed the small 
end of <I>Sigma 7</I> down to watch for the first ground flare launch. He said 
that he saw the flare before realizing the flash was only lightning. Shortly 
thereafter, Woomera reported flare ignition; the pilot still saw lightning - but 
only as a big blob of light, never like the jagged streaks seen nearer Earth. 
Again, as on past missions, the flare launching area was cloaked by clouds. 
Minutes later, however, he reported seeing the outline of a city, which he 
guessed to be Brisbane, Australia.
<P>With careful adjustments, Schirra peered into the periscope on his first 
night trip through space, endeavoring to prove its optical advantages. Very 
graphically, he finally reported, "I couldn't see schmatze through it. Schmatze 
translated means nothing." He, like Carpenter, found the periscope was excess 
baggage during the daytime and nearly useless at night. Reaching the morning 
side of Earth near Hawaii, he recoiled when the Sun, glaring through the scope, 
almost blinded him. Placing a chart over the scope, he commented that it "helps 
no end to cover up that blasted periscope."
<P>Though he did not feel rushed in his few tasks, Schirra did notice a 
remarkable "speeding up of time" as distance flew by so rapidly. After crossing 
the Pacific, he reported to Scott Carpenter at Guaymas, Mexico, "I'm in chimp 
configuration," meaning that the capsule systems were all on automatic and 
working beautifully. Even the temperature range had now become more comfortable, 
and one more adjustment of the knob would end that problem. He then told 
Carpenter that he would soon start his first daytime yaw maneuver, using the 
window as a reference. Schirra said to Slayton, while sailing over the Cape, 
that the "reticle is working well for yaw, as well as for almost any other 
attitude." Any object that could be seen on Earth could be centered on the 
window reticle long enough to judge yaw misalignment. Always the most difficult 
of the three axes to judge precisely, as demonstrated during MA-7, yaw alignment 
with the flight path was a major control task to be tested by the MA-8 mission. 
Over areas of extreme cloudiness, there was no worry so long as rifts or 
thunderheads provided breaks in the blanket of cloud cover. By the end of his 
first circuit, Schirra felt he had become so adept in determining yaw attitude 
that he could [476] estimate any yaw angle his ship happened to take away from 
the flight path.
<P>The pilot for a second time carefully compared his visual ability, both with 
and without the periscope, to position the capsule's attitude correctly. He felt 
satisfied with the results. He conceded that by using the periscope on high 
magnification he could obtain the yaw attitude faster than with the window, but 
speed was unnecessary in most cases.
<P>Schirra had to devote much of his time during the first orbit and a good 
portion of the second to correcting his suit temperature settings. Perspiration 
salted around his mouth as a result of suit inlet temperature reaching 82 
degrees F; he became quite thirsty, but he resisted opening the visor so the 
suit could have every opportunity to settle in a more comfortable range. Despite 
the heat - which he described as comparable to what he had endured mowing his 
lawn in Texas on a summer's day - all other aspects of the flight were going 
well. <I>Sigma 7</I> had consumed 1.4 pounds of fuel on the first orbit, Schirra 
noted as he reported the status of the spacecraft systems. He saw the exterior 
particles first reported by Glenn and tapped the cabin wall to obtain the same 
shower effect Carpenter reported. Much of his conversation with the tracking 
sites involved the status of his suit circuit. He seemed to enjoy talking with 
the communicators during his first orbit, but later he would complain that this 
became a chore, especially when he was trying to concentrate on his work.
<P>On Earth's nightside, Schirra reported that the Moon made an excellent yaw 
reference; after completing and reporting on the yaw maneuver, Schirra told 
Slayton in the Mercury Control Center that he had shifted back to the automatic 
system. By now the temperature had subsided enough to permit a quick drink of 
water. He took the opportunity during this respite to report that all systems 
were performing very well. So far he had felt only one unwanted spurt from a 
24-pound thruster when he returned to fly-by-wire for a yaw-maneuver exercise. 
Becoming a little bored with automatic flight halfway around the world, Schirra 
shifted to the manual- proportional system and produced a similar moment of 
double authority. About two percent of the manual supply spat out in a pitchdown 
motion of the spacecraft. "It was my boo-boo," he confessed.
<P>Over Muchea, Australia, on his second pass, Schirra began a more serious and 
considerably more difficult night-yaw experiment. He was to test his ability to 
use celestial navigation to align the spacecraft properly. Using star-finder 
charts, Schirra was supposed to orient himself by positioning <I>Sigma 7</I> in 
relation to known stars or planets and the Moon. Then he was to test his sense 
of facing to the right or left of his flight path by watching the apparent 
motions of heavenly bodies. The pilot found that the airglow layer was an 
excellent reference for pitch and roll. This belt, which appeared very thick 
above the horizon, could provide reference for these attitudes quite accurately. 
For experimentation with the airglow layer, he positioned <I>Sigma 7</I> so that 
it appeared to aim at the upper layer of the belt. The panel indicators then 
showed a zero reference in pitch.
<P>[477] Schirra conceded that night-yaw reference could be a bit of a problem. 
The field of view from the window did not make it easy to identify the 
constellations and find a known star. Preferring to obtain the correct yaw 
reference on the daylight side, Schirra seemed to lack confidence in his ability 
to effect the night maneuver. To some degree his difficulty stemmed from his 
star-finder charts, which had been fixed in their relationship to Earth for a 
period up to about 7:16 a.m. on October 3. Schirra, now deep into the second 
orbit, knew that his launch time had been 7:15. The difference in time, plus his 
restricted field of view, reduced the value of this night-yaw exercise; but as 
it turned out, telemetry data received at the Muchea tracking station showed his 
error to be only four degrees.
<P>During the night-yaw maneuver, Schirra happened to notice one excellent 
celestial pattern that he could use to align the spacecraft in the retrofire 
position when it was time to reenter the atmosphere. Checking the panel 
indicators against his own observations, he determined that the correct 
retrofire attitude would place the planet Jupiter in the upper right-hand corner 
of the window, the double-star constellation Grus tracking in from the left side 
of the window, and the star Fomalhaut at the top of the window, near the center.
<P>Across the Pacific, Schirra again placed the controls in the automatic, or 
"chimp configuration," mode. He chatted with Grissom at the Hawaiian site about 
how well the spacecraft's systems were working. Grissom had made some rather 
strong points concerning the manual-proportional control operation during his 
suborbital flight, and the two astronauts, in a space-to-Earth conversation, 
compared notes. Just as Hawaii lost his signal and California picked it up, 
Schirra called that the "fireflies" were coming into view. "I have a delightful 
report for one John Glenn," he told the California communicator. "I do see 
fireflies." Impressed by the view out of the window, even though much of the 
California coast was covered with clouds, Schirra remarked to Glenn, "It's kind 
of hard to describe all this, isn't it, John?" Suddenly, through rifts in the 
clouds, he could see San Clemente Island, off the coastline. Then, looking 
northeastward, he saw more of the coastal area come into view, followed by the 
Salton Sea, an excellent view of lower California, the ridges of Mount Whitney, 
and several roads in the Mojave Desert area.
<P>Although Schirra flew higher than either Glenn or Carpenter, he was rather 
unimpressed by the height of his voyage. Psychologically he had prepared himself 
for space flight, knowing that he would be flying 10 times higher than he had 
ever flown before. But once in space, the number, size, and detail of the 
objects he could see with the unaided eye, such as roads and terrain changes, 
made him actually feel no higher than he had climbed in an aircraft. "Same old 
deal, nothing new," he remarked in debriefing, "might as well be in an airplane 
at 40- to 50-thousand feet altitude."
<P>According to his flight plan, if the yaw-reference checks had been 
satisfactory <I>Sigma 7</I> would be phased into drifting flight during the 
third orbit. [478] After giving Slayton a systems status report, Schirra 
proceeded to cage the spacecraft's gyros, cut off its electrical power, and 
allow <I>Sigma 7</I> to drift through space. Schirra took this opportunity to 
make an old psychomotor experiment that Robert B. Voas a year earlier had asked 
to be performed. Choosing three dials on the control panel, he closed his eyes 
and attempted to touch the target points. In a total of nine trials, he made 
only three errors, the largest being a displacement of some two inches. The 
weightless state, he concluded, created no disorientation or new problems in 
blindly reaching for his controls.
<P>After that test, Schirra drifted along, reporting his status again to the 
Canary station and enjoying a brief period of looking out the window. He 
mentioned that his outer pane was streaked with a pinkish-orange film and 
surmised that this had emanated from the exhaust gases of the launch escape 
rocket. According to his flight plan, he was supposed to eat and drink now; 
although he said, "I'm having a ball up here drifting," eat and drink he did - 
peaches and ground beef mush from squeeze tubes.
<P>Out over the Indian Ocean, he informed the tracking ship in that vicinity 
that he had switched the electrical power back on and gone into fly-by-wire 
control to check systems operations after the "powered down," or free-flight, 
period. Excitedly, the Indian Ocean ship communicator told Schirra that some of 
the crew topside had actually caught sight of <I>Sigma 7</I> for five minutes 
and through nine degrees of tracking. Schirra, quite pleased, said, "I'll have 
to go by and say hello." The pilot then reported that powering up again 
presented no difficulty; all systems worked beautifully, with absolutely no 
responses from the high thrusters. Smoothly transferring into the automatic 
stabilization and control system, he began to look toward the heavens for 
familiar stars. When the Moon failed to show, he went to the fly-by-wire, 
low-thruster control to bring it into sight. He identified Cassiopeia during the 
process, then said, "There's our friend the Moon." Over Muchea again by this 
time, he told the communicator that he had locked the automatic system onto the 
disk of the Moon. Mercury Control had alerted the ground stations to pay 
particular attention to fuel usage by the thrusters. Canton Island and Kauai, 
Hawaii, rolled by underneath with everything working so well that Grissom, at 
the Hawaiian station, gave Schirra the official good news that he had a "go" for 
the full six orbits.
<P>As <I>Sigma 7</I> came near the California tracking site on its third pass, 
Schirra told Glenn, "I'm going to shove off for a relaxation period," meaning he 
would cut his electrical power, cage his gyros, and start drifting again. 
Schirra's flight schedule now called for experimental observations and 
photography. He had to struggle getting the camera out of the ditty bag, but 
once out it was weightless, and Schirra easily snapped pictures from Baja, 
California to Cuba as <I>Sigma 7</I> drifted along beautifully. Nearing the 
Cape, Slayton asked for a radiation reading from the hand-held dosimeter. 
Schirra replied that the value was so small that it was nearly unreadable. Then 
Kraft himself came on the air to compliment Schirra, to urge him to look for the 
giant Echo balloon-shaped satellite on his next pass over [479] Zanzibar, and to 
notify him that his voice would be broadcast live for two minutes during his 
next flight across North America. The enthusiastic pilot then exclaimed that he 
had just drifted into an inverted position (head to Earth) and "for some reason 
or another, you can tell that the bowl [spacecraft] is upside down." He saw the 
whole eastern coastline of the United States, took a picture of that, and then 
another of an interesting cloud formation. Still complaining that the camera was 
difficult to extract, he decided not to stow it in the case for a while. As for 
Echo, he never saw that (or any other) man-made satellite while in orbit.
<P>Floating through space around the world on his fourth orbit, Schirra took 
pictures that struck his fancy, watched the nightfall, recognized several stars 
as they appeared, and looked at lightning in the thunderstorms covering portions 
of the Australian continent. As he came over the Pacific command ship, he 
facetiously reported to Shepard that his hydrogen peroxide had not evaporated 
and suggested that they should make some plans, the next time around, about 
retrofire countdown. Schirra then tuned on the radar ships <I>Huntsville</I> and 
<I>Watertown</I> for a communications check. As Hawaii was sliding by, he told 
Grissom that he was in inverted flight and that the impression was similar to 
"looking out a railroad train window. You see the terrain going by you." The yaw 
attitude of the spacecraft was clearly discernible against this background.
<P>As he approached, head down and looking toward California on his fourth pass, 
Schirra joked with Glenn about his "real weird attitude" and transmitted another 
short status report. Then at 6 hours, 8 minutes, and 4 seconds elapsed time from 
launch, Schirra and Glenn began a dialogue heard by much of the Western world 
via radio and television: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>GLENN:</B> Okay, Sigma 7. This is Cal Cap Com. You're at 6:08. 
  Two minutes on live TV. Go ahead, Wally.
  <P><B>SCHIRRA:</B> Roger, John. Just came out of a powered-down configuration 
  where we had the ASCS inverter off. It came up in good shape and will stay on 
  now for the rest of the flight. The amps and volts are reading properly.... 
  I'm coming toward you inverted this time, which is an unusual way for any of 
  us to approach California, I'll admit.
  <P><B>GLENN:</B> Roger, Wally. You got anything to say to everyone watching 
  you across the country on this thing? We're going out live on this.
  <P><B>SCHIRRA:</B> That sounds like great sport. I can see why you and Scott 
  like it. I'm having a trick now. I'm looking at the United States and starting 
  to pitch up slightly with this drifting rate. And I see the moon, which I'm 
  sure no one in the United States can see as well as I right now.
  <P><B>GLENN:</B> I think you're probably right
  <P><B>SCHIRRA:</B> Ha-ha, I suppose an old song, "Drifting and Dreaming," 
  would be apropos at this point, but at this point I don't have a chance to 
  dream. I'm enjoying it too much.
  <P><B>GLENN:</B> Things are looking real good from here, Wally.
  <P><B>SCHIRRA:</B> Thank you, John. I guess that what I'm doing right now is 
  sort of a couple of Immelmanns across the United States.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>[480] 
And here ended Schirra's epistle from space. Glenn continued the conversation in 
relative privacy, asking whether Schirra had noticed anything surprising about 
the haze layer. Schirra replied with another understatement - "It's quite 
fascinating" - but later he recalled that this phenomenon had been his biggest 
spatial surprise. Both Glenn and Carpenter had briefed him on the night view of 
the horizon from the heavens, but "it just never did sink in to me that it was 
as large in magnitude as it really was." Schirra remarked that the airglow layer 
covered about a quarter of his view out the window. When first sighted, he said, 
"I thought it was clouds, until stars appeared below."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-4.htm#source29"><SUP>29</A></SUP>
<P>Halfway through the fourth orbit, liquid collected over the inner surface of 
his helmet faceplate, evidently from the water coolant circuit. Although Schirra 
was annoyed by this problem for the next two hours, he was thankful that the 
suit temperature remained reasonably comfortable. So long as his visor was 
sealed, he had to crane his head about inside the helmet to find a clear view 
out of the faceplate. He was still reluctant to disturb his suit temperature by 
opening his visor to wipe it clean.
<P>Going into his fifth orbit, Schirra told Slayton by radio relay that the 
flight had been his first opportunity to relax since the previous December. His 
life had suddenly become so sedentary that he gladly used the bungee cord 
exerciser to tone up his muscles a bit. "Not exactly walking around," he said, 
"but a little bit of stretching." Because <I>Sigma 7</I> was now over the 
Yucatan Peninsula, communications with the Cape were a little strained, causing 
Slayton to quiz Schirra, "Did you say you'd like to get up and walk around?" The 
ground controllers cleared the matter by switching circuits to a relay 
communications aircraft.
<P>Schirra now began another check of the manual-proportional attitude controls, 
recording a third brief instance of double authority control. Regarding this 
latest spew of fuel, he complained that he "really flotched it. It's much too 
easy to get into double authority, even with the tremendous logic you have 
working on all these systems." His check of all the axes of movement proved that 
the manual-proportional system was still in good working order. After this trial 
he returned to observing and photographing targets of opportunity.
<P>As he prepared to look for the 140-million candlepower light near Durban, 
South Africa, Schirra reported "getting some lighted areas over the southern tip 
of Africa. . . . I definitely have a city in sight." Betting that this was Port 
Elizabeth, a city a little more than 300 miles to the southwest of Durban, 
Schirra did not seem surprised that Durban was being drenched with rain and its 
brilliant light was not visible on this pass.
<P>Passing into its fifth revolution of Earth, <I>Sigma 7</I> still performed 
beautifully in all respects. Astronaut Schirra had little to tell the ground 
tracking station except to repeat how well the systems were working and how 
gorgeous were the sights. With each orbit, he was now moving farther from the 
beaten track nominal to a three-pass flight, and the periods of silence were 
longer. A lighted area appearing much like an airport showed up in what he 
surmised were the [481] Philippine Islands. "Possibly it's at Zamboanga," he 
guessed, a city on the southwest coast of Mindanao. Minutes later he talked with 
Alan B. Shepard aboard the Pacific command ship, reporting with pleasure that 
his fuel supply stood at 81 and 80 percent in the automatic and manual tanks, 
respectively. His oxygen supply was properly pressurized, and his suit 
temperature was at a comfortable 62 degrees. Shepard replied, "Well, I could say 
that you were definitely go." Quickly he checked in with the <I>Huntsville</I> 
and <I>Watertown</I>, presenting, as he put it, a "hunky dory" report. As the 
pilot came over the Kauai station, Grissom fed him the correct retrosequence 
time that he should use on his next, and final, pass. Checks with Glenn at Point 
Arguello and with Carpenter at Guaymas showed that communications should be good 
for checkoff and reentry during the sixth orbit. Schirra then bade farewell to 
South America with a "Buenos dias, you-all," to the Quito, Ecuador, 
communications relay station.
<P>Going into the sixth orbit, Schirra almost regretfully began his preparations 
to return to Earth. On his last pass over South America, heavy cloud coverage 
obscured most of the hemisphere but he did catch sight of a large winding river. 
He reached for the slow-scan camera and pointed it downward at the surface of 
the window to capture the view, making a panoramic shot of the continent that he 
thought would aid the Weather Bureau in continental cloud analyses. Then he 
stowed the camera, rearranged the contents of the ditty bag and glove 
compartment, and began going down the checklist of actions to be accomplished 
before retrofire and reentry.
<P>He shifted the control mode from the automatic system to the fly- by-wire, 
low-thrusters, and found his command of the system still worked well. He looked 
briefly out the window for the lights of Durban, but clouds still hid the glow 
of that huge lamp from sight. He closed the faceplate, found it fogging again, 
and opened it briefly to wipe the visor clean. The instrument panel showed that 
the inverter temperatures were in a good range, that the battery voltage checked 
out high, and that the oxygen pressure was holding its mark. Although quite 
comfortable, he decided to advance the suit-circuit knob "just a tad to increase 
the cooling for reentry," to Position 8. The checkoff proceeded so methodically 
that he had time to try another eyes-closed orientation test. He reached for the 
manual handle and felt it in his grasp. Then he reached for the emergency handle 
but brushed an adjacent radio box before touching it.
<P>Down below, the Indian Ocean ship communicator asked if he needed any help in 
completing the pre-retrosequence checklist. "Negative," he replied. All was in 
readiness for the last-minute arming of the retrorocket squibs. He waited and 
watched until he came in range of Shepard aboard the Pacific command ship. In 
the darkness, he viewed a moonset, saw the proper star and planet pattern for 
his correctly aligned attitude swing into view, and noticed that one of his 
fingertip lights had burned out. Musing out loud for whoever could listen, he 
likened his situation once again to riding a train on celestial tracks leading 
back toward Earth. Listening to the humming of the systems, he was reminded also 
of a ship underway [482] at sea. As a pilot, Schirra curiously refused to 
compare his limited control of the spacecraft with his freedom of maneuver in 
aircraft.
<P>When he came into range of the Pacific command ship, he glanced at the fuel 
levels: 78 percent in both the automatic and manual tanks, the meters read. 
Shepard asked him how he stood on the checklist. Completed, with the exception 
of arming the rocket squibs, Schirra replied. He told Shepard that his ship was 
holding well in the retroattitude mode on the automatic system, that the high 
thrusters were in good working order, and that he had the manual-proportional 
system in a standby position. With everything set, Shepard gave the countdown to 
arm the squibs on the "Mark!" Next came the retrosequence countdown. Eight hours 
and 52 minutes after <I>Sigma 7</I> lifted off from the Cape, the first 
retrorocket fired. When Schirra punched the button for this action, the tiny 
instant of time before the firing "seemed agonizingly long." As each retrorocket 
fired crisply at five-second intervals, Schirra was pleasantly amazed that the 
spacecraft appeared to hold as steady as a rock. Quickly he checked this 
impression with a glance out of the window; the star pattern he could see did 
not even appear to quiver. After retrofire he checked the automatic fuel gauge 
and found the needle hovering between 52 and 53 percent.
<P>Then Schirra shifted gears to his favorite fly-by-wire, low-thruster mode of 
control. He armed the retropack jettison switch and the spent unit spun away. 
Shortly after retrofire his attitude control felt "a little bit sloppy," and he 
felt himself wobble toward reentry. Although this could have been corrected by 
using the low thrusters, he intentionally cut in the high thrusters to get into 
position quickly. Schirra pitched <I>Sigma 7</I> up to the 14-degree reentry 
attitude with no difficulty and cut in the automatic control mode to damp away 
undesirable motions. Then, as the engineers had asked him to do, he turned on 
the fuel-gulping rate stabilization control system (RSCS). His return to the 
atmosphere was "thrilling" to the astronaut. He said the sky and Earth's surface 
really began to brighten, but, most surprisingly, the "bear" he rode felt "as 
stable as an airplane."
<P>Schirra realized that he had heard none of the hissing noises reported by 
Glenn and Carpenter. Possibly, he thought, his concentration on the rate control 
system caused him to miss the sounds. Having conserved his hydrogen peroxide so 
well thus far, Schirra was quite perturbed with the rate system because he could 
see the fuel supply being dumped like water being flushed. Resisting the 
temptation to switch to a more economical mode of control because the engineers 
wanted to evaluate this system once and for all, he pulled his eyes away from 
the gauge and looked out the window. He could see the green glow from air 
friction that Carpenter had reported. To him it looked limeade in color, almost 
chartreuse. Suddenly, as a three-foot strap flopped past the window, he 
exclaimed, "My gosh!" Then he remembered, "That's the same thing John saw."
<P>Soon the barometric altimeter dial came into operation, and Schirra calmly 
waited for the needle to edge toward the 40,000-foot reading. He punched the 
drogue button, heard a "strong thrumming," and then felt the drogue parachute 
pop open. [483] What had felt like a smooth highway now seemed like turning off 
on "a bumpy road." As long as he could, the astronaut strained to watch "the 
drogue up there pounding away," but the window became virtually occluded by 
smoky deposits from reentry. Schirra then turned back and flipped on the fuel 
jettison switch.
<P>At the 15,000-foot mark he ejected the main parachute and saw it stream and 
blossom at 10,500 feet. This event, as Schirra quipped, "sort of put the cap on 
the whole thing." As he started his descent to Earth, Schirra remarked to 
Shepard, "I think they're gonna put me on the number 3 elevator" of the carrier 
<I>Kearsarge</I>. <I>Sigma 7</I> missed this mark by a scant 4.5 miles downrange 
from the planned landing point, but the recovery force had the spacecraft well 
within its sights electronically and visually. The carrier made radar contact 
with <I>Sigma 7</I> at a slant-range of 202 miles; 90 miles uprange from the 
carrier, sailors of the destroyer <I>Renshaw</I> reported hearing a sonic boom. 
Men on the deck of the <I>Kearsarge</I> then saw a contrail, while a few of its 
crew claimed to see the drogue and others heard two successive sonic booms and 
saw the main chute unfurl. After nine hours and 13 minutes in flight, <I>Sigma 7 
</I>settled on the water, in full view of the ship's crew and the cameras of 
newsmen.
<P><I>Sigma 7</I> hit the surface with a "plop," as Schirra described it, and 
"went way down" before it surfaced and floated. He waited patiently for 45 
seconds and then broke off the main parachute and switched on the recovery aids. 
Inside, the spacecraft remained dry and the temperature range was very 
comfortable as <I>Sigma 7</I> rode the lazy ocean swells. This condition 
prompted the pilot to exaggerate in debriefing that he "could stay in there 
forever, if necessary." Through the window he could see the green dye permeating 
the water in a widening perimeter, and he knew that the whip antenna had 
telescoped out fully. Seeing the antenna pole deploy while <I>Sigma 7</I> was 
still submerged, Schirra later joked that he thought he might spear another 
bluefish. All was well, and so far as this test pilot could judge, the Mercury 
spacecraft "had gone to the top of the list," even over the F8F aircraft he 
liked so well.
<P>Long before Schirra's splashdown, the <I>Kearsarge</I> had launched 
helicopters with swimmer teams, and soon three swimmers jumped into the dye 
beside the floating capsule. During the 30 seconds while he was keeled over in 
the water, Schirra had had some trepidation about his watertight integrity. He 
momentarily wished for the pressure regulator handle that had been deleted from 
<I>Sigma 7</I> to save another pound of weight. As the capsule righted itself 
and remained shipshape, he noticed that communications had been better with 
Hawaii than they were with the <I>Kearsarge</I>. The pararescue men then cut the 
whip antenna and attached the flotation collar around the heatshield. Since he 
was comfortable, he radioed a request to the helicopter pilot that he "would 
prefer to stay in and have a small boat come alongside" and tow him to the 
carrier's cranes. Five men piled into a motor whaleboat and within minutes had 
covered the half-mile to the bobbing <I>Sigma 7</I> and attached a tow line to 
it.
<P>[484] Some nine hours and 54 minutes after launch, the small space ship was 
hoisted aboard the huge carrier. Five minutes later Schirra whacked the plunger 
to blow the explosive hatch, incurring the same kind of superficial hand injury 
as Glenn before him. He stepped out onto the deck of the <I>Kearsarge</I> and 
paused to acknowledge the jubilant shouts and applause of the ship's crew. As he 
walked down to the ship's sick bay, Schirra looked tired and hot but happy. When 
reporters called out, "How do you feel, Wally?" he replied, "Fine," with a flip 
of the hand.
<P>For the next three days, the <I>Kearsarge</I> was to be his home during the 
medical examinations and technical debriefings. While still in his space suit 
and sitting on a cot in the officers' sickroom, he received successive 
congratulatory telephone calls from President Kennedy, his wife Josephine 
Schirra, and Vice President Johnson.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-4.htm#source30"><SUP>30</A></SUP>
<P>Richard A. Pollard of MSC, Commander Max Trummer of the Navy, and several 
other physicians began to check Schirra in every medical way possible. When his 
phone calls were completed, about 45 minutes after he came on board, the 
systematic examinations began. At first appearance, the spaceman showed no 
evidence that he was dizzy or required walking assistance. He told the 
physicians, "I feel fine. It was a textbook flight. The flight went just the way 
I wanted it to." Contrary to the impression of some newsmen, the physicians did 
not find Schirra overly fatigued. He talked easily and actively assisted in his 
postflight physical. Only after he had been strapped on a tilt table did several 
unusual symptoms begin to appear. For example, when lying supine his heartbeat 
averaged 70 a minute; standing, it rose to 100. Blood pressure readings, 
although not so pronounced in range, registered differently in standing, 
sitting, and prone positions. His legs and feet assumed a dusky, reddish-purple 
color when Schirra stood up, connoting that his veins were engorged. This 
condition persisted for about six hours, and then the astronaut was permitted to 
retire for the night. The next morning Schirra's heart and blood pressure 
readings were near normal, and there was no evidence of pooling of blood in his 
legs when he stood.
<P>Other than this minor anomaly, and the small lesion on his hand, Schirra 
seemed none the worse for his lengthy weightless sojourn in space. Life-systems 
specialists in NASA, at McDonnell, and at AiResearch, however, had another 
question: What caused the elevated suit temperatures during the first two 
orbits? Postflight inspectors dug into the matter promptly. The technical ills 
of the spacecraft's systems were more easily determined than the subtleties of 
man's physiological system; as it turned out, the flow in the suit coolant 
circuit had been impeded by the silicone lubricant on a needle valve's having 
dried out and flaked.
<P>Postflight inspection of <I>Sigma 7</I> found little else that seemed out of 
the ordinary. Circular cracks on the ablation shield were moderately larger than 
on Glenn's and Carpenter's spacecraft; also it appeared that the shield had 
banged into the fiber-glass protective bulkhead upon impact, causing several 
small holes. Once again the heatshield showed some delamination from the center, 
but it still [486] appeared, as in past flights, that this occurred after 
reentry. Char depth on the shield, about a third of an inch, was quite nominal. 
The shield's center plug, which had been loose or missing after previous 
missions, stayed tightly in place. All in all, the inspectors found very few 
problems to analyze or to correct. The quality of the mission, of the hardware, 
of the software, of procedures, and of the pilot were all superb. In terminology 
the engineers agreed with Schirra that MA—8 was a "text book flight" - the best 
so far.
<P>Walter Williams was especially jubilant over the MA-8 success; now he could 
confidently turn his operations team to the task of the day-long mission. 
Schirra's conservation of fuel and the excellent manner in which the spacecraft 
had performed, he said, made planning for MA-9, if not routine, at least 
considerably easier.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch14-4.htm#source31"><SUP>31</A></SUP>
<P>Upon leaving the <I>Kearsarge</I>, Schirra received the leis of Hawaii and a 
tumultuous aloha. Then he flew back to Houston. In a press conference at Rice 
University, he reported about his spatial voyage to an American public that now 
was more conversant with the terminology of space technology. Thereafter, the 
hamlet of Oradell, New Jersey, greeted its most famous son, and from there 
Schirra went to Washington to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from 
the President and, from the Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy's anchored 
version of the coveted astronaut's wings. Throughout the national hurrahs, 
however, the thoughts and words of participants in Project Mercury turned toward 
the advent of the day-long mission, another step toward reaching the lunar 
landing goal in the decade of the sixties.<A

<P>In mid-October 1962 the frightening Cuban missile crisis raised the spectre 
of nuclear holocaust. This dampened some of the postflight celebrations for 
Schirra. When President Kennedy appeared on nationwide television to explain his 
actions in blockading Cuba to force the Soviets to withdraw their ballistic 
missiles from Fidel Castro's island, Americans perhaps for the first time became 
acutely aware of the differences between medium-range (200-500-mile) "defensive" 
missiles and intermediate-range (1,000-1,500-mile) "offensive" rocket weapons. 
Neither the ICBM deterrent (defined as having an operational range of about 
6,000 miles) nor the success of Kennedy's confrontation of Khrushchev over 
Soviet IRBMs in Cuba could entirely relax the tension built up by this crisis. 
But it probably did more than any manned space flight had to educate the public 
on relative thrust capacities of rockets.

Like Glenn and Carpenter before him, Schirra said he definitely sensed 
deceleration at BECO. On the other hand, he did not sense the acceleration 
tailoff that they had reported when the sustainer engine died. Max-q proved to 
be considerably noisier than Schirra had been led to expect. During the launch 
phase he heard many audible clues telling him what was taking place. These he 
described onomatopoeically, speaking of the jettisoning tower as "a rocket 
zapping off," of the clamp ring's release of the spacecraft with a "pung" sound, 
and of the posigrades' separating spacecraft from booster with a noise that 
sounded like "khuee."
