<H1>Precipitation From MR-3</H1>The "unqualified" success of the Shepard 
suborbital flight brought immense joy and satisfaction to the managers, 
engineers, associates, and astronauts of the Space Task Group. They had labored 
almost two and a half years for this first triumph. Flight failures, schedule 
slippages, press criticism, and most recently the U.S.S.R.'s attainment of the 
first orbital flight, all had tempered the pride of [361] the Mercury team. But 
May 5, 1961, saw the Nation rejoice with relief and pleasure in the success and 
safety of Alan Shepard. President Kennedy's shore-to-ship radio telephone call 
to the astronaut was spontaneous, though difficult to link, and symbolic of the 
American mood that day. Although the seven-member corps of astronauts had combat 
records and test-pilot experience to their credit, one of them at last was truly 
a hero and not just a celebrity.
<P>In the aftermath of the flight of <I>Freedom 7</I>, Gilruth once again 
published a morale memorandum for his staff. This time the subject was not a 
single favorable newspaper article, as had been the case of a story by Los 
Angeles newspaperman Marvin Miles the year before, but a compilation of formal 
congratulations to Alan Shepard from individuals in various walks of life, 
including the King of Morocco and a group of scientists in Peru.<A

<P>At the postflight press conference, Admiral Hilles quipped that the space 
race had turned into a world series played with a space ball, and that the Navy, 
naturally, had "caught the crucial fly." But the much more impressive Gagarin 
flight tempered everyone's pride but the Soviets'. What most enhanced the United 
States' prestige was not the technical prowess exhibited by MR-3 but the 
contrast between the open-door policy toward news coverage of its flight and the 
impenetrable secrecy surrounding the Soviet program.
<P>One result of all this publicity was a widespread skepticism toward the space 
claims of the U.S.S.R. Many people around the world questioned whether a Red 
cosmonaut had flown at all. An Istanbul newspaper called <I>Millyet</I>, for 
example, reported that Turkish journalists, after viewing official films of both 
Shepard's and Gagarin's flights, asked of the Soviet consul general, "In the 
Shepard film we followed all phases of his flight, but in yours we followed only 
Khrushchev. Why don't you show us your space flight, too?" A Tass correspondent, 
replying for the consul general, was quoted as having explained, "We are mainly 
interested in the people's excitement and reaction. This is what we wanted you 
to see."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-6.htm#source34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> 
Premier Nikita Khrushchev was supposed to have been much chagrined because the 
"up and down" flight of Shepard gained such extensive media publicity even 
though Gagarin had long since orbited the world.
<P>Although NASA had kept a few secrets - such as ground-control command 
frequencies and persisting classifications of old military data - the agency 
made reasonable efforts to cooperate with newsmen.
<P>[362] The President awarded NASA's Distinguished Service Medal to Alan 
Shepard in a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House on May 8. Although little 
notice was given, crowds of people lined Pennsylvania Avenue, cheering the 
veteran Navy pilot and new spaceman as he rode to the Capitol for lunch and 
back. Here and abroad, millions of people later filed by an itinerant NASA 
display to inspect <I>Freedom 7</I> at close hand. Members of Congress sensed a 
formidable change in the public's attitude toward the space program. In place of 
widespread apathy or lack of understanding toward space exploration, many of 
their constituents now seemed aware of the meaning of the adventures into the 
space void. Congressmen who had been reviewing manned space flight plans and 
proposals since early April began thinking about increased allocations of 
national resources, such as scientific manpower, for future manned space 
exploration.
<P>On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy presented a special message to Congress on 
"urgent national needs." At one point he spoke of space and of Shepard: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now is the time to take longer strides - time for a great new 
  American enterprise - time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in 
  space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth.
  <P>I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary. But the facts 
  of the matter are that we have never made the national decision or marshalled 
  the national resources required for such leadership. We have never specified 
  long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our 
  time so as to insure their fulfillment.
  <P>Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket 
  engines . . . and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead 
  for some time to come in still more impressive successes, we nevertheless are 
  required to make new efforts on our own. For while we cannot guarantee that we 
  shall one day be first, we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort 
  will make us last. We take an additional risk by making it in full view of the 
  world, but as shown by the feat of Astronaut Shepard, this very risk enhances 
  our stature when we are successful. . . .
  <P>I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before 
  this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to 
  the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to 
  mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none 
  will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-6.htm#source35"><SUP>35</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>The 
Congress, believing that the American people were also ready to support an 
expanded and ambitious long-term space exploration program, quickly endorsed 
these words of leadership from President Kennedy. Project Apollo shifted from a 
circumlunar expedition plan to a lunar landing endeavor, to be achieved before 
1970, or "before this decade is out."
<P>All through March, April, and May, members of the space committees of the 
Senate and the House busily quizzed James E. Webb, Dryden, Seamans, and other 
leaders of NASA about the implications of the Russian program and about how the 
planned time for the development of Apollo could be cut in half. But the 
appropriations debate was brief. By August 7, the Senators and Representatives 
[363] had agreed on $1,671,750,000 for NASA's fiscal 1962 budget. This was the 
first time Congress had appropriated over a billion dollars for NASA's space 
program at one time. Only $113 million less than President Kennedy had 
requested, this billion and a half dollars was but an initial appropriation, for 
the legislators understood that NASA would ask for a supplement about January 
1962.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-6.htm#source36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>Thus American aspirations in space, personalized by Astronaut Shepard on May 
5 and codified by President Kennedy's endorsement of NASA's follow-on plans on 
May 25, 1961, gained clear direction, ample funds, and official sanction. The 
national mood for space had definitely changed from what it had been at the 
uncertain beginning of the Kennedy administration. A goal of developing space 
technology for space exploration was a tangible means to "get the country moving 
again."
<P>Industries born of the frantic missile race of the mid-fifties would turn 
more and more to space-related research and development. Unlike military 
technology, such products were not needed in quantity; reliable performance was 
their highest criterion. Whereas Project Mercury, toward the end of its 
manufacturing phase in June 1961, supposedly affected approximately one out of 
90 people in the United States through industrial support of some 10,000 
companies, Project Apollo as redefined by NASA and approved by the President 
would take far more of a national effort.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-6.htm#source37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> 
Kennedy had promised that expanded conquest of space would be difficult and 
costly. But so impressive and dramatic an enterprise was Apollo, so full of 
engineering and gadgetry, that the project seemed made to order for a new 
American destiny. To President Kennedy, the United States could win an open 
competition with the Soviet Union in space because of the inherent superiority 
of an open society.
<P>Besides its portents, the President's decision had an immediate impact on the 
Space Task Group, an organization that had been studying the possibilities of 
advanced manned flight as early as 1959. In September 1960, the Apollo projects 
office formally appeared on the organization chart of the Space Task Group's 
Flight Systems Division, indicating the fulltime status of planners for Apollo. 
But the day after President Kennedy's speech of May 25, Wesley L. Hjornevik, 
formerly Glennan's administrative assistant and now Gilruth's, signed a notice 
to the Space Task Group that reassured the Mercury team of a future with Apollo. 
New funds and facilities, if approved by Congress as expected, would certainly 
affect the personal lives of the Space Task Group members by the necessity to 
reorganize and perhaps to relocate.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-6.htm#source38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>NASA Headquarters had recognized for some time that a center was needed to 
survey the whole spectrum of manned space flight programs. On January 3, 1961, 
the Space Task Group had at last been designated an autonomous field element, no 
longer to be considered a part of the Goddard Space Flight Center. The Space 
Task Group's personnel strength had increased to a total of 794 people in 
mid-1961. Until Kennedy's lunar landing decision was [364] endorsed by the 
Congress, the Space Task Group had had only one responsibility, Project Mercury, 
and no authorization to proceed with more ambitious endeavors. The end of 
Project Mercury could have meant the end of the Space Task Group. 
<P>But President Kennedy's clarion message to Congress verified a new course for 
the Space Task Group's civil servants. Back in February 1961, Gilruth had asked 
his second in command, Charles J. Donlan, to begin considering the most feasible 
programs to succeed Project Mercury. Whatever the future programs were, they 
would require new, separate, functional facilities. By May a draft study was 
completed on how such undertakings should be managed. Entitled "Organizational 
Concepts and Staffing Requirements" for a "Manned Spacecraft Development 
Center," the study declared in its preamble: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the essential elements required to implement an aggressive 
  national effort for manned space exploration is a capability within government 
  to conceive, manage, and technically monitor the development of large manned 
  spacecraft and to operate the spacecraft and related ground support equipment. 
  This portion of the total job is in itself one of the largest, if not the 
  largest research and development job ever undertaken in war or peace.
  <P>The nucleus of the capability now exists in the Space Task Group, which has 
  handled, with industry and other government resources, the Mercury Program. 
  However, a program of the much larger magnitude now contemplated would require 
  a substantial expansion of staff and facilities and instituting an 
  organizational and management concept consistent with the magnitude of the 
  program. How - and how effective - the capability is organized will have a 
  direct bearing on the success or failure of the total program.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-6.htm#source39"><SUP>39</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Only 
a few days had elapsed after President Kennedy's call to Congress for approval 
of the lunar landing program when the rank and file members of the Space Task 
Group began to read speculations in their local Virginia newspapers about where 
they might have to move. Few were eager to leave the Virginia peninsula. Many 
were glad to stop worrying about a move to Beltsville, Maryland, but no one knew 
what the alternative site would be. While wives and families fretted, the men 
and women of the Space Task Group were busier than ever before, because the 
group had just entered the final manned phase of the Mercury program. In August 
1961, NASA Headquarters ordered John F. Parsons, Associate Director of the Ames 
Research Center, to head a survey team to recommend the permanent location for a 
manned spacecraft center. One of the members of the Parsons team, Martin Byrnes, 
was subsequently assigned to study relocation programs for STG's members.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch11-6.htm#source40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>Responsibilities lay heavily upon STG. It had to accelerate the Mercury 
program to achieve its primary objective, manned orbital flight. It should start 
to recruit personnel and organize activities for the newly authorized Project 
Apollo. And, most immediately, it must carry out the second suborbital Mercury 
flight as scheduled. Once the next astronaut was recovered, the operations team 
in concert with the Space Task Group management would have to decide just how 
far to carry the Mercury-Redstone suborbital program. Many of the 30 or so [365] 
who had attended Shepard's postflight debriefing felt that this phase had served 
its purpose and that now the manned orbital phase should be initiated. This 
point was discussed in June but not by any means decided. From Shepard's 
success, however, one thing seemed clear: it was certainly not necessary to 
train all the astronauts on suborbital flights before trying to duplicate or 
triplicate Gagarin's feat.
