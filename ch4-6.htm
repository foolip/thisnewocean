<H1>Birth of NASA</H1>Even before the contour couch was demonstrated, the Air 
Force research and development planners also had about accepted the bare Atlas 
as a manned satellite booster, although they retained serious misgivings 
regarding abort and reentry g loads, orbital altitude, lifting ability, and 
reliability. But by early July 1958, there actually seemed to be an inverse 
relationship between the Air Force's progress on Man-in-Space-Soonest and the 
progress of the space bill through Congress. On July 10, Brigadier General Homer 
A. Boushey of Headquarters USAF informed the Air Research and Development 
Command that the Bureau of the Budget was firmly in favor of placing the space 
exploration program, including manned space flight, in the proposed civilian 
space organization. Nothing could be done to release further go-ahead funds from 
the Advanced Research Projects Agency.<A

<P>Only a little more than three months after the Eisenhower administration's 
draft legislation went to the Capitol, both houses of Congress on July 16 passed 
the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, creating the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Despite this long-expected action, there 
still seemed to be a chance for Man-in-Space-Soonest, provided it could be 
carried out at a relatively modest cost. So Roy Johnson and his subordinates in 
ARPA continued to admonish the Air Force to scale down its funding requests. The 
Ballistic Missile Division replied that a fiscal 1959 budgetary allotment of 
only $50 million, the latest figure suggested by ARPA, would delay the first 
manned orbital launch until late 1961 or early 1962. In its sixth development 
plan for Man-in-Space-Soonest, issued on July 24, BMD proposed orbiting a man by 
June 1960 with the bare Atlas, at a cost of $106.6 million. This was an increase 
of $7.3 million over the project cost estimate contained in the fifth 
development plan on June 15. Schriever personally wrote Anderson, Commander of 
ARDC, that the Ballistic Missile Division was already studying requirements for 
a worldwide tracking network, that the heat sink versus ablation question was 
under examination, that three companies were designing the 117L and the Vanguard 
second stage as possible backup systems for the bare Atlas, and that invitations 
for a briefing for prospective capsule contractors could be mailed within 24 
hours. Schriever asked for immediate approval for Man-in-Space-Soonest at the 
$106.6 million level.<A

<P>In Washington, on July 24 and 25, Ballistic Missile Division specialists gave 
a series of briefings for ARDC, Secretary of the Air Force Douglas, the Air 
Staff, and ARPA. The ARPA briefing featured urgent appeals for full, immediate 
program approval to give the United States a real chance to be "soonest" with a 
[98] man in space. ARPA Director Johnson flatly refused to give his go-ahead at 
that time. President Eisenhower and his advisers, he explained, were convinced 
there was then no valid role for the military in manned space flight. NACA, the 
nucleus of the civilian space program to be organized under the terms of the 
recently passed Space Act, already was planning its own manned satellite 
project, perhaps to be executed in conjunction with ARPA, at a cost of about $40 
million for fiscal 1959. Consequently, said Johnson, it was futile for the Air 
Force to expect more than $50 million for the current fiscal year for 
Man-in-Space-Soonest. The implication was the Air Force would be lucky to 
receive even that.<A

<P>Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act into law on July 29, 
1958. His action brought into being an organization to "plan, direct, and 
conduct aeronautical and space activities," to "arrange for participation by the 
scientific community in planning scientific measurements and observations," and 
to "provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of 
information concerning its activities and the results thereof" - in short, to 
guide the Nation into the Space Age.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-6.htm#source76"><SUP>76</A></SUP> 
Space activities related to defense were to continue in the DOD.
<P>There were certain basic differences between the final act and the bill that 
representatives of NACA, the Bureau of the Budget, and Eisenhower's other 
advisers had drafted and sent to Congress in April. These changes were the 
product especially of the activities and influence of three men: Lyndon B. 
Johnson, Senate majority leader and chairman of the Preparedness Subcommittee of 
the Senate Committee on Armed Services and the Senate Special Committee on Space 
and Astronautics; John W. McCormack, House majority leader and chairman of the 
House Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration; and Senate 
minority leader Styles Bridges of New Hampshire, ranking Republican on the 
Senate space committee.<A

<P>The large Space Board proposed by the administration to advise the head of 
the civilian agency gave way to a five-to-nine-member National Aeronautics and 
Space Council, charged with advising the President, who was to be its chairman. 
The provision for a National Aeronautics and Space Administration, headed by an 
administrator and a deputy administrator, rather than a "Space Agency" headed by 
a single director was, according to two staff members of the House space 
committee, "a mighty promotion in Washington bureaucratic terms."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-6.htm#source78"><SUP>78</A></SUP> 
Reflecting general concern in Congress over the relationship between space 
technology and national defense, the Space Act added a Civilian-Military Liaison 
Committee, appointed by the President, to ensure full interchange of information 
and data acquired in NASA and Defense Department programs. Other significant 
amendments pertained to patent procedures, authority to hire some 260 persons 
excepted from the civil service rating system, and NASA's obligation to 
cooperate with "other nations and groups of nations."<A

<P>Eisenhower, acting mainly on the advice of Killian, his chief scientific 
adviser, passed over the respected, apolitical Dryden, Director of NACA since 
1949, and named T. Keith Glennan, president of the Case Institute of Technology 
in Cleveland, [99] former member of the Atomic Energy Commission, and a staunch 
Republican, as the first Administrator of NASA. Dryden was appointed to the post 
of Deputy Administrator. Glennan would furnish the administrative leadership for 
the new entity, while Dryden would function as NASA's scientific and technical 
overseer. On August 15 the Senate voted its confirmation of Glennan and Dryden, 
and four days later the new Administrator met with the Abbott organization 
committee to review the proposed organization of NASA.<A

<P>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, absorbing more than 8000 
employees and an appropriation of over $100 million from NACA, was beginning to 
take shape. Under the terms of the Space Act, accompanying White House 
directives, and later agreements with the Defense Department, the fledgling 
agency acquired the Vanguard project from the Naval Research Laboratory; the 
Explorer project and other space activities at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency 
(but not the von Braun rocket group); the services of the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, hitherto an Army contractor; and an Air Force study contract with 
North American for a million-pound-thrust engine, plus other Air Force rocket 
engine projects and instrumented satellite studies. In addition, NASA was to 
receive $117 million in appropriations for space ventures from the Defense 
Department.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-6.htm#source81"><SUP>81</A></SUP> 
But the Space Act was silent regarding organizational responsibility for manned 
space flight.
