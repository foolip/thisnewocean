Suborbital Flights into Space</H2>
<P>[341] At 9:34 a.m. on May 5, 1961, about
45 million Americans sat tensely before their television screens and watched a
slim black-and-white Redstone booster, capped with a Mercury spacecraft manned
by Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., lift off its pad at Cape Canaveral and go
roaring upward through blue sky toward black space.
<P>At 2.3 seconds after launch, Shepard's voice came through clearly to Mercury
Control; minutes later the millions heard the historic transmission:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P class="noindent">
  Ahh, Roger; lift-off and the clock is started . . . Yes, sir,
  reading you loud and clear. This is <I>Freedom 7</I>. The fuel is go; 1.2 g;
  cabin at 14 psi; oxygen is go . . . <I>Freedom 7</I> is still
go!</BLOCKQUOTE>America's first man in space was in flight only 15 minutes and
22 seconds and was weightless only a third of that time. <I>Freedom 7</I> rose
to an altitude of 116.5 miles, attained a maximum speed of 5180 miles per hour,
and landed 302 miles downrange from the Cape. Shepard experienced a peak stress
of 6 g during booster acceleration and less than 12 g on reentry. Recovery
operations went perfectly, the spacecraft was undamaged, and Shepard was in
excellent and exuberant condition.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>In the light of later American space accomplishments, the flight of
<I>Freedom 7</I> was impressive for its benchmark of technical excellence in the
new technology of manned space flight and its hallmark of open media reporting.
When compared, as it inevitably was, with the previous April 12 orbital flight
of Yuri Gagarin, MR-3 was anticlimatic.
<P>Ever since December 1958, when T. Keith Glennan, the NASA Administrator, had
announced Project Mercury, the American public had awaited the first manned
Mercury flight with fairly general misgivings. Many people whose expectations
had been stimulated by publicity became impatient at the long delays and
postponements. Some deplored the whole space program as wasteful and of doubtful
value. A few still believed space travel was impossible for human beings.
<P>[342] Then, on February 22, 1961, the Space Task Group announced that
Shepard, John H. Glenn, and Virgil I. Grissom had been chosen to begin special
training for the MR-3 vault into space. More than a month before the public
announcement, Robert R. Gilruth personally had made his choice, even to the
exact flight order of the men selected. In early January, back at Langley, the
day after he had bid outgoing Administrator Glennan goodbye in Washington,
Gilruth had decided to inform the flight crewmen of their selection status. He
drove over to the temporary building housing the astronaut offices, called the
seven men together, and told them of his decision that Shepard would be the
first flight astronaut.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
And while the West awaited the next development, Gagarin made his 108-minute
near-polar orbit of Earth aboard the five-ton <I>Vostok I</I> (meaning East)
spacecraft.
<P>Although some Americans professed disbelief in the Gagarin flight, a majority
surely felt a twinge of nationalistic pain in admitting the Soviets had won the
first honor in the two-nation race into space. When Shepard's flight took place,
barely a month after Gagarin, even the skeptics appeared to derive consolation
from the fact that the American launch and recovery had been made in the light
of full publicity, with all world news media participating, whereas the Vostok
flight had been veiled in official secrecy until after the fact.
<P><I>Freedom 7</I>, Shepard's capsule, missed what had been widely considered a
"realistic" launch schedule by six months. When the capsule had finally been
delivered to the Cape on December 9, 1960, some assumed the flight could be made
at once. But 21 weeks of preparation - not all of it anticipated - were required
by STG's Cape preflight checkout group and a host of McDonnell engineers based
at the Florida site. Reaction control system checkout and rework were
responsible for a launch schedule postponement to March 6, 1961. Replacement of
damaged and corroded peroxide lines forced a further delay of eight days.
Rerunning the simulated mission test and correcting structural and equipment
defects were other time-consuming problems.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>Thus, technically, it was May 2 before the launch of capsule No. 7 might have
been made. Then why not use capsule No. 8 or 9 or 11? Because capsule No. 7 had
been selected in the summer and groomed since October 1960 as McDonnell's best
product to date, the only porthole version of the capsule that had been or would
be man-rated in all respects. By January 1961, after the MR-1A flight had used
up Mercury-Redstone booster No. 3, the one originally intended for the first
man-launch vehicle, it was clear that Redstone No. 7 would boost capsule No. 7.
At the end of March, when booster No. 7 arrived at the Cape, Shepard already
knew he was Robert R. Gilruth's prime choice to fly it. "There was no hope,"
said Shepard, "that a later model of the capsule incorporating our suggestions
could be ready in time for MR-3." So capsule No. 7 on booster No. 7 should be
the first combination of a series of at least seven flights to put Americans
into space. "What better name or call-sign could I choose than <I>Freedom
7</I>?" asked Shepard.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<P>[343] Although the delays were disheartening, there were compensatory
benefits in the way of astronaut training. Some psychologists feared that this
long time lapse before the flight actually took place might cause "over
training" and staleness. But in the postflight debriefing, Shepard complimented
the so-called "over training"; he remarked that the similarity of training
conditions to actual flight conditions was a key factor in making the mission
seem almost routine. In addition, new and better procedures were developed
during repeated rehearsals of the mission, which might not have come to light
had the training not been expanded a few weeks.

<H3>Final Preparation for MR-3</H3>The Space Task Group had decided to train
Shepard, Glenn, and Grissom especially for the MR-3 mission because the
competitive field had to be narrowed for this particular mission to allow the
remaining astronauts to prepare for ground support jobs and the Mercury-Atlas
orbital missions. Shepard's activity chart for February 1961 shows that he spent
18 days at Cape Canaveral becoming oriented to spacecraft No. 7 and its
peculiarities. Long before the final phases of pilot preparations came about,
Shepard and Walter C. Williams had insisted that the designated astronaut must
become an integral part of the preflight checkout activities. So, based on this
procedure, Shepard and Glenn acquired the special feel of No. 7's attitude
control system in hangar checkouts. When the capsule was placed in the altitude
test chamber, Shepard went along for the "ride" and exercised the environmental
control system.
<P>The most valuable operational training the astronaut received before his
mission came from sessions in two McDonnell-built, Link-type trainers, one at
Langley and the other at the Cape. These devices were first called "procedures
trainers" and later "Mercury simulators." Here the space pilot, supine in a
mockup capsule, rehearsed the flight plan for a specific mission. The trainer
instruments were capable of being tied in with computers at the Mercury Control
Center. Overall operations team practice welded ground controllers and astronaut
into a unit. Although not devoted exclusively to the MR-3 mission, the
simulators were in use 55 to 60 hours a week during the three months preceding
the flight of <I>Freedom 7</I>. During the entire training period, Shepard
"flew" 120 simulated Mercury-Redstone flights.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
<P>For an eight-week period immediately preceding the flight, the rehearsals
became even more exacting. In preparing for the altitude chamber runs at space
equivalent altitudes, the astronaut was examined in preflight physicals, fitted
with medical sensors, including a rectal thermometer, and helped into his
20-pound pressure suit. The pilot and his medical attendants then went through
the mission as realistically as conditions would allow, conducting pressure and
medical checks.
<P>Another carefully rehearsed phase of the program consisted of the transfer
[345] of the pilot from his quarters on the balcony of Hangar S to the transfer
van, the ride to the pad, and simulated flights with the astronaut sitting in
the actual spacecraft. Countdowns were conducted while controllers manned their
consoles. The first two rehearsal "flights," held on April 18 and 19, kept the
service structure, or gantry, against the vehicle, and the capsule hatch was not
closed. But the next day, on a third simulated mission, the hatch was closed,
the gantry was pulled away, and the spacecraft was purged with oxygen as if an
actual mission were in progress. Training like this and in the procedures
trainer continued until two days before the scheduled flight.<A

<P>Three purposes were served by this extensive training program. The astronaut
became intimately familiar with the role and voice of each person supporting the
mission. He acquired more physical and mental familiarity with all of the
associated hardware. And he was made even more aware of the day-to-day status
leading to launch date. The operations team benefited by having the astronaut
attend the team's technical briefings. These discussions covered both the
spacecraft and the launch vehicle and included mission reviews held the week
before launch.
<P>On the eve of the launch, a briefing was conducted exclusively for the
astronaut, with specialists in each system reporting on final readiness. Walter
J. Kapryan presented the capsule and booster status; Robert B. Voas reviewed
astronaut flight tasks; Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., briefed the astronaut on
flight control and network status; Robert F. Thompson told him of recovery
procedures; and Ernest A. Amman gave him the forecast on weather conditions.
Next morning, L. Gordon Cooper, blockhouse communicator, obtained reports from
key operations personnel and gave the astronaut his final ready-room briefing
before he ascended the gantry. Plans for the postflight debriefing sessions,
wherein the student astronaut would become the teacher of his preflight
instructors, were also laid out in detail by the end of April.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
<P>The planning of recovery operations was as important as any other phase of
the mission. Rear Admiral F. V. H. Hilles, in command of the experienced
flotilla of eight destroyers known as DesFlotFour, worked with another flag
officer, G. P. Koch, aboard the carrier <I>Lake Champlain</I>, on the tactics
for this mission. STG's primary strategy was to recover both man and capsule by
using land-based Marine helicopters for launch-site abort situations within
about 80 miles of the Cape and carrier-based helicopters in the primary recovery
area, within a hundred-mile radius. Makeup of the recovery force was similar to
that for MR-2, with tiered groups of men and equipment, beginning at Cape
Canaveral, ready to cover all contingencies - abort, normal flight, or
overflight. The main recovery force of ships was deployed in an elongated
pattern 500 miles down along the range. It consisted of the carrier, eight
destroyers, and one Atlantic Missile Range radar tracking ship. The helicopters
again were manned by Marine Air Group 26, a veteran recovery unit.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>Some innovations were added to the recovery plans as a result of experience
[346] gained in the MR-2 chimpanzee flight. For one thing, there was still the
possibility that <I>Freedom 7</I> might overshoot its landing target, in which
case the time factor could be vital. Obviously a highly mobile unit was
desirable. Walter Williams, operations director, requested an amphibian SA-16
aircraft with a pararescue team as an emergency rescue measure. Two such teams
were provided, adding the support of the Air Rescue Service and Navy frogmen to
Project Mercury.
<P>A second change involved communications. When the spacecraft was near impact
it passed below the radio horizon; Williams reminded the Air Force Missile Test
Center commander that continuous voice communications with the astronaut in the
final moments of flight and after impact required a communications relay plane.
The Air Force assigned a communications aircraft, code-named Cardfile 23, to the
mission.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>The helicopter recovery technique was perfected late during the astronaut
preparation period. According to the original helicopter recovery procedures,
the chopper would lift the spacecraft with the pilot inside and ferry both to
the ship. John Glenn protested that the danger in this procedure to both
astronaut and helicopter pilots was too great in case trouble developed during
the operation. He strongly recommended further review. After much study and
practice of procedures, STG decided at a conference on April 15, 1961, to use
helicopters as the primary mode of recovery. The helicopter would arrive, hover
over the spacecraft, and talk with the pilot by UHF. The helicopter copilot
would snip off the capsule's high-frequency antenna, snare the capsule recovery
loop, and raise the vehicle slightly out of the water. By this time the
astronaut would be completely out of harness and the hatch would be clear of the
water. Then the astronaut would open the side hatch, crawl through, and catch a
second sling lowered from the helicopter. The helicopter would hoist both
astronaut and spacecraft and carry them to the main recovery ship.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
<P>Since a man was to be aboard this flight, another vital part of the planning
activities involved weather reporting and surveillance. Beginning in June 1960,
Francis W. Reichelderfer, chief of the United States Weather Bureau, had
promised to Administrator Glennan and provided for the Space Task Group full
meteorological support for Project Mercury. By mid-April 1961, a special weather
support group, consisting of three units under Kenneth M. Nagler, was utilizing
every resource of the Bureau (including the satellite <I>Tiros II</I>) to
forecast the weather accurately for STG.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>Before MR-3, the seven-man Miami forecast unit, headed by Jesse R. Gulick,
analyzed reconnaissance data on weather conditions for 200 miles beyond the
planned launch and recovery areas. Weather Bureau aircraft from Miami overflew
the area at altitudes of 5000 to 20,000 feet, then, three hours before launch,
dipped down below 1500 feet. The flight plan followed a box pattern, with the
amount of surveillance dictated by weather conditions at a particular point. The
recovery ships were integrated into a weather-reporting mission, [347] making
reports at assigned times and providing special surface observations, such as
sea state and wind velocity, at the critical time near launch. Weather observers
at the launch site also kept a careful watch on air and seawater temperatures,
relative humidity, cloud cover, and winds.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
<P>As the flight date neared, STG personnel briefed the ship crews of the
recovery force. Martin A. Byrnes, Robert Thompson, and Charles I. Tynan, Jr., of
STG found the naval crews not wholly trained in the specifics of this particular
mission. So they immediately initiated a brief education program, giving talks,
providing reading material, and showing motion pictures of the MR-2 chimpanzee
flight. Tynan also carefully briefed each man charged with capsule-handling
duties on his particular role. To cradle the recovered capsule the Navy had
constructed 20-by-25-foot dollies and topped them with old mattresses. Then
aeromedical teams arrived, prepared sick bay areas, and briefed the ships'
medical personnel. After one medical group found that two members of one of the
destroyers had recently contracted hepatitis, the crew members of that ship were
barred from donating blood, even in an emergency. Byrnes, who felt that the
recovery-force briefings should become standard procedure for succeeding
flights, said that the Navy was pleased with the pep talks.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>

<H3>Last-Minute Qualms</H3>While the entire NASA program was under review by the
new Administration in Washington early in 1961, Project Mercury was nearing its
manned space flight phase. During the first four months of the year the major
discussion would center around a proposed acceleration of the entire United
States' space program to include a lunar-landing mission. Conversely, the
Mercury program in the same time frame came under direct scrutiny of the
President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which was charged with reviewing
the scientific contents of all major Federal projects. Some members of PSAC were
not fully satisfied that Project Mercury was all it should be, particularly with
regard to the reliability of the Redstone and Atlas boosters and to the novel
life-science hazards.
<P>The Mercury-Atlas and Mercury-Redstone failures of the year before, as was
made evident in the January 1961 report of the President-elect's Space Task
Force under the leadership of Jerome B. Wiesner, had not helped build the
confidence of physical and life scientists that Mercury was truly a man-rated
program. An ad hoc Mercury panel was created by PSAC to delve into the
scientific details and reliability of the overall Mercury system and advise the
President if it appeared likely that the United States would be beset with
another well-publicized but inexplicable failure. Basically, the PSAC panel
sought to investigate the level of risk involved in Mercury before a man was to
be committed to an actual space flight. This inquiry was penetrating. Panel
members spent five days in March visiting McDonnell, Space Task Group, and Cape
Canaveral, receiving a series of detailed briefings and interviews. Several
medical uncertainties appeared [348] outstanding and worrisome, although the
panel had found the NASA presentations to be frank, competent, and impressive.
<P>The scientific objective of Mercury in determining the effects of
weightlessness upon man, some felt, might have been pursued in a more clinical
manner. Before the first manned flight there might have been a greater number of
animal flights progressing toward absolute physiological and psychological
limits. Past Mercury flight tests appeared more systematic for hardware
engineering than for medical problems. As a case in point, it was noted by the
panel members that the MR-2 mission had demonstrated excessive vibration and
overacceleration in the launch phase, so that an additional booster test flight
(MR-BD) had been inserted to precede the first manned suborbital flight. Pilots
in the X-15 rocket research airplane, as well as Ham, the "space chimp" aboard
MR-2, had recorded surprisingly high pulse rates concurrently with low blood
pressures, yet there were no plans to include a blood-pressure measuring device
in the upcoming manned flight (efforts to develop such a device were as yet
unsuccessful). In addition, the panel members learned that Ham had taken his
turn on the centrifuge, but that the acceleration profiles had no precise
correlation with stresses and forces of those predicted for the MR-2 mission.
<P>Despite these gnawing medical doubts, in general the PSAC panel members felt
that the Mercury hardware and its reliability had been developed with great
care. They were especially impressed with the redundant systems of the
spacecraft, as well as the procedures and devices that had been integrated to
assure pilot safety during launch. In fact, several panel members stated at STG
that it seemed everything necessary to assure pilot survival had been
considered.
<P>In their final analysis, the PSAC panel assessed all risks and agreed that
Mercury was ready to fly a man. The scientific purpose indeed was to determine
man's suitability for the stresses and weightlessness associated with space
flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
<P>The orbital flight of Yuri Gagarin on April 12 seems to have removed any
lingering medical qualms about manned flight. Mercury Director Gilruth had full
confidence in the Space Task Group physicians and their endorsement by the space
medicine community long before <I>Vostok I</I>. W. Randolph Lovelace II,
Brigadier General Don D. Flickinger, and others familiar with the medical
stresses of flight likewise had been convinced that pilot safety was fully
assured. Yet if the medical profession as a whole had voiced scientific
opposition to manned flight in Mercury, or if <I>Vostok I</I> had not flown when
it did, it would have been impossible to proceed with a man in MR-3
immediately.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
<P>Centrifuge tests of the astronaut's couch continued to raise NASA confidence
in the adequacy of Mercury systems to maintain an astronaut's safety under
acceleration into and deceleration from the space environment. But the abrupt
negative acceleration of the final impact on Earth remained a nagging worry,
particularly in case of a land landing. The aluminum honeycomb shock-attenuation
material under the couch had been bought as insurance, but was it enough?
Continued experiments early in 1961 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio,
[349] were conducted to determine how rapidly one could stop, facing aft in the
semi-supine position, without exceeding human tolerance. These tests showed that
forces up to 35 times a person's weight could be endured for a fraction of a
second. But the volunteers so tested were momentarily stunned. In theory, this
meant that a spacecraft could land without an impact bag, but the idea of having
a "slightly stunned" astronaut in what should be made a routine operation was
unacceptable. So STG had reassigned the development of a suitable impact bag
system to Jack A. Kinzler's technical services team and to Rodney G. Rose and
Peter J. Armitage. These men worked around the clock in March and April trying
to perfect a seaworthy shock-absorber. All other pilot-safety systems were ready
for a safe and successful flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
<P>Barely a month had passed after the three chosen astronauts began training
for MR-3 when the press began speculating as to which one would make the flight.
On March 25, John Glenn became the favorite contender, although one report added
that there was plenty of betting on Grissom, since the Air Force had been
designated by the Defense Department to manage and conduct military space
missions. This intimation of service competition spread quickly. Some newspapers
even implied that the Army and Navy strongly suspected the Air Force had leaked
Glenn's name to embarrass NASA and reduce his chances.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
<P>The astronauts themselves watched all these conjectures with amusement,
keeping tight the secret knowledge of their order of succession. According to
Voas, their psychologist and training officer, there was only one thing that
terrified all seven: the fear that something might prevent one of them from
flying his own mission when the time came.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>Speculation on the designated pilot abated shortly after Robert C. Seamans,
Jr., third in command at NASA Headquarters, appeared before the House Science
and Astronautics Committee and testified that each astronaut would have his
flight training opportunity aboard a Mercury-Redstone at six-week intervals.
Gilruth had, of course, long since decided on an order of preference among the
three astronauts designated, and had informed them of it, but everyone kept the
secret well because of the everpresent likelihood of unforeseen changes.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
<P>Toward the end of April there was so much publicity that some Senators, among
them Republican John J. Williams of Delaware and Democrat J. W. Fulbright of
Arkansas, thought the flight should be postponed and then conducted in secret
lest it become a well-publicized failure. This was not the general view in
Congress, however. Most members, while aware of the danger of too much
publicity, felt tradition required the press to have free access to events of
such magnitude as the first American manned space flight. Besides, the Russians
had received international criticism for conducting an ultra-secret space
program.
<P>While many highly placed officials, several close to President Kennedy, were
apprehensive about the possibility of an overly publicized fiasco, others
pressed to get the manned space flight program moving. On March 22, at a White
House meeting, Hugh L. Dryden had explained to the President that no [350]
unwarranted risks would be involved in the first manned Mercury flight, and that
the decision to "go" was that of the project management best qualified to assess
the operational hazards. When the notion was raised in late April that MR-3
should be postponed until all possible hazards had been removed, Edward C.
Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council,
observed to the President, "Why postpone a success?"
<P>President Kennedy wanted to be assured of a much better than average chance
for success and asked for these assurances almost until launch. On the day
preceding the flight, the President's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, called
NASA Headquarters Public Information Officer Paul P. Haney at the MR-3 News
Center in Cocoa Beach, Florida. She said the President wanted to review
television coverage plans. Live coverage was to begin two minutes before launch.
After some delay, Mrs. Lincoln said the President had asked Press Secretary
Pierre Salinger to handle the call. Salinger said the President was concerned
over the reliability of the escape system in the event of a Redstone
malfunction. Haney reviewed the history of the launch escape system for the
President's office and Salinger said the information should satisfy the
President's inquiry.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
<P>Cancellation of the flight on Tuesday, May 2, because of inclement weather,
forced a recycle of the systems countdown for a 48-hour period. On Thursday
unfavorable weather again prevented the launch. Countdown did begin, however,
for a Friday launch.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
<P>As it happened, the press and public learned the MR-3 astronaut's identity
only after the countdown had been canceled, 2 hours and 20 minutes before
launch, on May 2. Shepard had been waiting in Hangar S in his pressure suit
ready to go for more than 3 hours. Gilruth reaffirmed his prime pilot decision a
day before the scheduled launch, basing Shepard's selection on advice from his
medical, training, and technical assistants.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
But he had withheld his announcement because of the chance for a last-minute
change.
<P>The American public participated vicariously in the experiment. For the first
time, the maiden flight of a revolutionary manned vehicle, climaxing years of
research and development, was open wide to public view. Only a handful of
spectators saw the Wright Brothers accomplish man's first powered flight in
1903. In many parts of the country and the world, people accepted that event
only years afterward. But for the American taxpayers' first manned space flight,
NASA arranged procedures well in advance to enable all domestic news media and
foreign news services to view and report the events surrounding MR-3. By April
24, some 350 correspondents were registered. As a result of their activities,
the dateline "Cape Canaveral" soon became familiar to all the world. Radio and
television coverage was equally energetic; telecasts originating at the Cape,
particularly on May 5, were enthralling.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
<P>Starting at 8:30 p.m. on May 4, the countdown proceeded without a hitch.
Around midnight a built-in hold was called for the purpose of installing the
pyrotechnics, servicing the hydrogen peroxide system, and allowing the
operations [351] team some rest. The countdown was resumed in the early morning
hours of May 5, and another intended hold occurred some two and a half hours
before the 7 a.m. anticipated launch to assure that spacecraft checkout was
complete before transporting the astronaut to the pad area.
<P>Shepard, awakened at 1:10 a.m., began an unhurried but precise routine
involving a shower and a shave. With his physician, William K. Douglas, his
understudy, John Glenn, and a few other members of the operational team, he sat
down to a breakfast consisting of orange juice, a filet mignon wrapped in bacon,
and some scrambled eggs. Shepard had begun a low-residue diet three days before
the anticipated launch. At 2:40 a.m. he received a physical examination. This
was followed by the placement of biosensors at points indicated by tattoo marks
on his body. He was now ready for Joe W. Schmitt, an STG suit technician, to
assist him in donning the pressure suit.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
<P>Shepard entered the transfer van at 3:55 a.m. In the van, on the way to the
pad, he lay on a couch while technicians purged his suit with oxygen. When the
van arrived at the pad, Schmitt began to attach the astronaut's gloves while
Gordon Cooper briefed him on the launch status.
<P>At 5:15 a.m. Shepard, carrying his portable air conditioner, ascended the
gantry, and five minutes later he entered the spacecraft. If everything went
well, he had two hours and five minutes to wait before liftoff. While Shepard
was preparing to lower himself into the couch, his right foot slipped off the
right elbow support. But he eased himself into position without further
difficulty.
<P>Schmitt fastened the harness and helped with the hose connections. Then he
solemnly shook the spaceman's gloved hand. "Happy landings, Commander!" chorused
the gantry crew.
<P>For Alan Shepard, this was the most dramatic moment of his 37 years, a moment
he would recall with the most acute poignancy for the rest of his life.
Afterward he told how his heart quickened as the hatch was closed.
<P>The sensation was brief; his heartbeat soon returned to normal. At 6:25 a.m.
he began a denitrogenation procedure by breathing pure oxygen. This was to
prevent aeroembolism, or decompression sickness, the airman's equivalent of the
deep-sea diver's bends.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
<P>Now the countdown resumed.
<P>At 15 minutes before launch the sky became slightly overcast, so photographic
conditions were below par. Weathermen said the conditions would clear in 35 to
40 minutes, and a hold was called. Shepard became resigned to this hold and
relaxed by peering through the periscope. He was not uncomfortable, because he
was able to shift his body in the couch. Telemetered biomedical data confirmed
that his condition was good. While waiting for the clouds to clear away, a hold
was called to replace a 115-volt, 400-cycle inverter in the electrical system of
the launch vehicle. This hold lasted for 52 minutes, after which the count was
recycled to 35 minutes before launch. [352] At the 15-minute point, one of the
Goddard IBM 7090 computers in Maryland was found to be in error. Making this
correction required a complete computer recheck-run. After a total hold time of
two hours and 34 minutes, the count continued and progressed without more
trouble. Shepard had been in the capsule four hours and 14 minutes when the
final seconds ticked off to liftoff.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
<P>Two minutes before the launch, voice communications between the astronaut and
the operations team switched from Cooper in the blockhouse to Donald K. Slayton
in the Mercury Control Center. From that point until launch, the "talk" was
continuous as each panel monitor advised Slayton of his system's status for
relay to Shepard. To the astronaut the monitors seemed slow in reporting the go
condition, and this he attributed to his own eagerness to be off. Schirra was
now circling above in his F-106 chase plane, waiting to follow the Redstone and
Shepard as high as he could. Because of his excitement, Shepard said he failed
to hear much of the closing countdown, with the exception of the firing command.
During this period his pulse rate rose from 80 per minute to 126 at the liftoff
signal. This rise caused no medical concern, for it was about the same as that
of an automobile driver moving out from a service road to a freeway crowded with
heavy traffic. Shepard was not alone in his excitement; he was joined by the
operations team, the press corps at the Cape, and millions of people viewing the
liftoff on television.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>

<H3>Shepard's Ride</H3>Shepard saw the umbilical cable supplying prelaunch
electrical power to the Mercury-Redstone and its supporting boom fall away. He
raised his hand to start the elapsed-time clock that ticked off the seconds of
the flight. The onboard camera, clicking at six frames per second, confirmed his
alertness as the MR-3 combination roared and began to climb. He was surprised by
the smoothness of the liftoff and the clearness of Slayton's voice in Mercury
Control. All his transmissions were acknowledged without requests for repeat.
The ride continued smoothly for about 45 seconds; then the rocket, capsule, and
astronaut began vibrating. Conditioned to these circumstances, Shepard realized
that he was passing through the transonic speed zone, where turbulence built up.
The buffeting became rugged at the point of maximum aerodynamic pressures, about
88 seconds after liftoff; Shepard's head and helmet were bouncing so hard that
he could not read his panel dials. Sound levels were noticeably higher at that
point but still not uncomfortable. Shortly thereafter both the noise and the
vibration abated. Now enjoying a much smoother ride, Shepard told Slayton that
the dial-scanning procedure he was supposed to follow was impractical. He had to
omit reading the electrical power dials to pay more attention to his oxygen and
hydrogen peroxide supply indicators.
<P>The cabin pressure inside <I>Freedom 7</I> sealed off at 5.5 pounds per
square inch, [353] as programmed. Pressed by 6 g at two minutes after launch,
Shepard still was able to report "all systems go." The Redstone's engine shut
down on schedule at 142 seconds, having accelerated the astronaut to a velocity
of 5134 miles per hour, close to the nominal speed. The trajectory, similar to
that of the MR-BD flight, was only one degree off course, which meant a
variation of slightly more than a mile in peak altitude. After engine cutoff,
Shepard heard the tower-jettison rocket fire and turned his head to peer out the
port, hoping that he might see the smoke from the pyrotechnics. There was no
smoke, but the green tower-jettison light on his panel assured him that the
pylon was gone. Shepard strained in his couch under an acceleration that hit a
peak g load of 6.3. Outside the capsule the shingle temperature reached 220
degrees F, but inside the cabin the temperature was only 91 degrees. The
astronaut was hardly perspiring in his pressure suit at 75 degrees.
<P>After tower separation, which occurred two minutes and 32 seconds after
launch, Shepard disarmed the retrorocket-jettison switch and advised Slayton
that his capsule was free from the booster. At three minutes the automatic
attitude control system about-faced the capsule to a heatshield-forward position
for the remainder of the flight. Momentary oscillations climaxed the turnaround
maneuver, whereupon the automatic thrusters cut in for five seconds to steady,
or "damp," the capsule into its proper attitude. Now almost at the top of his
suborbital trajectory, Shepard went to work on his most important task,
determining whether an astronaut could control his spacecraft's attitude.
<P>He began to switch the control system to manual, one axis at a time. First he
took over pitch, which he was able to adjust by moving the handcontroller in his
right grip forward or backward to give the spacecraft the proper up or down
attitude. His first action was to position the spacecraft in the retrofire
attitude, tilted 34 degrees above a local horizontal mark. The pitch indicator
on <I>Freedom 7</I> was scribed at 45 degrees, as earlier studies had proposed,
but more recent investigations had indicated that 34 degrees was a better angle.
<P>While Shepard was in control of pitch, the automatic system was controlling
yaw, or left and right motion, and roll, or revolving motions. When Shepard
assumed control of all three axes, he was pleased to find that the feel was
about the same as in the procedures trainer, the Mercury simulator. Although he
could control his ship well, he was unable to hear the spurting control jets
above the noise of his radio. He encountered one small problem while using his
handcontroller: when he moved his hand to yaw, the wrist seal bearing of his
suit bumped into his personal parachute. To make the proper displacement, he had
to push hard.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
<P>When he tried to carry out another of his flight objectives, observing the
scene below him, Shepard immediately noticed that the periscope had the medium
gray filter in place. While waiting on the pad, he had used this filter to
eliminate the glare of the intermittently bright sunlight and had planned to
remove the filter when he retracted the periscope, just before launch. But being
otherwise [355] occupied at the time, he had forgotten to make the change.
During spacecraft turnaround he tried to remove the filter, but as he reached
for the filter knob the pressure gauge on his left wrist banged into the abort
handle. He carefully pulled his hand away. After that he forgot about the
intensity filter and observed the wondrous sights below through the gray slide.
He first tried to estimate the span of his terrestrial vision. The periscope,
located two feet in front of him, had two settings, low and high magnification.
On low at the 100-mile altitude, there theoretically should have been a field
view of about 1900 miles in diameter, and on high, a segment 80 miles in
diameter. Shepard was able to distinguish clearly the continental land masses
from the cloud masses. He first reported seeing the outlines of the west coast
of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. He saw Lake Okeechobee, in the central part
of Florida, but could not see any city. Andros Island and the Bahamas also
appeared in the scope. Later Shepard would remark that Earth displays flashed
before him in his air-lubricated free-axis trainer had been most valuable in
helping him to distinguish land masses passing beneath the spacecraft.

</DIV>

<P>As Shepard sped over the peak of his trajectory, now under fully automatic
attitude control, he began to notice a slow pitch rate. At this point his flight
plan dictated that he switch to the fly-by-wire mode of operation, wherein the
astronaut operated the handcontroller to change the position of the capsule,
using the hydrogen peroxide jets of the automatic system to effect the changes
rather than those of the manual system. Thus Shepard would manually position
<I>Freedom 7</I> for the retrofire that was scheduled to occur shortly after
attaining the zenith of his trajectory at 116.5 miles. The astronaut switched to
fly-by-wire, but as he started to make a yaw and roll maneuver he noticed that
the spacecraft pitch position was low, being 20 to 25 degrees rather than the
desired 34 degrees for retrofire attitude. Although he could not remember
exactly whether he made a yaw or roll maneuver, he did immediately begin to work
on his pitch problem. Then the retrorockets fired, creating a noise that was
easily heard but was not as loud as the sound of the ALFA trainer jets. This
provided what later astronauts on orbital missions described as "a comforting
kick in the pants." Pieces of debris, including a restraining strap, flashed by
the capsule portholes as the retropack was jettisoned. Glancing back to the
control panel, Shepard saw no confirming sequence light, but Slayton radioed his
telemetered knowledge of retropack jettison. So the astronaut pushed the manual
override; finally the reluctant light appeared. This was the only failure of an
event-sequence light during the MR-3 mission.
<P>While riding down the reentry curve toward a water landing, Shepard again
assumed the fly-by-wire mode of control. He later reported that the feel of
fly-by-wire was very similar to that of the trainers. Although he had a tendency
to overcontrol in the fly-by-wire mode, he had the pleasant feeling of being in
full command, for a few minutes at least, of his spacecraft's attitude. Then
Shepard allowed the automatic system to regain control and stabilize the
spacecraft for reentry. [356] The periscope automatically retracted when
<I>Freedom 7</I> began its plummet into Earth's atmosphere.
<P>On the way down, Shepard tried to look out the awkwardly placed ports to
observe the stars. He saw nothing, not even the horizon. These futile attempts
at star-finding got him behind in his work. As he commented later, this was the
only time during the flight when he did not feel "on top" of the situation and
ready for anything. The feeling of indecision passed quickly. He immediately
reported when the .05-g light came on, the indication that the g-load buildup
was about to commence. He was surprised that the light flashed and zero g ended
about a minute ahead of the time he had come to expect from his simulated
experience in the procedures trainer. As the reentry loads began to build up to
a peak of 11.6 g, the oscillations also increased moderately. As soon as the
highest g point had passed and the spacecraft had steadied, Shepard left
fly-by-wire and cut in the automatic control system.
<P>Shepard was supposed to give an altimeter reading between 80,000 and 90,000
feet, but since his rate of descent was faster than he expected, he became
worried over the deployment of the drogue parachute and forgot to report his
altitude. As the altimeter dial slipped past 40,000 feet, the astronaut braced
and listened closely for the drogue mortar to fire. He gave the Cape a reading
of 30,000 feet, and 9000 feet later the drogue snapped out without a kick. Once
his fall was broken the periscope extended, giving a view of the trailing and
reassuring drogue. The opening of the air-inlet snorkel valve to accept ambient
air pressure at 15,000 feet struck Shepard as coming a trifle late. The antenna
canister atop the spacecraft blew off as planned at 10,000 feet, pulling the
main parachute with it. Shepard clearly saw and felt it in its initial reefed
and partially unfurled condition, which prevented the lines from snapping.
Within seconds it spread to its 63-foot diameter, giving the astronaut a
reassuring jolt, but one considerably less violent than he had received in
centrifuge simulated training. "I was delighted to see it," Shepard remarked
with considerable understatement. And well he might be, for at that stage of the
flight most of the critical moments had passed. <I>Freedom 7</I> had closely
followed its assigned trajectory and the recovery forces were standing by for
its pickup.
<P>Falling toward the water at a rate of 35 feet per second, in contrast to the
maximum rate of 6550 feet per second during the powered phase of the flight,
Shepard pushed the switch to dump the remaining hydrogen peroxide fuel. Glancing
at the dials, he noted another green light, indicating that the landing bag with
its four-foot impact skirt had dropped down to cushion the water landing. He
reported to the Cape that everything was in order before <I>Freedom 7</I>
dropped below the radio horizon.
<P>The astronaut used the brief remaining time before impact to remove his knee
straps, open the faceplate shield, and remove the hose connections of his
pressure suit. Then came the thud of water impact, comparable to landing an
aircraft on a carrier. <I>Freedom 7</I> splashed and listed over into the water
on the [357] astronaut's right side, about 60 degrees from an upright position.
The chutes cast loose automatically on impact to prevent dragging. As the water
sloshed over the ports, the spaceman saw the fluorescein dye spreading over an
ever-increasing area. Shepard quickly checked the spacecraft interior to see if
any leaks had resulted from impact. There were none; it was dry. Now slowly
<I>Freedom 7</I> came to an upright position, taking about a minute's time, and
Shepard jubilantly reported to Cardfile 23, the communications airplane, that he
was all right.
<P>Helicopters of Marine Air Force Group 26 were waiting. Wayne E. Koons and
George F. Cox, pilot and copilot, respectively, of the primary helicopter, had
watched the spacecraft for about five minutes on its descent. After splashdown,
Koons quickly maneuvered his chopper into position for the retrieval exercise.
Glancing at <I>Freedom 7</I>, Cox noted that the high-frequency antenna was not
in its correct position as he hooked the cable through the recovery loop. Koons
maneuvered the helicopter to lift the spacecraft partially out of the water,
awaiting pilot egress. All of a sudden the high-frequency antenna pronged
upward, hit and dented the bottom of the helicopter, and broke off. But no
damage was done; Shepard told Koons he would debark as soon as <I>Freedom
7</I>'s hatch cleared the water.
<P>While Shepard worked himself into a sitting posture, Koons asked again if he
was ready. Not yet, he replied; he was still removing his restraint harness and
he could still see water against the ports. So the chopper raised the spacecraft
further and Shepard unlocked the hatch.
<P>The astronaut then wormed his way over the hatch sill and grappled for his
"horse collar" hoisting sling. He soon grasped the line and fitted the sling
under his arms. On the way up he brushed against the remainder of the
high-frequency antenna, but it was flexible and did no harm. The hovering
chopper had no difficulty getting Shepard aboard and in lifting <I>Freedom 7</I>
from the water and transporting it to the carrier <I>Lake Champlain</I>. When
Shepard finally stepped on the carrier's deck, only 11 minutes had elapsed since
the water landing. About half an hour after he had begun his free-dictation
report, Shepard was called to the flag bridge to answer an unexpected telephone
call from President Kennedy, who had watched the launching and followed flight
details closely via television and who now congratulated the astronaut on his
flight into space.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
<P>Aboard the <I>Lake Champlain</I>, the immediate task was determining what
shape Shepard was in after that brief but awesome excursion through space, with
its accompanying high acceleration load, weightlessness, and deceleration loads.
Some physiologists had feared that even a few minutes of weightlessness could
cause disorientation, while some psychologists were equally apprehensive about
what would happen to a space passenger's mind. But Shepard reported that he
found his five minutes of weightlessness quite pleasant. In fact, he said, he
was already in the weightless state before he realized it. For evidence, he
cited a washer that had floated beside his left ear. The weightless Shepard had
grabbed for the [358] weightless washer - and missed. Anticipating his
debriefing, the astronaut had used an analogy from his professional experience
to describe his sensations. The best comparison in his memory was riding in the
back seat of an F-100F airplane. "It was painless," he said, "just a pleasant
ride." As for any other effects of weightlessness and g stresses, Shepard had
demonstrated by assuming direct pilot control that man was quite capable of
functioning in space. He experienced no impairment of his faculties. He had
reported to Mercury Control with perfect clarity regarding his and the
spacecraft's status, and when two physicians, M. Jerome Strong and Robert
Laning, made a preliminary postflight physical examination of Shepard aboard the
carrier, they found him to be in excellent condition. From beginning to end the
flight mission had been almost perfect. The jubilant but technically
perfectionist engineers called it only an "unqualified success."<A
href="notes.htm#n11.30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
<P>Now there remained no possible doubt that man could function intelligently
aboard the Mercury spacecraft and with relative safety in a true space
environment for 15 minutes. What of the primitive spacecraft that he had
inhabited? How well did it perform? The answer seemed to be, very well indeed.
But could its systems be trusted to work under even more demanding conditions in
orbital flights? Had all the flight preparations been adequate? These were only
a few of the questions that the returning astronaut would have to answer, if
only partially and indirectly, at the seemingly interminable debriefings.

<H3>Briefing the Briefers</H3>The initial postflight period of debriefing, held
aboard the recovery ship, included a medical examination and free dictation by
the astronaut of his flight impressions. This was followed by a short debriefing
questionnaire. From the ship, the astronaut was taken to Grand Bahama Island for
an exhaustive two-day debriefing by medical and technical personnel. This
session used a prepared list of questions. Interrogations were led by Carmault
B. Jackson on medical matters, by Robert Voas on pilot activities and
performance, and by Harold I. Johnson and Sigurd A. Sjoberg on systems
performance. Some 32 specialists joined in the Grand Bahama debriefing,
including program managers, operations physicians, engineers, photographers, and
public relations personnel.

</DIV>

<P>[359] His pressure suit, Shepard said, was generally comfortable and allowed
sufficient mobility, but the left wrist pressure gauge was difficult to see
during acceleration. It should be moved, perhaps to the knee. And there was a
circulation problem caused by the rubber cots at the ends of his gloved fingers,
which meant he had to keep drawing his fingers back inside the gloves to
maintain comfort. The helmet was satisfactory. Shepard had obtained an enlarged
faceplate for his own helmet to gain better vision. He had no complaints against
the couch or restraint harness. He remembered only minor pressure points from
the couch while waiting on the pad. The straps around his shoulders had seemed
tight at times before launch, but slight shrugs had relieved the tension and
stimulated circulation.
<P>The biosensors caused some skin irritation for Shepard, as they had for
others in the Mercury program, both astronauts and test subjects. Better
adhesives were promised. Throughout the mission the suit temperature and
humidity had been quite comfortable, Shepard reported. During the hours while he
was waiting on the pad he was able to maintain a suit reading of 75 degrees,
although this rose to 77 degrees a minute or two before liftoff. His suit
temperature dropped back to 74.5 degrees for most of the flight, with a brief
rise to 82 degrees during reentry. Just before the loss of contact as the
spacecraft dropped below the radio horizon, his suit temperature dropped to 77
degrees. Then, in the capsule awaiting pickup, Shepard experienced the hottest
part of the mission. When Byrnes suggested that ventilation procedures should be
improved, Shepard remarked that he could have obtained some relief by simply
unzipping his suit.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
<P>Other parts of the environmental control system also worked satisfactorily.
The cabin temperature inside <I>Freedom 7</I> stayed within a tolerable range
from 92 to 100 degrees. Only part of one of the two four-pound bottles of oxygen
aboard had been needed. The drain on the coolant supply had been slight.
<P>The engineers among the debriefing team quizzed Shepard about the whole of
the spacecraft attitude control systems, but especially about the workings of
manual control. According to the flight plan, Shepard was to exercise three
modes of control - automatic, manual, and the fly-by-wire combination of the
two. He reported that the manual mode was quite responsive and felt the same as
the manual mode in the procedures trainers. There seemed to be a tendency for
the spacecraft to roll slightly clockwise while in the manual control.
Postflight inspectors found a small piece of debris lodged in the hydrogen
peroxide tubing, which probably caused the jets to leak a tiny increment of
thrust. Near the six-minute point in the flight, according to plan, Shepard was
supposed to switch to the fly-by-wire mode of control. Apparently he forgot to
turn off the manual valve, so the capsule's attitude control system sucked fuel
from both manual and automatic tanks. The debriefing interrogators asked him
whether he got more control than desired; he replied that rate changes seemed
high but that he thought this was caused by microswitch positions rather than
the addition of manual-proportional fuel. Shepard could not recall for certain
whether he had turned [360] off the manual valve; telemetry data monitoring the
spacecraft movements and countermovements indicated that he had not.
<P>The accessory rockets and pyrotechnics on the capsule performed adequately
during the <I>Freedom 7</I> mission, each sequence firing on time and as
designed. One exception was a secondary escape-tower jettison rocket, which was
later disassembled and found to have ignited by manual pull-ring actuation.
Since Shepard did not remember whether or not he pulled that ring, how the
rocket fired remained a mystery. It was known that this backup component had not
been used to separate the escape tower from the spacecraft. Otherwise the
capsule rocketry had performed flawlessly. The posigrades effected spacecraft
separation, the three retrograde rockets ripple-fired to provide a
510-feet-per-second velocity decrement, and the drogue parachute mortar
discharged correctly. The green sequence lights appeared on Shepard's panel with
heartwarming regularity except for the retropack jettison indicator.
<P>At impact the landing bag had performed as designed to cushion the shock, but
one heat sink stud did pierce the fiber-glass protective shield. While the
pressure vessel was undamaged, recovery had been too rapid for the seaworthiness
of the impact bag to be tested. Several rips observed in the impact skirt aboard
the carrier apparently occurred during postflight handling rather than at impact
or by bobbing in the water.
<P>In general the radio communications during flight had been extremely clear.
Slayton, the Mercury Control Center capsule communicator ("Cap Com"), said
Shepard's voice transmissions were slightly garbled at liftoff but that seconds
later the quality improved markedly. Using the ultra-high-frequency system,
Slayton was able to maintain crisp contact with <I>Freedom 7</I>. Shepard and
Slayton stayed on UHF, using the Cape antenna, but then as distance increased,
voice communications deteriorated. In Mercury Control Center the communications
technician monitoring the Grand Bahama Island antenna reception switched Slayton
onto a relay from Bahama, and Shepard came in loud and clear once again. Slayton
and Shepard communicated well with each other until main parachute deployment.
The Mercury Control Center communicator then tried unsuccessfully to use
Cardfile 23, the communications relay airplane. Having lost contact with Cap
Com, Shepard had expected the recovery forces to garble the radio in competition
to talk with him, but circuit discipline was businesslike both before and after
countdown.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>

<H3>Precipitation From MR-3</H3>The "unqualified" success of the Shepard
suborbital flight brought immense joy and satisfaction to the managers,
engineers, associates, and astronauts of the Space Task Group. They had labored
almost two and a half years for this first triumph. Flight failures, schedule
slippages, press criticism, and most recently the U.S.S.R.&rsquo;s attainment of the
first orbital flight, all had tempered the pride of [361] the Mercury team. But
May 5, 1961, saw the Nation rejoice with relief and pleasure in the success and
safety of Alan Shepard. President Kennedy's shore-to-ship radio telephone call
to the astronaut was spontaneous, though difficult to link, and symbolic of the
American mood that day. Although the seven-member corps of astronauts had combat
records and test-pilot experience to their credit, one of them at last was truly
a hero and not just a celebrity.
<P>In the aftermath of the flight of <I>Freedom 7</I>, Gilruth once again
published a morale memorandum for his staff. This time the subject was not a
single favorable newspaper article, as had been the case of a story by Los
Angeles newspaperman Marvin Miles the year before, but a compilation of formal
congratulations to Alan Shepard from individuals in various walks of life,
including the King of Morocco and a group of scientists in Peru.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
<P>At the postflight press conference, Admiral Hilles quipped that the space
race had turned into a world series played with a space ball, and that the Navy,
naturally, had "caught the crucial fly." But the much more impressive Gagarin
flight tempered everyone's pride but the Soviets&rsquo;. What most enhanced the United
States' prestige was not the technical prowess exhibited by MR-3 but the
contrast between the open-door policy toward news coverage of its flight and the
impenetrable secrecy surrounding the Soviet program.
<P>One result of all this publicity was a widespread skepticism toward the space
claims of the U.S.S.R. Many people around the world questioned whether a Red
cosmonaut had flown at all. An Istanbul newspaper called <I>Millyet</I>, for
example, reported that Turkish journalists, after viewing official films of both
Shepard's and Gagarin's flights, asked of the Soviet consul general, "In the
Shepard film we followed all phases of his flight, but in yours we followed only
Khrushchev. Why don't you show us your space flight, too?" A Tass correspondent,
replying for the consul general, was quoted as having explained, "We are mainly
interested in the people's excitement and reaction. This is what we wanted you
to see."<A
href="notes.htm#n11.34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
Premier Nikita Khrushchev was supposed to have been much chagrined because the
"up and down" flight of Shepard gained such extensive media publicity even
though Gagarin had long since orbited the world.
<P>Although NASA had kept a few secrets - such as ground-control command
frequencies and persisting classifications of old military data - the agency
made reasonable efforts to cooperate with newsmen.

<P class="caption">President Kennedy presents the NASA Distinguished Service
Medal to Astronaut Shepard in the White House Rose Garden. They are flanked by

</DIV>

<P>[362] The President awarded NASA's Distinguished Service Medal to Alan
Shepard in a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House on May 8. Although little
notice was given, crowds of people lined Pennsylvania Avenue, cheering the
veteran Navy pilot and new spaceman as he rode to the Capitol for lunch and
back. Here and abroad, millions of people later filed by an itinerant NASA
display to inspect <I>Freedom 7</I> at close hand. Members of Congress sensed a
formidable change in the public's attitude toward the space program. In place of
widespread apathy or lack of understanding toward space exploration, many of
their constituents now seemed aware of the meaning of the adventures into the
space void. Congressmen who had been reviewing manned space flight plans and
proposals since early April began thinking about increased allocations of
national resources, such as scientific manpower, for future manned space
exploration.
<P>On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy presented a special message to Congress on
"urgent national needs." At one point he spoke of space and of Shepard:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now is the time to take longer strides - time for a great new
  American enterprise - time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in
  space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth.
  <P>I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary. But the facts
  of the matter are that we have never made the national decision or marshalled
  the national resources required for such leadership. We have never specified
  long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our
  time so as to insure their fulfillment.
  <P>Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket
  engines . . . and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead
  for some time to come in still more impressive successes, we nevertheless are
  required to make new efforts on our own. For while we cannot guarantee that we
  shall one day be first, we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort
  will make us last. We take an additional risk by making it in full view of the
  world, but as shown by the feat of Astronaut Shepard, this very risk enhances
  our stature when we are successful. . . .
  <P>I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before
  this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to
  the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to
  mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none
  will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.<A
  href="notes.htm#n11.35"><SUP>35</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>The
Congress, believing that the American people were also ready to support an
expanded and ambitious long-term space exploration program, quickly endorsed
these words of leadership from President Kennedy. Project Apollo shifted from a
circumlunar expedition plan to a lunar landing endeavor, to be achieved before
1970, or "before this decade is out."
<P>All through March, April, and May, members of the space committees of the
Senate and the House busily quizzed James E. Webb, Dryden, Seamans, and other
leaders of NASA about the implications of the Russian program and about how the
planned time for the development of Apollo could be cut in half. But the
appropriations debate was brief. By August 7, the Senators and Representatives
[363] had agreed on $1,671,750,000 for NASA's fiscal 1962 budget. This was the
first time Congress had appropriated over a billion dollars for NASA's space
program at one time. Only $113 million less than President Kennedy had
requested, this billion and a half dollars was but an initial appropriation, for
the legislators understood that NASA would ask for a supplement about January
1962.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
<P>Thus American aspirations in space, personalized by Astronaut Shepard on May
5 and codified by President Kennedy's endorsement of NASA's follow-on plans on
May 25, 1961, gained clear direction, ample funds, and official sanction. The
national mood for space had definitely changed from what it had been at the
uncertain beginning of the Kennedy administration. A goal of developing space
technology for space exploration was a tangible means to "get the country moving
again."
<P>Industries born of the frantic missile race of the mid-fifties would turn
more and more to space-related research and development. Unlike military
technology, such products were not needed in quantity; reliable performance was
their highest criterion. Whereas Project Mercury, toward the end of its
manufacturing phase in June 1961, supposedly affected approximately one out of
90 people in the United States through industrial support of some 10,000
companies, Project Apollo as redefined by NASA and approved by the President
would take far more of a national effort.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
Kennedy had promised that expanded conquest of space would be difficult and
costly. But so impressive and dramatic an enterprise was Apollo, so full of
engineering and gadgetry, that the project seemed made to order for a new
American destiny. To President Kennedy, the United States could win an open
competition with the Soviet Union in space because of the inherent superiority
of an open society.
<P>Besides its portents, the President's decision had an immediate impact on the
Space Task Group, an organization that had been studying the possibilities of
advanced manned flight as early as 1959. In September 1960, the Apollo projects
office formally appeared on the organization chart of the Space Task Group's
Flight Systems Division, indicating the fulltime status of planners for Apollo.
But the day after President Kennedy's speech of May 25, Wesley L. Hjornevik,
formerly Glennan's administrative assistant and now Gilruth's, signed a notice
to the Space Task Group that reassured the Mercury team of a future with Apollo.
New funds and facilities, if approved by Congress as expected, would certainly
affect the personal lives of the Space Task Group members by the necessity to
reorganize and perhaps to relocate.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<P>NASA Headquarters had recognized for some time that a center was needed to
survey the whole spectrum of manned space flight programs. On January 3, 1961,
the Space Task Group had at last been designated an autonomous field element, no
longer to be considered a part of the Goddard Space Flight Center. The Space
Task Group's personnel strength had increased to a total of 794 people in
mid-1961. Until Kennedy's lunar landing decision was [364] endorsed by the
Congress, the Space Task Group had had only one responsibility, Project Mercury,
and no authorization to proceed with more ambitious endeavors. The end of
Project Mercury could have meant the end of the Space Task Group.
<P>But President Kennedy's clarion message to Congress verified a new course for
the Space Task Group's civil servants. Back in February 1961, Gilruth had asked
his second in command, Charles J. Donlan, to begin considering the most feasible
programs to succeed Project Mercury. Whatever the future programs were, they
would require new, separate, functional facilities. By May a draft study was
completed on how such undertakings should be managed. Entitled "Organizational
Concepts and Staffing Requirements" for a "Manned Spacecraft Development
Center," the study declared in its preamble:
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the essential elements required to implement an aggressive
  national effort for manned space exploration is a capability within government
  to conceive, manage, and technically monitor the development of large manned
  spacecraft and to operate the spacecraft and related ground support equipment.
  This portion of the total job is in itself one of the largest, if not the
  largest research and development job ever undertaken in war or peace.
  <P>The nucleus of the capability now exists in the Space Task Group, which has
  handled, with industry and other government resources, the Mercury Program.
  However, a program of the much larger magnitude now contemplated would require
  a substantial expansion of staff and facilities and instituting an
  organizational and management concept consistent with the magnitude of the
  program. How - and how effective - the capability is organized will have a
  direct bearing on the success or failure of the total program.<A
  href="notes.htm#n11.39"><SUP>39</SUP></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Only
a few days had elapsed after President Kennedy's call to Congress for approval
of the lunar landing program when the rank and file members of the Space Task
Group began to read speculations in their local Virginia newspapers about where
they might have to move. Few were eager to leave the Virginia peninsula. Many
were glad to stop worrying about a move to Beltsville, Maryland, but no one knew
what the alternative site would be. While wives and families fretted, the men
and women of the Space Task Group were busier than ever before, because the
group had just entered the final manned phase of the Mercury program. In August
1961, NASA Headquarters ordered John F. Parsons, Associate Director of the Ames
Research Center, to head a survey team to recommend the permanent location for a
manned spacecraft center. One of the members of the Parsons team, Martin Byrnes,
was subsequently assigned to study relocation programs for STG's members.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
<P>Responsibilities lay heavily upon STG. It had to accelerate the Mercury
program to achieve its primary objective, manned orbital flight. It should start
to recruit personnel and organize activities for the newly authorized Project
Apollo. And, most immediately, it must carry out the second suborbital Mercury
flight as scheduled. Once the next astronaut was recovered, the operations team
in concert with the Space Task Group management would have to decide just how
far to carry the Mercury-Redstone suborbital program. Many of the 30 or so [365]
who had attended Shepard's postflight debriefing felt that this phase had served
its purpose and that now the manned orbital phase should be initiated. This
point was discussed in June but not by any means decided. From Shepard's
success, however, one thing seemed clear: it was certainly not necessary to
train all the astronauts on suborbital flights before trying to duplicate or
triplicate Gagarin's feat.

<H3>Second Suborbital Trial</H3>Preparation for the second suborbital flight of
man into space was essentially the same as that for Shepard and <I>Freedom
7</I>. Much of the astronaut and ground support training, spacecraft checkout,
and booster preparation had been accomplished concurrently with the grooming of
MR-3, since the anticipated six-week interval was too short to begin anew. Thus
Air Force Captain Virgil I. Grissom, told by Gilruth in January 1961 that he
would probably be the pilot for Mercury-Redstone 4, and John H. Glenn, Jr., once
again the suborbital backup pilot, returned to work quickly after Shepard's
flight. In April all three had undergone refresher centrifuge training at
Johnsville, and now they were well fortified to endure the actual Redstone
acceleration profile.
<P>Most of their training period was spent at the Cape so that Grissom and Glenn
could follow the technical progress of spacecraft and launch vehicle by
participating in minute checkout operations. In Hangar S the astronauts
exercised themselves and all their capsule systems in the simulated
high-altitude chamber tests. Their physicians recorded metabolic data and
refined physiological reactions. Communication checks, manual control system
checks, sequence system verifications, and many simulated missions in the
procedures trainer kept them busy. Twice Grissom and Glenn went back to Langley
for sessions in the ALFA trainer. In all, each simulated about 100
Mercury-Redstone flights before the upcoming MR-4 launch, scheduled for July.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
<P>Spacecraft No. 11, designated since October for the second manned Mercury
flight, had come off the production line at McDonnell in May 1960. As the first
operational capsule with a centerline window, No. 11 more nearly approximated
the orbital version of the Mercury capsule than Shepard's <I>Freedom 7</I>, or
spacecraft No. 7.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
<P>Among other innovations in No. 11 for MR-4 was an explosive side hatch, whose
evolution, encouraged by the astronaut corps, had begun early in the Mercury
program. The original egress procedure had been to climb out through the antenna
compartment, a difficult maneuver that required the removal of a small pressure
bulkhead. Since all the astronauts had found it hard to snake out the top of the
frustum and cylinder, the STG and McDonnell designers had concluded that removal
of an injured astronaut would be even more precarious. Moreover, valuable time
would be lost in such a rescue [367] operation; to open the hatch from the
outside, someone had to remove several shingles and 70 bolts.

</DIV>

<P>McDonnell engineers set to work on the problem and came up with two egress
hatch models - one with a latch, which was used on Ham's MR-2 and Shepard's MR-3
missions, the other with an explosive hatch cover. The simple latch mechanism
weighed 69 pounds, too much of a weight addition for incorporation in the
orbital version of the spacecraft. The explosive hatch, on the other hand,
utilized the 70 bolts of the original design; a .06-inch hole was bored into
each of the quarter-inch titanium bolts to provide a weak point. When a mild
detonating fuse, placed in a groove around each bolt, was energized, the bolts
were sheared simultaneously and the hatch sprang open.
<P>There were two ways to activate the explosive egress hatch during recovery.
About six to eight inches from the astronaut's right arm, as he lay in his
couch, was a knobbed plunger. The pilot would remove a pin and press the plunger
with a fist-force of five or six pounds, detonating the small explosive charge
and blasting the hatch 25 feet away in a second. If the pin was in place, a
fist-force of 40 pounds was required. A rescuer outside the capsule could blow
open the hatch simply by removing a small panel from the fuselage side and
pulling a lanyard. This complete explosive hatch weighed only 23 pounds.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
<P>The welcome new trapezoidal window assembly on spacecraft No. 11 replaced the
two 10-inch side ports through which Shepard strained to see. The pilot now
could look upward slightly and see directly outside. Visually the field covered
30 degrees in the horizontal plane and 33 degrees in the vertical. The Corning
Glass Works of Corning, New York, designed and developed the multilayered panes.
The outer pane was made of Vycor glass, .35-inch thick, and could withstand
temperatures on the order of 1500 to 1800 degrees F. Three panels were bonded to
make the inner pane, one a .17-inch-thick sheet of Vycor, the two others made
of tempered glass. This fenestration was as strong as any part of the capsule
pressure vessel.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
<P>The manual controls for the second manned flight incorporated the new rate
stabilization control system. With it the astronaut could control the rate of
spacecraft attitude movements by small turns of his hand controller rather than
by jockeying the device to attain the desired position. This rate damping or
rate augmentation system, like power steering on an automobile, gave finer and
easier handling qualities and another redundant means of driving the pitch, yaw,
and roll thrusters.
<P>By the time of the MR-4 flight, Lewis Research Center and Space Task Group
engineers had analyzed the thrust rating of the posigrade rockets and had made a
valuable discovery. Fired into the booster-spacecraft adapter, the posigrade
rockets developed 78 percent greater thrust than when fired openly. Accordingly
the capsule separation rockets when ignited inside the adapter, producing what
the NASA testers called a "popgun effect," afforded an initial [368] separation
velocity of about 28.1 feet per second. This determination provided the
engineers with the confidence that spacecraft-booster separation would occur
with little likelihood of recontact.
<P>STG's calculations indicated that the Redstone booster and the Mercury
spacecraft should be about 4000 feet apart on their suborbital trajectory at
retrofire. The unbraked booster would hit the water some 566.2 seconds after
launch, while the longer and steeper trajectory of the spacecraft would keep it
aloft 911.1 seconds. The booster would land about 16&frac12; miles beyond the
spacecraft.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
Because of the relatively short distance between the two impact points, STG was
concerned enough to assign John P. Mayer and Ted H. Skopinski to study the
problem, especially as related to possible recontact of the spacecraft and the
booster after separation. As a result of the studies, Skopinski's
recommendations for minor changes in the sequencing of retrofire were accepted
as solutions to prevent recontact.
<P>Other hardware changes involved attaching a redesigned fairing for the
capsule adapter clamp-ring, rearranging the capsule instrument panel, and adding
more foam padding to the head area of the contour couch. The fairing and some
more insulation should overcome the vibration and consequent blurred vision
Shepard had complained about, while the rearrangement of the instruments sought
to improve the eye-scan pattern, which Shepard had found poor. These changes
cost several more weeks' time. On July 15, 1961, Gilruth affirmed that Grissom
would be the prime pilot for Mercury-Redstone No. 4 and that Glenn would be his
stand-in. Grissom in turn announced that he had chosen the name <I>Liberty Bell
7</I> as the most appropriate call-sign for his bell-shaped capsule, because the
name was to Americans almost synonymous with "freedom" and symbolic numerically
of the continuous teamwork it represented.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
<P>Modifications made on Grissom's pressure suit reflected the experiences of
Shepard's flight. Nylon-sealed ball-bearing rings were fitted at the glove
connections to allow full rotation of the wrists while the suit was pressurized.
A new personal parachute harness was designed to keep the chute out of the way.
On the chest of Grissom's suit was a convex mirror, called a "hero's medal" by
the astronaut corps, that served simply to allow the pilot-observer camera to
photograph instrument readings. Another welcome addition to the suit was a urine
reservoir, fabricated the day before the flight. Although during his flight
Grissom would find the contraption somewhat binding, it did work. Lastly,
Grissom's helmet was equipped with new microphones that promised to filter out
more noise and make transmission quality even better.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
<P>Materials successfully used in other phases of the space program also became
a part of the second manned flight. In the continuing quest for weight
reduction, a lightweight, radar-reflective life raft was developed jointly by
the Langley Research Center and the Space Task Group. Weighing three pounds and
four ounces (45 percent lighter than the original version), this raft was
constructed [369] of Mylar and nylon, the same materials used in <I>Echo I</I>,
the passive communication satellite balloon that began circling the globe in
August 1960. The survival pack, with the raft inside, was secured on a shelf in
the spacecraft conveniently near the astronaut's left arm.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
<P>Grissom's flight plan was revised rapidly and altered substantially as a
result of MR-3. Shepard had really been overloaded with activities during his
five minutes of weightlessness. Now Grissom was given a chance to look through
his new trapezoidal window to learn more about man's visual abilities in space.
If he could recognize landmarks for flight reference, the pilot tasks for the
Mercury orbital flights might be considerably simplified. Shepard had assumed
manual control of only one axis of movement - yaw, pitch, or roll - at a time,
whereas Grissom had instructions to assume complete manual control as soon as he
could, to make three maneuvers in about one minute instead of Shepard's 12
minutes, and then to spend as much time as possible making exterior
observations.
<P>Mercury-Redstone booster No. 8 had arrived at Cape Canaveral on June 8. Kurt
H. Debus' contingent of Wernher von Braun's team and G. Merritt Preston's
capsule checkout team had proceeded with the mating of the launch vehicle and
capsule and the checkout requirements. On July 13, the flight safety review was
held and the spacecraft was pronounced ready for flight. Two days later Walter
Williams heard the reports during the mission review; the Redstone and
<I>Liberty Bell 7</I> were pronounced ready to go. The recovery ships,
anticipating the launch date on Tuesday, July 18, moved into their assigned
positions.
<P>Essentially a repeat of MR-3, Grissom's flight was to reach an apogee of 116
miles, over a range of 299 miles, with the astronaut feeling a maximum
acceleration load of 6.33 g and deceleration of 10.96 g. Only the launching
azimuth, changed by three degrees to stay within range bounds, varied from
Shepard's flight into space.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>
<P>On July 16 the news media received a weather bulletin predicting that the
cloud cover in the launch area for the next 48 hours would be below average, but
that the impact area would be slightly cloudier than usual. The mission was
postponed early Tuesday, the 18th, in hope of better weather. Fortunately the
frosty liquid oxygen had not been loaded so the launch delay was only 24, rather
than 48, hours.
<P>Early Wednesday, July 19, Grissom, asleep in his quarters on the balcony of
Hangar S, was awakened by his physician, William Douglas, who told him that
Walter Williams' operations team was pushing for a 7 a.m. launch to beat the
weather. The launch day routine began again. By 5 a.m. Grissom was up in the
gantry. He slid into his niche; the count resumed and continued unbroken until
10 minutes and 30 seconds before launch, when a hold was called to wait for a
rift in the cloud cover. When no break appeared, the mission was scrubbed again.
This time the liquid oxygen had been tanked, so a dreary 48-hour delay would be
necessary.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
<P>The weather conditions on July 21 were still not ideal. The view from an
[370] altitude of a hundred miles would show that all the northern portion of
Florida was completely obscured by high cirrus and lower patches of cumulus
clouds. Southern Florida and Cuba would be splotched by scattered cumulus. The
operations team nevertheless decided that since the view was not essential to
the success of the mission, the launch should come off as scheduled.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
<P>Because Grissom had shaved and showered before going to bed rather than
before his low-residue breakfast, and because Slayton, the blockhouse
communicator, briefed the astronaut on the status of the capsule and booster
during the van ride to the pad rather than just before gantry ascent, the
routine was a bit less hurried. George E. Ruff, an Air Force psychiatrist, had
time to interrogate Grissom about his feelings before he lay in his contour
couch for MR-4's liftoff.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
<P>Grissom was unruffled, calm, and poised as he entered <I>Liberty Bell 7</I>
again. The count resumed and proceeded smoothly until 45 minutes before launch
time, when a gantry technician discovered that one of the 70 hatch bolts was
misaligned. A 30-minute hold was called, during which the McDonnell and STG
supervisory engineers decided that the remaining 69 bolts were sufficient to
hold and blow the hatch, so the misaligned bolt was not replaced. The countdown
was resumed, but two more holds for minor reasons cost another hour's wait.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>Alone in his capsule awaiting liftoff, Grissom experienced a wide range of
impressions. As the gantry, or service structure, moved back from the launch
vehicle, he had the illusion that he was falling. His pulse rate ranged from 64
to 162 beats per minute, depending upon his feelings. His heart beat rose during
the oxygen purge, fell while the hatch bolt repair decision was being made, rose
again when the go decision was made, and finally doubled at launch. His liftoff
was at 7:20 a.m.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>

<H3>Liberty Bell Tolls</H3>Grissom later admitted at the postflight debriefing
that he was "a bit scared" at liftoff, but he added that he soon gained
confidence along with the g buildup. Hearing the engine roar at the pedestal, he
thought that his elapsed-time clock had started late. Like Shepard, he was
amazed at the smooth quality of the liftoff, but then he noticed gradually more
severe vibrations, never violent enough to impair his vision. To the watchers on
the ground, the Redstone and the capsule appeared to rise slowly and to pass
through a thin, broken cloud window. Then the rocket disappeared, leaving a
contrail that was visible on the beach for about a minute. Grissom's cabin
pressure sealed off at the proper altitude, about 27,000 feet, and he felt
elated that the environmental control system was in good working order. The suit
and cabin temperature, about 57.5 and 97 degrees F, respectively, were quite
comfortable. Watching his instruments for the pitch rate of the Redstone,
Grissom saw it follow directions as programmed, tilting over about one degree
per second.
<P>[371] Under a 3-g load on the up-leg of his flight, Grissom noticed a sudden
change in the color of the horizon from light blue to jet black. His attention
was distracted by the noise of the tower-jettison rocket firing on schedule. The
pilot felt the separation and watched the tower through the window as it drifted
off, trailing smoke, to his right. At two minutes and 22 seconds after launch,
the Redstone's Rocketdyne engine cut off after building a velocity of 6561 feet
per second. Grissom had a strong sensation of tumbling during the transition
from high to zero g, and, while he had become familiar with this sensation in
centrifuge training, for a moment he lost his bearings.
<P>The Redstone coasted for 10 seconds after its engine cut off; then a sharp
report signaled that the posigrade rockets were popping the capsule loose from
the booster. Although Grissom peered out his window throughout his ship's
turnaround maneuver, he never caught sight of his launch vehicle. Angular motion
was perceptible to Grissom only by watching the needle move on the dial or by
seeing an Earth reference by chance. Another cue to the spacecraft's movement
was the Sun's rays, which gradually moved up his torso toward his face,
threatening temporary blindness. Grissom fretted over the automatic turnaround
that should have reversed the capsule faster.
<P>With turnaround accomplished, the Air Force jet pilot for the first time
became a space pilot, assuming manual-proportional control. A constant urge to
look out the window made concentrating on his control tasks difficult. He told
Shepard back in Mercury Control that the panorama of Earth's horizon, presenting
an 800-mile arc at peak altitude, was fascinating. His instruments rated a poor
second to the spectacle below.
<P>Turning reluctantly to his dials and control stick, Grissom made a pitch
movement change but was past his desired mark. He jockeyed the handcontroller
stick for position, trying to damp out all oscillations, then made a yaw
movement and went too far in that direction. By the time the proper attitude was
attained, the short time allocated for these maneuvers had been used, so he
omitted the roll movement altogether. The manual controls impressed Grissom as
very sluggish when compared to the Mercury procedures trainer. Then he switched
to the new rate command control system and found perfect response, although fuel
consumption was high.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
<P>After the pitch and yaw maneuvers, Grissom made a roll-over movement so he
could see the ground from his window. Some land beneath the clouds (later
determined to be western Florida around the Apalachicola area) appeared in the
hazy distance, but the pilot was unable to identify it. Suddenly Cape Canaveral
came into view so clearly that Grissom found it hard to believe that his
slant-range was over 150 miles.
<P>He saw Merritt Island, the Banana River, the Indian River, and what appeared
to be a large airport runway. South of Cape Canaveral, he saw what he believed
to be West Palm Beach. He tried to report to Shepard on the high-frequency [372]
communications circuit every landmark he saw, but his transmissions were not
received. These observations got Grissom behind in his work procedures, as he
realized when he saw the periscope retract.
<P>With <I>Liberty Bell 7</I> at an altitude of 118.26 miles, it was now time to
position the spacecraft in its reentry attitude. Grissom had initiated the
retrorocket sequence and the capsule was arcing downward. His pulse reached 171
beats per minute. Retrofire gave him the distinct and peculiar feeling that he
had reversed his backward flight through space and was actually moving face
forward. As he plummeted downward, he saw what appeared to be two of the spent
retrorockets pass across the periscope view after the retrorocket package had
been jettisoned.
<P>Pitching the spacecraft over into a reentry attitude of 14 degrees from
Earth-vertical, the pilot tried to see the stars out his observation window.
Instead the glare of sunlight filled his capsule, making it difficult to read
the panel dials, particularly those with blue lights. Grissom felt that he would
not have noticed the .05-g light if he had not known it was about to flash on.
<P>Reentry presented no problem. Grissom could not feel the oscillations
following the g buildup; he could only read them on the rate indicators.
Meanwhile he continued to report to the Mercury Control Center on his electric
current reading, fuel quantity, g loads, and other instrument indications.
Condensation and smoke trailed off the heatshield at about 65,000 feet as
<I>Liberty Bell 7</I> plunged back into the atmosphere.
<P>The drogue parachute deployed on schedule at 21,000 feet. Grissom said he saw
the deployment and felt some resulting pulsating motion, but not enough to worry
him. Main parachute deployment occurred at 12,300 feet, which was about 1000
feet higher than the design nominal altitude. Watching the main chute unfurl,
Grissom spotted a six-inch L-shaped tear and another two-inch puncture in the
canopy. Although he worried about them, the holes grew no bigger and his rate of
descent soon slowed to about 28 feet per second. Dumping his peroxide control
fuel, the pilot began transmitting his panel readings.
<P>A "clunk" confirmed that the landing bag had dropped in preparation for
impact. Grissom then removed his oxygen hose and opened his visor but
deliberately left the suit ventilation hose attached. Impact was milder than he
had expected, although the capsule heeled over in the water until Grissom was
lying on his left side. He thought he was facing downward. The capsule gradually
righted itself, and, as the window cleared the water, Grissom jettisoned the
reserve parachute and activated the rescue aids switch. <I>Liberty Bell 7</I>
still appeared watertight, although it was rolling badly with the swells.
<P>Preparing for recovery, he disconnected his helmet and checked himself for
debarkation. The neck dam did not unroll easily; Grissom tinkered with his suit
collar to ensure his buoyancy if he had to get out of the spacecraft quickly.
When the recovery helicopters, which had taken to the air at launch time and
visually followed the contrails and parachute descent, were still about two
miles [373] from the impact point, which was only three miles beyond the
bullseye, Lieutenant James L. Lewis, pilot of the primary recovery helicopter,
radioed Grissom to ask if he was ready for pickup. He replied that he wanted
them to wait five minutes while he recorded his cockpit panel data. Using a
grease pencil with the pressure suit gloves was awkward, and several times the
suit ventilation caused the neck dam to balloon, but the pilot simply placed his
finger between neck and dam to allow the air to escape.
<P>After logging the panel data, Grissom asked the helicopters to begin the
approach for pickup. He removed the pin from the hatch-cover detonator and lay
back in the dry couch. "I was lying there, minding my own business," he said
afterward, "when I heard a dull thud." The hatch cover blew away, and salt water
swished into the capsule as it bobbed in the ocean. The third man to return from
space was faced with the first serious emergency; <I>Liberty Bell 7</I> was
shipping water and sinking fast.
<P>Grissom had difficulty recollecting his actions at this point, but he was
certain that he had not touched the hatch-activation plunger. He doffed his
helmet, grasped the instrument panel with his right hand, and scurried out the
sloshing hatchway. Floating in the sea, he was thankful that he had unbuckled
himself earlier from most of his harness, including the chest restraints.
Otherwise he might not have been able to abandon ship.
<P>Lieutenant John Reinhard, copilot of the nearest recovery helicopter,
reported afterward that the choppers were making their final approach for
pickup. He was preparing to cut the capsule's antenna whip (according to a new
procedure) with a squib-actuated cutter at the end of a pole, when he saw the
hatch cover fly off, strike the water at a distance of about five feet from the
hatch, and then go skipping over the waves. Next he saw Grissom's head appear,
and the astronaut began climbing through the hatch. Once out, the
pressure-suited spaceman swam away.
<P>Instead of turning his attention to Grissom, Lewis completed his approach to
the sinking spacecraft, as both he and Reinhard were intent on capsule recovery.
This action was a conditioned reflex based on past training experience. While
training off the Virginia beaches the helicopter pilots had noted that the
astronauts seemed at home in and to enjoy the water. So Reinhard quickly clipped
the high-frequency antenna as soon as the helicopter reached <I>Liberty Bell
7</I>. Throwing aside the antenna cutting device, Reinhard picked up the
shepherd's hook recovery pole and carefully threaded the crook through the
recovery loop on top of the capsule. By this time Lewis had lowered the
helicopter to assist Reinhard in his task to a point that the chopper's three
wheels were in the water. <I>Liberty Bell 7</I> sank out of sight, but the
pickup pole twanged as the attached cable went taut, indicating to the
helicopter pilots that they had made their catch.
<P>Reinhard immediately prepared to pass the floating astronaut the personnel
hoist. But at that moment Lewis called a warning that a detector light had
flashed on the instrument panel, indicating that metal chips were in the oil
sump [375] because of engine strain. Considering the implication of impending
engine failure, Lewis told Reinhard to retract the personnel hoist while he
called the second chopper to retrieve the pilot.

<P>Meanwhile Grissom, having made certain that he was not snared by any lines,
noticed that the primary helicopter was having trouble raising the submerged
spacecraft. He swam back to the capsule to see if he could assist but found the
cable properly attached. When he looked up for the personnel line, he saw the
helicopter start to move away.
<P>Suddenly Grissom realized that he was not riding as high in the water as he
had been. All the time he had been in the water he kept feeling air escape
through the neck dam. The more air he lost, the less buoyancy he had. Moreover,
he had forgotten to secure his suit inlet valve. Swimming was becoming
difficult, and now with the second helicopter moving in he found the rotor wash
between the two aircraft was making swimming more difficult. Bobbing under the
waves, Grissom was scared, angry, and looking for a swimmer from one of the
helicopters to help him tread water. Then he caught sight of a familiar face,
that of George Cox, aboard the second helicopter. Cox was the copilot who had
retrieved both the chimpanzee Ham and Astronaut Shepard. With his head barely
above water, Grissom found the sight of Cox heartening.
<P>Cox tossed the "horse-collar" lifeline straight to Grissom, who immediately
wrapped himself into the sling backwards. Lack of orthodoxy mattered little to
Grissom now, for he was on his way to the safety of the helicopter, even though
swells dunked him twice more before he got aboard. His first thought was to get
a life preserver on. Grissom had been either swimming or floating for a period
of only four or five minutes, "although it seemed like an eternity to me," as he
said afterward.
<P>As the first helicopter moved away from Grissom, it struggled valiantly to
raise the spacecraft high enough to drain the water from the impact bag. Once
the capsule was almost clear of the water, but like an anchor it prevented the
helicopter from moving forward. The flooded <I>Liberty Bell 7</I> weighed over
5000 pounds, a thousand pounds beyond the helicopter's lifting capacity. The
pilot, watching his insistent red warning light, decided not to chance losing
two craft in one day. He finally cast loose, allowing the spacecraft to sink
swiftly. Martin Byrnes, aboard the carrier, suggested that a marker be placed at
the point so that the capsule might be recovered later. Rear Admiral J. E. Clark
advised Byrnes that in that area the depth was about 2800 fathoms.
<P>On the carrier <I>Randolph</I>, examining physicians Strong and Laning, the
same men who had gone over Shepard, found Grissom extremely tired. But the MR-4
astronaut elected to proceed with his preliminary debriefing before going on to
Grand Bahama. The recovery finale, of course, continually intruded in the
discussion. Grissom said he was extremely grateful to Walter Schirra for the
developmental work he had done on the neck dam. He felt that this had saved his
life, although later tests disclosed other difficulties. [376] The debriefing
sessions aboard the <I>Randolph</I> and at Grand Bahama centered on the need for
more egress training (there had been none since April) and the formulation of
specific emergency recovery procedures. Grissom said that he thought he should
have been a little more precise in his attitude control functions. This was a
moot point in view of the sluggishness he had encountered with the manual system
and the apparent play in the control stick linkage. Other than this anomaly, the
spacecraft had performed well; noises of the sequential events had provided good
cues; vibrations had been minimal; the new window had been a delight and should
prove useful on orbital flights; and the environmental control system had
functioned well. But, said Grissom, there were too many couch restraint straps;
the panel lights were too dim; the oxygen consumption rate was high; the urinal
device needed further development; the high-frequency communication circuit was
unsuccessful; and hydrogen peroxide fuel consumption proved to be high on the
rate control system. The last item of that list caused little concern among the
Space Task Group engineers, for they had decided that the rate command mode
would be used primarily for reentry, when fuel economy was less important.
<P>At Grand Bahama, Grissom rested and appeared to have suffered no abnormal
effects from flight into space. The evaluators conceded, however, that the
abnormal recovery experience would have made any such effects difficult to
analyze or to attribute to flight causes. Further questioning of the astronaut
followed the routine established in Shepard's debriefing.<A

<P>Obviously one of the major problems to be explained and resolved following
the flight of <I>Liberty Bell 7</I> was the malfunction of the explosive egress
hatch. Before the mission, Minneapolis-Honeywell had conducted environmental
tests to qualify the hatch and igniter assembly. Although the tests had been run
with the pin installed, conditions had been severe. The component had been
subjected to low and high temperature ranges, a 100-g shock force, and
salt-spray and water-immersion tests. After MR-4, the Space Task Group
established a committee that included Astronaut Schirra to study the hatch
problem. Tests were conducted in an environment even more severe than that used
by the manufacturer, but no premature explosions occurred. Studies were made of
individuals operating the panel switches on the side nearest the actuator; the
clearance margin appeared to be adequate. According to Schirra, "There was only
a very remote possibility that the plunger could have been actuated
inadvertently by the pilot."
<P>The mystery of Grissom's hatch was never solved to everyone's satisfaction.
Among the favorite hypotheses were that the exterior lanyard might have become
entangled with the landing bag straps; that the ring seal might have been
omitted on the detonation plunger, reducing the pressure necessary to actuate
it; or that static electricity generated by the helicopter had fired the hatch
cover. But with the spacecraft and its onboard evidence lying 15,000 feet down
on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, it was impossible to determine the true
cause. [377] The only solution was to draft a procedure that would preclude a
recurrence: henceforth the astronaut would not touch the plunger pin until the
helicopter hooked on and the line was taut. As it turned out, <I>Liberty Bell
7</I> was the last manned flight in Project Mercury in which helicopter
retrieval of the spacecraft was planned. In addition, Grissom would be the only
astronaut who used the hatch without receiving a slight hand injury. As he later
reminded Glenn, Schirra, and Cooper, this helped prove he had not touched his
hatch plunger.<A

<H3>Titov Widens the Gap</H3>Despite the loss of <I>Liberty Bell 7</I>, the
Mercury-Redstone phase of the program had been so successful that there was
little reason for keeping it alive. The termination of the manned suborbital
flights had seemed predictable after Gagarin and certain after Shepard. A month
and a half before Grissom flew, the Space Task Group had decided to cancel the
fourth such flight, MR-6. Silverstein and Gilruth also had considered canceling
the third flight, MR-5, to concentrate on Mercury-Atlas operations. But
Silverstein believed that data obtained from Grissom's MR-4 should be appraised
before deciding whether to bypass the MR-5.
<P>Besides, at that time the subject was politically sensitive. Since three
astronauts were training for the Mercury-Redstone missions, the public
expectation, expressed in Congress and through the press, was that there would
be at least three manned Redstone flights. But if Mercury-Atlas could be
expedited, an astronaut making three orbits would eclipse the cosmonaut who had
made one orbit.
<P>On August 7, 1961, all such hopes were erased by the day-long, 17-orbit
flight and successful recovery of Cosmonaut Gherman S. Titov. When the U.S.S.R.
announced its spectacular second space flight, some Americans were filled with
awe, some with admiration, and some even with fear, while a few expressed only
scornful disbelief. At 9 a.m., Moscow time, on August 6, 1961, the Soviet pilot
rocketed into orbit aboard <I>Vostok II</I>. The space voyage of this
26-year-old Russian covered 17.5 orbits and took 25 hours and 18 minutes.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
<P>After the data gathered from the Grissom flight had been evaluated, NASA and
Space Task Group managers decided that little could be gained from any further
Mercury-Redstone missions. On August 14, Paul Purser drafted a termination
recommendation for Gilruth's submittal to Silverstein. Purser pointed out that
the Redstone had done well its job of qualifying the spacecraft, astronauts, and
most other critical aspects of the operation. Mercury-Redstone also had
validated the various training devices, and it had uncovered many technical
problems, none of which appeared to be insoluble before an American orbital
flight.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
Now it was time to turn to the principal Mercury-Atlas problem areas, such as
explosive hatch, inverter heating, oxygen usage rate, control system linkage,
and egress training, and to cope with the more complex Atlas program. [378] Four
days later, on August 18, NASA Headquarters publicly announced that the
objectives of the Mercury-Redstone program had been achieved, and that
accordingly it was canceled. Six days later, Joachim P. Kuettner,
Mercury-Redstone Project Chief at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center,
told his subordinates that the Redstone must now be retired after helping gain a
toehold on space.<A

<P>Several accounts of the Soviet manned space feats indicated striking
similarities in cosmonaut and astronaut selection and training. The Russians
were chosen by a strenuous selection program, which was much like the American
procedure, but their selection emphasized youth and stamina, rather than flight
experience and engineering. Soviet training, like American, employed the human
centrifuge, altitude chamber, isolation, technical systems study, and personal
physical training. Also, three pilots trained in competition for the first
flight, Titov being Gagarin's backup pilot on <I>Vostok I</I> of April 12.
Gagarin's and Titov's accounts of liftoff and orbital flight described the same
phenomena - g-load buildup, vibrations, and impressions of weightlessness.
<P>Titov was reported to have exercised manual control. This transliteration was
taken in some circles to mean that he changed his orbital plane, but the Mercury
experts believed that Titov's manual control was for attitude only, like that
exercised by Shepard and Grissom. Titov reported sleeping seven hours or more,
and some translations indicated that he was awakened by his weightless arms
floating. This last claim was too much for David Lawrence, a syndicated
columnist, who suggested that the flight might have been a hoax. But the members
of the Space Task Group never doubted the authenticity of either <I>Vostok I</I>
or <I>Vostok II</I>. Too much was similar. Although only two or three people in
the Space Task Group could read Russian, the reports translated from Soviet
journals seemed to correspond to their own experience.
<P>One of Titov's publicized problems caused concern among NASA and Space Task
Group medical specialists. Before entering his rest period, Titov complained of
feelings "akin to seasickness" and became nauseated. He had to be careful not to
move his head too swiftly in any direction. After sleep, his nausea apparently
abated; it finally disappeared completely when Titov began to feel reentry
pressures. NASA aeromedical advisers suggested that the first American in
orbital flight ought to guard against, watch for, and test out this peculiar
physiological reaction reported by Titov and the Soviets.<A
href="notes.htm#n11.61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
<P>Psychologically, the Russian Vostok feats created some uneasiness in the
United States. Many people admired the Soviet's technological proficiency but
were concerned by the strategic implications. The fact that Titov's orbital
track in a near-polar plane carried him over the United States three times was
alarming to some people. In spite of the fact that the decision for the
accelerated space program was confirmed, the term "space lag" began appearing
more frequently in the press and in the statements of some Congressmen.
Criticism of NASA, the departed Eisenhower administration, and even the Kennedy
administration mounted. After the Gagarin flight, for example, Democratic
Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri caustically pointed to the years of
indecision that had so long delayed the Saturn launch vehicle. After the Titov
flight, John W. Finney, aerospace and science writer for the <I>New York
Times</I>, pictured Washington officialdom as carping over NASA's "easy pace" in
implementing the lunar landing program outlined by President Kennedy. No
specifications for a lunar spacecraft yet were evident; no agreement on the
route to take or on the necessary launch vehicle had been reached. But these
were mostly NASA Headquarters worries; the primary task of the Space Task Group
still lay ahead. Regardless of the fact that Mercury could now only duplicate
the feats of the Vostoks, Project Apollo, the manned lunar-landing project,
depended upon Mercury Mark II (later named Gemini), the two-man rendezvous and
docking project; and Gemini depended upon the fulfillment of Mercury; in turn,
that depended upon the strength and stability of Atlas. The day Titov came back
to Earth, NASA's Space Task Group announced candidly, if not calmly, that the
first try at putting an American in orbit might slip unavoidably into January
1962.<A
