<H1>Head and Hands of NASA</H1>During March and April, Administrator Glennan 
called on the Space Task Group, as well as all of NASA, to conduct a 
self-appraisal of NASA's contracting policy and industrial relations. A firm of 
management consultants, McKinsey and Company, had entered into a contract with 
NASA on February 26, 1960, for a comprehensive study of how NASA should utilize 
industry and private institutions, how it could improve its utilization of its 
own research capability, and what the extent and manner of sharing 
responsibility and authority between Government and industry actually was.<A

<P>The Space Task Group responded with a self-analysis which listed the major 
[261] elements of Project Mercury, gave an explanation of the major tasks 
involved, and discussed the reasons for performing each task within NASA or on 
contract. The preliminary draft of this information divided the tasks of the 
Task Group into three subsystems - the capsule, boosters, and tracking and 
communications - each of which was further subdivided into elements and tasks. 
When the representative of McKinsey and Company visited STG on April 19 to 
discuss the working methods used in the conduct of Project Mercury, he was 
briefed by Purser, Zavasky, Mathews, and Bond, and provided with documents 
tabulating the distribution of STG personnel man-years, associated costs, and "R 
and D" fundings. Although McKinsey's final report did not appear until October, 
the Task Group finished its part of the self-examination in May. STG learned 
from this exercise that it had shifted from research and development into almost 
exclusively development activities.<A

<P>At the highest level within NASA Glennan and associates recognized, as Robert 
Rosholt has described it, that the "opportunity to make comprehensive changes in 
NASA's organization and procedures would not exist too much longer, i.e., 
bureaucratic hardening of the arteries would make change more and more difficult 
as the agency became older and larger." The final McKinsey report appeared to 
endorse the "integrated project management team" approach used by STG. The Space 
Task Group, however, was still only a semi-independent subdivision of NASA's 
Goddard center and still closely related to the Langley center. The General 
Accounting Office and NASA had clashed recently over executive privilege in 
withholding certain documents relating to the selection of McDonnell as the 
prime contractor for Mercury. This furnished ammunition for some critics of 
NASA's industrial relations. But the decentralization policy of NASA was 
approved by McKinsey, with certain reservations taken in part from STG's 
experience.<A

<P>Through the winter and spring of 1960 the managers of Mercury both in 
Washington and in Virginia were learning to adjust to the limits imposed by a 
new technology and by the necessity to coordinate diverse, far-flung, and 
sometimes perverse human organizations of technicians and craftsmen. While they 
chafed at the slipping schedules, worried over technical details, swatted at 
gadfly reporters, and tried to anticipate every contingency in their planning 
for the missions ahead, Gilruth and his associates in management and systems 
engineering were just as surely learning to take their tumbles as were the 
astronauts in their centrifuge rides and in other exotic simulators.
<P>McDonnell's capsule No. 1 finally arrived at Wallops Island on April 1, 1960, 
cleaned up but stripped of most of its subsystems, to be groomed for a test of 
its escape rocket, parachute recovery, and landing system. Petynia and Dennis F. 
Hasson had written a thick catalog of expectations, prescribed procedures, 
schematics, and checkoff lists for this "off-the-pad abort" test. While Alan 
Kehlet and Herbert G. Patterson worried over alignment and the abort sequence 
system, Wallops personnel prepared the canted pad and supplied logistical 
support [262] to the McDonnell and Task Group engineers for a month of 
preparation. Shake tests and sled tests were run first to ensure readiness 
before firing.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-8.htm#source89"><SUP>89</SUP></A>
<P>Finally on May 9 the carefully weighed and balanced capsule pointed its pylon 
toward the sea. The ignition switch was closed and the escape rocket jerked the 
capsule away from the ground on its short flight, lasting one minute and 16 
seconds but covering half a mile in an arc 2465 feet high. Recovery by a Marine 
Corps helicopter took only 17 minutes. The only significant defect noted from 
this test was a relatively poor separation distance when the tower jettisoned.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-8.htm#source90"><SUP>90</SUP></A>
<P>The "beach abort" was a successful flight and a sterling qualification test, 
but it was hardly spectacular to the public. Certainly it was not all that STG 
had hoped to accomplish this long after the last of the development flights late 
in January. However, MA-1 was coming along nicely. It should be far more 
impressive in proving the "booster-capsule combination for exit flight and 
capsule for entry flight."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-8.htm#source91"><SUP>91</SUP></A> 
And spacecraft No. 2 was to be delivered to Huntsville at the end of June for 
static tests and compatibility adjustments with the first Redstone booster. 
Should it prove trouble-free, then presumably by the end of summer, if everyone 
worked hard enough and there were no interfering defense launch commitments, two 
more qualification flights on each of the big boosters should bring the day of 
the first manned space flight much closer.
<P>On May 15, 1960, however, an event occurred that rekindled premonitions that 
the first manned space flight might be made by a Russian. In their only 
announced space launching during the first half of 1960, the Soviets orbited the 
first capsule large enough (10,011 pounds) to contain a human passenger. Called 
merely <I>Sputnik IV</I> by the Western press but more accurately named 
<I>Korabl Sputnik</I>, or <I>Cosmic Ship No. 1</I>, this vehicle failed four 
days later when its reaction control or attitude control system shot the ship 
containing its dummy astronaut the wrong way for recovery.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch8-8.htm#source92"><SUP>92</SUP></A> 
Perhaps, just perhaps, the United States might have better reaction and attitude 
controls than the Soviet Union.

<P><A name=source88><SUP>88</SUP></A> Rosholt, <I>Administrative History of 
NASA</I>, 154, 101, 124; Rosholt has paraphrased the McKinsey report as follows 
(pp. 157-158):
<P>&ldquo;The report revealed that NASA's record in supervising its out-of-house 
efforts was spotty. Difficulties had arisen because NASA neglected certain basic 
prerequisites to effective contractor supervision, such as adequate statements 
of work, sufficient and flexible funding, and properly focused technical 
responsibility. (A basic problem in connection with the last named prerequisite 
was NASA's tendency to establish two channels of supervision - one from 
headquarters, the other from the field center.)
<P>"NASA's supervisory job was difficult in that it could neither use the 'trust 
the contractor' approach (high reliability was too crucial to be left to the 
contractor alone) nor the 'tight control' approach (which would 'discourage 
contractor creativity and initiative') . . . . Therefore NASA had to follow a 
middle course, which combined contractor operating freedom with close NASA 
guidance. To achieve this balance it would be essential that there be a constant 
flow of information back and forth between NASA and the contractor. This flow 
could be promoted by periodic progress review meetings between NASA and the 
contractor, the placement of a NASA representative in the contractor's plant (to 
permit continuous face to face communication), and the use of a progress 
reporting system."
