<p>
This EPUB version of <i>This New Ocean</i> is based on the
<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4201/cover.htm">HTML version</a>
published by the NASA History Office.
Many small changes and improvements have been made:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of typos have been found and fixed by comparing the text
to an independent
<a href="http://archive.org/details/thisnewoceanhist00swen">scan
of the book</a> from the Internet Archive.</li>
<li>Missing illustrations have been added using high-resolution versions
published by NASA, the Internet Archive scans, and other sources.</li>
<li>Some illustrations have been replaced by alternatives, where they
were judged superior to those in the book.</li>
<li>Illustrations have been reorganized to better fit the EPUB
medium.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A complete list of changes and the tools used can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/foolip/thisnewocean">Git repository</a>.
