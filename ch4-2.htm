<H1>Missiles to Manned Ballistic Satellites</H1>The circumspect approach of NACA 
Headquarters to a national space program was only one of several being suggested 
formally in the winter of 1957-1958. Various other proposals came from the 
scientific community. In mid-October the American Rocket Society had called for 
a civilian space research and development agency. In November the National 
Academy of Sciences endorsed an idea for a National Space Establishment under 
civilian leadership. By April 1958 a total of 29 bills and resolutions relating 
to the organization of the Nation's space efforts would be introduced by members 
of the Congress. Almost everyone assumed that some sort of thorough-going reform 
legislation, probably creating an entirely new agency, was needed if the United 
States was to overcome the Soviet lead in space technology. On January 23, 1958, 
the Senate Preparedness Investigating Committee under Senator Lyndon B. Johnson 
had summarized its findings in 17 specific recommendations, including the 
establishment of an independent space agency.<A

During these months of debate and indecision, the military services continued 
their planning of space programs, both in hope of achieving a special role for 
themselves in space and in knowledge that U.S. planning could not simply stop 
during the months it took to settle the organizational problem.
<P>Of the three military services the Air Force moved most rapidly with plans 
for advanced projects and programs. Responding to a request sent by the Office 
of the Secretary of Defense to the three military services, Headquarters USAF by 
mid-January 1958 had completed its review of the comprehensive five-year 
astronautics program submitted the previous month by the Air Research and 
Development Command. On January 24 the Air Force submitted the plan to William 
M. Holaday, Director of Guided Missiles in the Department of Defense. The 
five-year outline envisaged the development of reconnaissance, communications, 
and weather satellites; recoverable data capsules; a "manned capsule test 
system"; then manned space stations; and an eventual manned base on the Moon. 
The Air Force estimated that funding requirements for beginning such a 
long-range program in fiscal year 1959 would total more than $1.7 billion.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source9"><SUP>9</A></SUP>
<P>The ambitious five-year plan, with its astronomical estimate of costs for the 
[78] coming fiscal year, had remained in Holaday's office. The Air Force pressed 
ahead with its astronautics plans, including the placing of a manned capsule in 
orbit. On January 29, 30, and 31, 1958, ARDC held a closed conference at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, where 11 aircraft and missile 
firms outlined for Air Force and NACA observers the various classified proposals 
for a manned satellite vehicle that they had submitted to ARDC during November 
and December 1957. The industry presentations appear to have varied considerably 
in thoroughness and complexity. The Northrop Corporation, for example, simply 
reviewed the boost-glide concept suggested by NACA at the Round Three Conference 
the previous October and already adopted by the Air Force for its Dyna-Soar 
project. By contrast, the Avco Manufacturing Corporation, the McDonnell Aircraft 
Corporation, Republic Aviation, and North American Aviation made detailed 
presentations, including estimates of the minimum amount of time required to put 
a man in orbit. Like Avco and other firms, McDonnell of St. Louis had been 
working on designs for a "minimum" satellite vehicle, employing a pure ballistic 
shape, since the spring of 1956, when the Air Force had first briefed industry 
representatives on its original Manned Ballistic Rocket Research proposal. 
Republic sketched a triangular planform arrangement modeled on the vehicle 
suggested the previous year by Antonio Ferri and others at the Gruen Applied 
Science Laboratories.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source10"><SUP>10</A></SUP> 
The "Ferri sled," as the Republic device was called, was one of two approaches 
wherein the pilot would parachute after being ejected from the spacecraft, the 
vehicle itself not being recovered. The other company advocating an expendable 
spacecraft was North American; an X-15, although designed to land conventionally 
on skids as a rocket research aircraft, would orbit and then impact minus its 
parachuting pilot.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source11"><SUP>11</A></SUP>
<P>After the Wright-Patterson conference, the Air Force stepped up the pace of 
its manned-satellite studies. On January 31, ARDC directed the Wright Air 
Development Center to focus on the quickest means of getting a man in orbit. The 
center was to receive advice from the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division in 
Los Angeles on selection of a booster system. A few weeks later the center 
issued a purchase request, valued at nearly $445,000, for a study of an internal 
ecological system that could sustain a man for 24 hours in an orbiting 
capsule.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source12"><SUP>12</A></SUP>
<P>On February 27, ARDC officers briefed General Curtis E. LeMay, Air Force Vice 
Chief of Staff, on three alternative approaches to manned orbital flight: 
developing an advanced version of the X-15 that could reach orbital velocity; 
speeding up the Dyna-Soar project, which eventually was supposed to put a 
hypersonic glider in orbit; or boosting a relatively simple, nonlifting 
ballistic capsule into orbit with an existing missile system, as proposed by 
Avco, McDonnell, and other companies. LeMay instructed ARDC to make a choice and 
submit a detailed plan for an Air Force man-in-space program as soon as 
possible.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source13"><SUP>13</A></SUP>
<P>While the Air Force pushed its manned satellite investigations and its 
development work on the Thor, Atlas, and Titan, the Army and the Navy initiated 
[79] manned space studies of their own in addition to accelerating their 
ballistic missile efforts with the Jupiter and the Polaris, respectively. 
Flushed with the success of the <I>Explorer I </I>satellite launching in 
January, the Army reached the apex of its astronautical prestige. Proud of the 
prowess of von Braun's rocket team at its Army Ballistic Missile Agency, 
Huntsville, Alabama, the Army sought a major role in military space technology. 
Since the Army already had lost operational responsibility for its Jupiter 
intermediate-range ballistic missile to the Air Force, a space mission was 
vitally important to its future in astronautics. Central to the Army's space 
plans was securing authorization, priority, and abundant financing from the 
Defense Department for one of von Braun's pet ideas, a clustered-engine booster 
vehicle with more than a million pounds of thrust.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source14"><SUP>14</A></SUP>
<P>On February 7, 1958, Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy, acting on 
President Eisenhower's instructions, ordered the creation of an Advanced 
Research Project Agency (ARPA) to manage all existing space projects. Roy W. 
Johnson, a vice-president of General Electric, took over the directorship of 
this new office; Director of Guided Missiles Holaday transferred some of his 
responsibilities to the agency.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source15"><SUP>15</A></SUP>
<P>Three weeks after the establishment of ARPA, Johnson acknowledged publicly 
that "the Air Force has a long term development responsibility for manned space 
flight capability with the primary objective of accomplishing satellite flight 
as soon as technology permits." The statement was reiterated on March 5 by a 
spokesman for McElroy. The Defense Department also authorized the Air Force to 
develop its "117L" system - an Atlas or Thor topped by a liquid-propellant upper 
stage (later named Agena) as a booster combination, together with an 
instrumented nose cone - "under the highest national priority in order to attain 
an initial operational capability at the earliest possible date." The 117L 
system, designed originally to orbit reconnaissance satellites, would now also 
be used for orbiting recoverable biological payloads, including primates.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source16"><SUP>16</A></SUP>
<P>In response to Vice Chief of Staff LeMay's instructions of February 27 and 
the apparent receptiveness of Defense Department officials to the Air Force's 
astronautical plans, the Air Research and Development Command moved to "firm up" 
its plans for manned space flight. On March 8, the Ballistic Missile Division 
proposed an 11-step program aimed at the ultimate objective of "Manned Space 
Flight to the Moon and Return." The steps included instrumented and 
animal-carrying orbital missions, a manned orbit of Earth, circumnavigation of 
the Moon with instruments and then animals, instrumented hard and soft landings 
on the Moon, an animal landing on the Moon, manned lunar circumnavigation, and a 
manned landing on the lunar surface. Then, on March 10, 11, and 12, ARDC staged 
a large conference at the offices of its Ballistic Missile Division in Los 
Angeles. On hand were more than 80 rocket, aircraft, and human-factors 
specialists from the Air Force, industry, and NACA. Although the space sights of 
the Ballistic Missile Division, under Major General Bernard A. Schriever, were 
set on the [80] distant "man on the Moon" goal, the basic objective of the Los 
Angeles man-in-space working conference was to hammer out an "abbreviated 
development plan" for getting a man in Earth orbit as quickly and as easily as 
possible.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source17"><SUP>17</A></SUP>
<P>The conference focused on what some Air Force speakers called a "quick and 
dirty" approach - orbital flight and recovery using a simple ballistic capsule 
and parachutes for a water landing in the vicinity of the Bahamas. The ballistic 
vehicle would weigh between 2,700 and 3,000 pounds, and would be about six feet 
in diameter and eight feet long. Its "life support," or internal ecological, 
system would be designed to sustain a man in orbit for as long as 48 hours. 
Because there was no real certainty that man could function under the various 
stresses of space flight, all systems in the capsule would be fully automatic.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source18"><SUP>18</A></SUP>
<P>The human passenger would be essentially a rider rather than a pilot, 
although for experimental purposes he would try to perform certain tasks. The 
body support arrangement - showing the influence of Harold J. von Beckh of 
ARDC's Aeromedical Field Laboratory - would have the spaceman supine on a couch 
that could be rotated according to the direction of the g forces building up 
during launch and reentry. The rotatable couch was regarded as necessary because 
the capsule would both exit and enter the atmosphere front-end forward. Maximum 
reentry loads on the occupant of the Air Force machine were expected to be about 
9 g; the interior temperature during reentry was not supposed to exceed 150 
degrees. An ablative nose cone would provide thermal protection. Small 
retrograde rockets would brake the vehicle enough to allow the pull of gravity 
to effect a reentry.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source19"><SUP>19</A></SUP>
<P>Among the most fervent Air Force champions of a man-in-space project at the 
Los Angeles conference were the human-factors experts, some of whom had been 
studying the medical problems of upper- and extra-atmospheric flight for more 
than a decade. But predictably they were also the most cautious people in 
assessing the psychophysiological limits of human tolerance under the conditions 
of flight into space. Air Force medical personnel generally agreed that 15 or 
more launches of primates and smaller biological payloads should precede the 
first manned orbital shot. Colonel John P. Stapp of the Aeromedical Field 
Laboratory felt that the first human space passengers should have both 
engineering and medical training, that they should go through at least six 
months of selection, testing, and preparation, and that from a medical 
standpoint a television camera was an essential piece of equipment in the manned 
capsule. Major David G. Simons, Stapp's colleague, believed that continuous 
medical monitoring of the man, including voice contact throughout the orbital 
mission, should be mandatory.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source20"><SUP>20</A></SUP>
<P>The Air Force flight physicians knew that German centrifuge experiments 
during the Second World War had proved that men could withstand as much as 17 g 
for as long as 2 minutes without losing consciousness.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source21"><SUP>21</A></SUP> 
Nevertheless, numerous centrifuge runs at Wright-Patterson and at Johnsville, 
Pennsylvania, and calculations of the angle of entry from an orbital altitude of 
about 170 miles had convinced them that a 12-g maximum was a good ground rule 
for designing the capsule body-support system. With a continuously accelerating 
single-stage [81] booster following a steep launch trajectory, an aborted flight 
and subsequent reentry might subject the rider to as much as 20 g. Consequently 
the Air Force specialists assumed that a two-stage launch rocket would be 
necessary to provide a shallower reentry path and lower forces.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source22"><SUP>22</A></SUP>
<P>In retrospect, there were two striking aspects of the Los Angeles 
man-in-space presentation. The first was that the Air Force, historically 
devoted to piloted, fully controllable aircraft, was thinking in terms of a 
completely automatic orbital capsule, virtually without aerodynamic controls, 
whose passenger would do little more than observe and carry out physiological 
exercises. The other was that no attention was given to using the Atlas, alone 
as a booster system for a manned satellite. Indeed hardly anyone advocated 
putting an upper stage on the Atlas to constitute the desired two-stage launch 
vehicle. Spokesmen for Space Technology Laboratories, technical overseer of the 
Air Force ballistic missile program, went so far as to declare that a more 
dependable booster than the Atlas would have to be developed. They favored 
adapting the intermediate-range Thor and combining it with a second stage 
powered by a new fluorine-hydrazine engine developing some 15,000 pounds of 
thrust. By the time the conference adjourned on March 12, the conferees were in 
fairly general agreement that about 30 Thors and 20 fluorine-hydrazine 
second-stage rockets would be needed for a manned satellite project. Some 8 to 
12 Vanguard second stages would also be needed, to be mated with Thors for 
orbiting smaller, animal-bearing capsules.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source23"><SUP>23</A></SUP>
<P>While the "abbreviated development plan" was emerging from the Los Angeles 
gathering, a NACA steering committee met at the Ames laboratory. Its members 
were Hartley A. Soulé and John V. Becker of Langley, Alfred J. Eggers of Ames, 
and Walter C. Williams of the High Speed Flight Station. They had been appointed 
by NACA Assistant Director Ira H. Abbott to suggest a course of action on the 
January 31 proposal by Lieutenant General Donald L. Putt, Air Force Deputy Chief 
of Staff, Development, to NACA Director Dryden for formal NACA-Air Force 
cooperation in a manned satellite venture.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source24"><SUP>24</A></SUP> 
The steering committee agreed that the zero-lift approach - the ballistic 
capsule - offered the best promise for an early orbital mission. Soulé, Becker, 
Eggers, and Williams recommended that "NACA accept the Air Force invitation to 
participate in a joint development of a manned orbital vehicle on an expedited 
basis," and that "the ballistic type of vehicle should be developed."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-2.htm#source25"><SUP>25</A></SUP>
<P>On March 14, a month and a half after Putt's letter to Dryden, NACA 
officially informed Headquarters USAF that it would cooperate in drawing up a 
detailed manned satellite development plan. On April 11, Dryden sent to General 
Thomas D. White, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, a proposed memorandum of 
understanding declaring an intention to set up a "joint project for a 
recoverable manned satellite test vehicle." Before a final agreement was 
actually signed, however, NACA Assistant Director for Research Management 
Clotaire Wood, at Dryden's direction, suggested to Colonel Donald H. Heaton of 
Headquarters USAF that the NACA-Air Force arrangement "should be put aside for 
the time [82] being." Heaton agreed, and in mid-May the joint Air Force-NACA 
manned space undertaking was tabled indefinitely.<A
