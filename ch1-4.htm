<H1>Postwar American Rocketry</H1>Meanwhile the United States, convinced of the 
long-term superiority of her intercontinental bombers, pursued national security 
by means of airpower. The extremely heavy weight of atomic warheads meant that 
they would have to be delivered by large bombers, or by a much bigger rocket 
than anyone in the military was willing to ask Congress to fund. Despite the 
early postwar warnings of General Henry H. Arnold and others, for whom the V-2 
experience was prophetic, [19] the Truman administration and Congress listened 
to conservative military men and civilian scientists who felt that until at 
least 1965 manned bombers, supplemented by air-breathing guided missiles 
evolving from the German V-1, should be the principal American "deterrent 
force."<A

Just after the war former NACA Chairman Bush, then Director of the Office of 
Scientific Research and Development, had expressed the prevailing mood in a 
much-quoted (and perhaps much-regretted) piece of testimony before a 
Congressional committee: "There has been a great deal said about a 3,000-mile 
high-angle rocket. In my opinion, such a thing is impossible today and will be 
impossible for many years .... I wish the American public would leave that out 
of their thinking."<A

<P>The United States developed guided missiles for air-to-air, air-to-surface, 
and surface-to-air interception uses and as tactical surface-to-surface weapons. 
Rocket motors, using both liquid and solid fuels, gradually replaced jet 
propulsion systems, but short-range defensive missiles remained advanced enough 
for most tastes until the late 1950s.<A

<P>As for scientific research in the upper atmosphere, the backlog of V-2s put 
together by the United States Army from captured components would do in the 
early postwar years. From April 1946 to October 1951, 66 V-2s were fired at the 
Army's White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico, in the most extensive rocket and 
upper-atmospheric research program to that time. The Army Ordnance Department, 
the Air Force, the Air Force Cambridge Research Center, the General Electric 
Company, various scientific institutions, universities, and government agencies, 
and the Naval Research Laboratory participated in the White Sands V-2 program. 
Virtually all the rockets were heavily instrumented, and many of them carried 
plant life and animals. V-2s carried monkeys aloft on four occasions; telemetry 
data transmitted from the rockets showed no ill effects on the primates until 
each was killed in the crash. The most memorable launching at White Sands, 
however, came on February 24, 1949, when a V-2 boosted a WAC Corporal rocket 
developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 244 miles into space and to a speed 
of 5,510 miles per hour, the greatest altitude and velocity yet attained by a 
man-made object. A year and a half later, a V-2 - WAC Corporal combination rose 
from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the first launch at the Air Force's newly 
activated Long Range Proving Ground.<A

<P>By the late forties, with the supply of V-2s rapidly disappearing, work had 
begun on more reliable and efficient research rockets. The most durable of these 
indigenous projectiles proved to be the Aerobee, designed as a sounding rocket 
by the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University and financed by 
the Office of Naval Research. With a peak altitude of about 80 miles, the 
Aerobee served as a reliable tool for upper-atmospheric research until the late 
1950s.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-4.htm#source56"><SUP>56</SUP></A> 
The Naval Research Laboratory designed the Viking, a long, slim high-altitude 
sounding rocket, manufactured by the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore. In 
August 1951 the Viking bettered its own altitude record for a single-stage 
rocket, reaching 136 miles from a White Sands launch. In the fifties, 
instrumentation [20] carried in Aerobees and Vikings extended knowledge of the 
atmosphere to 150 miles, provided photographs of Earth's curvature and cloud 
cover, and gave some information on the Sun and cosmic radiation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-4.htm#source57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
<P>In 1955 the Viking was chosen as the first stage and an improved Aerobee as 
the second stage for a new, three-stage rocket to be used in Project Vanguard, 
which was to orbit an instrumented research satellite as part of the American 
contribution to the International Geophysical Year. The decision to use the 
Viking and the "Aerobee-Hi" in this country's first effort to launch an unmanned 
scientific satellite illustrates the basic dichotomy in thought and practice 
governing postwar rocket development in the United States: After the expenditure 
of the V-2s, scientific activity should employ relatively inexpensive sounding 
rockets with small thrusts. Larger, higher-thrust, and more expensive rockets to 
be used as space launchers must await a specific military requirement. Such a 
policy meant that the Soviet Union, early fostering the ballistic missile as an 
intercontinental delivery system, might have a proven long-range rocket before 
the United States; the Soviets might also, if they chose, launch larger 
satellites sooner than this country.
<P>By 1951, three sizable military rockets were under development in the United 
[21] States. One, an Air Force project for an intercontinental ramjet-booster 
rocket combination called the Navaho, took many twists and turns before ending 
in mid-1957. After 11 years and $680 million, the Air Force, lacking funds for 
further development, canceled the Navaho enterprise. Technologically, however, 
Navaho proved a worthwhile investment; its booster-engine configuration, for 
example, became the basic design later used in various rockets.<A

The two other rocket projects being financed by the military in the early 
fifties were ultimately successful, both as weapons systems and as space 
boosters.

term that simply meant any pilotless flying craft) designed and developed by the 
Navy and the Air Force in the first decade after the war were the Gorgon, 
Plover, Regulus, Cobra, Bomarc, Snark, Matador, and Loon, the last being a Navy 
version of the German V-1. Of these weapons only the Snark was a genuinely 
long-range, or intercontinental, missile, and it was subsonic and thus 
vulnerable to radar-controlled antiaircraft rockets. See Ordway and Wakeford,
