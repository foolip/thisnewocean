<H1>Flight of <I>Aurora 7</I></H1>At 1:15 a.m., May 24, 1962, Scott Carpenter 
was awakened in his quarters in Hangar S at Cape Canaveral. He ate a breakfast 
of filet mignon, poached eggs, strained orange juice, toast, and coffee, 
prepared by his dietitian. During the next hour, starting about 2:15 a.m., he 
had a physical examination and stood patiently in his underwear as the sensors 
were attached at various spots on his lean body, and by 3:25 he had donned his 
silver suit and had it checked. Everything had gone so smoothly that Carpenter 
had time to relax in a contour chair while waiting to board the van.
<P>[447] At 3:45, Carpenter and his retinue, including Joe Schmitt and John 
Glenn, marched from the hangar and climbed aboard the vehicle for a slow ride to 
Pad 14, where <I>Aurora 7</I> sat atop the Atlas. Again there was a pause, 
during which a Weather Bureau representative presented a briefing to the 
astronaut-of-the-day, predicting a dispersal of the ground fog then hovering 
around the launch site. Finally, at 4:35, Carpenter received word from Mercury 
Control to ascend the gantry. Just before he boarded the elevator he stopped to 
swap greetings with and to thank the flight support crewmen. After the final 
checks in the gantry white room, the astronaut crawled into the capsule and got 
settled with only minor difficulties, and soon the capsule crew was bolting the 
hatch. This time all 70 bolts were aligned properly.<A

<P>Meanwhile the booster countdown was racing along. Christopher Kraft recalled 
that the countdown was "as near perfect as could be hoped for." The only thing 
complicating the prelaunch sequence was the persistent ground fog and broken 
cloudiness at dawn. Strapped in the contour couch, and finding the new couch 
liner comfortable, Carpenter was busy verifying his preflight checklist. Just 11 
minutes before the scheduled launch time, the operations team decided that 
adequate camera coverage was not yet possible, and three consecutive 15-minute 
holds were called. Although Carpenter felt that he could continue in a hold 
status indefinitely, he was thirsty and drank some cold tea from his squeeze 
bottle supply. During the holds he talked with his wife Rene and their four 
children at the Cape, assuring them that all was well.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source77"><SUP>77</SUP></A>
<P>The rising sun rapidly dispelled the ground fog. Then at 7:45 a.m., after the 
smoothest countdown of an American manned space mission to date, Mercury-Atlas 
7, bearing <I>Aurora 7</I>, rose majestically off the pad while some 40 million 
people watched by television.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source78"><SUP>78</SUP></A>
<P>Kraft, the flight director, described the powered phase of the flight as so 
"excellent" that the decision to "go-for-mission" was almost routine. 
Seventy-three seconds from launch, the booster's radio inertial guidance system 
locked on and directed the flight from staging until T plus 5:38 minutes. 
Actually this amounted to some 28 seconds after the Atlas sustainer engine had 
died, but no guidance inputs were possible after engine shutdown. Carpenter 
tried using the parabolic mirror on his chest to watch the booster's 
programming, but he could see only a reflection of the pitch attitude. At about 
35,000 feet he noticed out his window a contrail, and then an airplane producing 
another contrail. The sky began to darken; it was not yet black, but it was no 
longer a light blue.
<P>The booster performed much more quietly than Carpenter had expected from all 
its awesome power. Vibration had been slight at liftoff. Booster engine cutoff 
was smooth and gentle, but a few seconds later the noise accompanying maximum 
aerodynamic stress began to build up. A wisp of smoke that appeared out the 
window gave Carpenter the impression that the escape tower had jettisoned, but a 
glance showed that it was still there. Shortly thereafter, when the tower did 
separate from the capsule, Carpenter "felt a bigger jolt than at staging." [448] 
He watched the tower cartwheel lazily toward the horizon, smoke trailing from 
its three rocket nozzles.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source79"><SUP>79</SUP></A>
<P>Sustainer engine cutoff came only as a gentle drop in acceleration. Two bangs 
were cues that the clamp-ring explosive bolts had fired and that the posigrade 
rockets had propelled the spacecraft clear of the booster. Now <I>Aurora 7</I> 
was on its own and in space. Becoming immediately aware that he was weightless, 
Carpenter elatedly reported that zero g was pleasant. Just as the capsule and 
booster separated, the astronaut had noticed that the capillary tube in his 
liquid-test apparatus seemed to fill. Then he averted his gaze; it was time to 
turn the spacecraft around to its normal backward flying orbital attitude. Since 
Glenn had left this maneuver to the automatic control system and the cost in 
fuel had been high, Carpenter used fly-by-wire. The spacecraft came smartly 
around at an expense of only 1.6 pounds of fuel, compared with over 5 pounds 
used on Glenn's MA-6 maneuver.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source80"><SUP>80</SUP></A>
<P>As the capsule swung around from antenna-canister-forward to 
heatshield-forward, Carpenter was impressed by the fact that he felt absolutely 
no angular motion; his instruments provided the only evidence that the 
turnaround maneuver was being executed. Like Glenn, he was amazed that he felt 
no sensation of speed, although he knew he was traveling at orbital velocity 
(actually 17,549 miles per hour). Soon he had his first awe-inspiring view of 
the horizon - "an arresting sight," as he described it. Quickly checking his 
control systems, he found everything in order. Unknown to him, however, the 
horizon scanner optically sensing his spacecraft's pitch attitude was off by 
about 20 degrees. It was some time before he deduced this system was in error.
<P>As Glenn had done, Carpenter peered out the window to track the spent Atlas 
sustainer engine. The tankage appeared to fall downward, as the engineers had 
predicted, and was tumbling away slowly. A trail of ice crystals two or three 
times longer than the launch vehicle streamed from its nozzle. Over the Canary 
Islands, Carpenter still could see the sustainer tagging along below the 
spacecraft. Meanwhile the astronaut continued to check the capsule systems and 
report his findings to the tracking sites. Over Kano, in mid-Nigeria, he said 
that he was getting behind in his flight plan because of difficulty in loading 
his camera with the special film to photograph the Earth-horizon limb. Before he 
moved beyond radio range of Kano, however, he managed to snap a few photographs. 
Although it was now almost dusk on his first "45-minute day," Carpenter was 
becoming increasingly warm and began adjusting his suit-temperature knob.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source81"><SUP>81</SUP></A>
<P>Over the Indian Ocean on his first pass, Carpenter glanced down for a view 
through the periscope, which he found to be quite ineffective on the dark side 
of Earth. Concluding that the periscope seemed to be useless at night, he 
returned to the window for visual references. Even when the gyros were caged and 
he was not exactly sure of his attitude position, he felt absolutely no 
sensation of disorientation; it was a simple matter in the daylight to roll the 
spacecraft over and watch for a landmark to pop into view. Carpenter mentioned 
many recognizable landmarks, [449] such as Lake Chad, Africa, the rain forests 
of that continent, and Madagascar. But he was a little surprised to find out 
that most of Earth when seen from orbit is covered by clouds the greater part of 
the time.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source82"><SUP>82</SUP></A>
<P>While over the Indian Ocean, Carpenter discovered that his celestial 
observations were hampered by glare from light seepage around the satellite 
clock inside the capsule. The light from the rim of the clock, which should 
presumably have been screened, made it hard for him to adjust his eyes to night 
vision. To Slayton at the Muchea station, Carpenter reported that he could see 
no more stars from his vantage point in space than he could have seen on Earth. 
Also he said that the stars were not particularly useful in gaining heading 
information.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source83"><SUP>83</SUP></A>
<P>Like his orbital predecessor, Carpenter failed to see the star- shell flares 
fired in an observation experiment. This time the flares shot up from the Great 
Victoria Desert near Woomera, Australia, rather than from the Indian Ocean ship. 
According to the plan, four flares of one-million candlepower were to be 
launched for Carpenter's benefit on his first orbit, and three more each on his 
second and third passes. On the first try the flares, each having a burning time 
of 1&frac12; minutes, were ignited at 60-second intervals. At this time most of the 
Woomera area was covered by clouds that hid the illumination of the flares; the 
astronaut consequently saw nothing and the experiment was discontinued on the 
succeeding two passes, as weather conditions did not improve.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source84"><SUP>84</SUP></A>
<P>Out over the Pacific on its first circuit, <I>Aurora 7</I> performed nicely. 
The Canton Island station received the telemetered body temperature reading of 
102 degrees and asked Carpenter if he was uncomfortable at that temperature. 
"No, I don't believe that's correct," Carpenter replied. "I can't imagine I'm 
that hot. I'm quite comfortable, but sweating some." The medical monitors 
accepted Carpenter's self-assessment and concluded that the feverish temperature 
reading resulted from an error in the equipment. For the rest of the journey, 
however, the elevated temperatures persisted, causing the various communicators 
to ask frequently about Carpenter's physical status.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source85"><SUP>85</SUP></A>
<P>The food Carpenter carried on his voyage was different from Glenn's which was 
of the squeeze-tube, baby-food variety. For Carpenter the Pillsbury Company had 
prepared three kinds of snacks, composed of chocolate, figs, and dates with 
high-protein cereals; and the Nestlé Company had provided some "bonbons," 
composed of orange peel with almonds, high-protein cereals with almonds, and 
cereals with raisins. These foods were processed into particles about 
three-fourths of an inch square. Coated with an edible glaze, each piece was 
packaged separately and stored in an opaque plastic bag. As he passed over 
Canton he reported that he had eaten one bite of the inflight food, which was 
crumbling badly. Weightless crumbs drifting around in the cabin were not only 
bothersome but also potentially dangerous to his breathing. Though he had been 
able to eat one piece, his gloved hands made it awkward to get the food to his 
mouth around the helmet microphones.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source86"><SUP>86</SUP></A> 
Once in his mouth, however, the food was tasty enough and easy enough to eat.
<P>[450] During the second orbit, as he had on the first, Carpenter made 
frequent capsule maneuvers with the fly-by-wire and manual-proportional modes of 
attitude control. He slewed his ship around to make photographs; he pitched the 
capsule down 80 degrees in case the ground flares were fired over Woomera; he 
yawed around to observe and photograph the airglow phenomenon; and he rolled the 
capsule until Earth was "up" for the inverted flight experiment. Carpenter even 
stood the capsule on its antenna canister and found that the view was 
exhilarating. Although the manual control system worked well, the MA-7 pilot had 
some difficulty caging the attitude gyros to zero before inverting the 
spacecraft. On two occasions he had to recycle the caging operation after the 
gyros tumbled beyond their responsive limits.
<P>Working under his crowded experiment schedule and the heavy manual maneuver 
program, on six occasions Carpenter accidentally actuated the 
sensitive-to-the-touch, high-thrust attitude control jets, which brought about 
"double authority control," or the redundant operation of both the automatic and 
the manual systems. So by the end of the first two orbits Carpenter's control 
fuel supply had dipped to about 42 percent in the manual tanks and 45 percent in 
the automatic tanks. During his second orbit, ground capsule communicators at 
various tracking sites repeatedly reminded him to conserve his fuel.
<P>Although his fuel usage was high during the second circumnavigation, 
Carpenter still managed to continue the experiments. Just as he passed over the 
Cape, for example, an hour and 38 minutes from launch, Carpenter deployed the 
multicolored balloon. For a few seconds he saw the confetti spray, signaling 
deployment. Then, as the line lazily played out, he realized that the balloon 
had not inflated properly; only two of the five colors - orange and dull 
aluminum - were visible, the orange clearly the more brilliant. Two small, 
earlike appendages about six to eight inches each, described as "sausages," 
emerged on the sides of the partially inflated sphere. The movement of the 
half-inflated balloon was erratic and unpredictable, but Carpenter managed to 
obtain a few drag resistance measurements. A little more than a half hour after 
the balloon was launched, Carpenter began some spacecraft maneuvers and the 
tether line twined to some extent about the capsule's antenna canister. 
Carpenter wanted to get rid of the balloon and attempted to release it going 
into the third orbit over the Cape, but the partially successful experimental 
device stayed doggedly near the spacecraft.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source87"><SUP>87</SUP></A>
<P>As Carpenter entered the last orbit, both his automatic and manual control 
fuel tanks were less than half full. So <I>Aurora 7</I> began a long period of 
drifting flight. Short recess periods to conserve fuel had occurred earlier in 
the flight, but now Carpenter and his ship were to drift in orbit almost around 
the world. Although his rapidly depleting fuel supply had made the drift a 
necessity, this vehicle control relaxation maneuver, if successful, would be a 
valuable engineering experiment. The results would be most useful in planning 
the rest and sleep periods for an astronaut on a longer Mercury mission. 
Carpenter enjoyed his floating orbit, observing that it was a simple matter to 
start a roll rate of [452] perhaps one degree per second and let the capsule 
slowly revolve as long as desired. <I>Aurora 7</I> drifted gracefully through 
space for more than an hour, or almost until retrofire time.
<P>While in his drifting flight, Carpenter used the Moon to check his capsule's 
attitude. John Glenn had reported some difficulty in obtaining and holding an 
absolute zero-degree heading. Carpenter, noting that the Moon appeared almost in 
the center of his window, oriented the spacecraft so that it held the Moon on 
the exact center mark and maintained the position with ease.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source88"><SUP>88</SUP></A>
<P>During the third orbital pass, Carpenter caught on film the phenomenon of the 
flattened Sun at sunset. John O'Keefe and his fellow scientists at Goddard had 
taught Carpenter that the color layers at sunset might provide information on 
light transfusion characteristics of the upper atmosphere. Carpenter furnished a 
vivid description of the sunset to the capsule communicator on the Indian Ocean 
ship: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The sunsets are most spectacular. The earth is black after the sun 
  has set. . . . The first band close to the earth is red, the next is yellow, 
  the next is blue, the next is green, and the next is sort of a - sort of a 
  purple. It's almost like a very brilliant rainbow. These layers extend from at 
  least 90 degrees either side of the sun at sunset. This bright horizon band 
  extended at least 90 degrees north and south of the position at 
sunset.</BLOCKQUOTE>He took some 19 pictures of the flattened Sun.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source89"><SUP>89</SUP></A>
<P>As Carpenter drifted over oceans and land masses, he observed and reported on 
the haze layer, or airglow phenomenon, about which Glenn had marveled. 
Carpenter's brief moments of airglow study during the second orbit failed to 
match the expectations he had derived from Glenn's reports and the Goddard 
scientists' predictions on the phenomenon. Having more leisure on his third 
circuit, Carpenter described the airglow layer in detail to Slayton at the 
Muchea tracking site: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . . the haze layer is very bright. I would say about 8 to 10 
  degrees above the real horizon. And I would say that the haze layer is about 
  twice as high above the horizon as the bright blue band at sunset is; it's 
  twice as thick. A star - stars are occluded as we pass through this haze 
  layer. I have a good set of stars to watch going through at this time. I'll 
  try to get some photometer readings. . . . It is not twice as thick. It's 
  thinner, but it is located at a distance about twice as far away as the top of 
  the band at sunset. It's very narrow, and as bright as the horizon of the 
  earth itself.</BLOCKQUOTE>The single star, not stars, that Carpenter tracked was 
Phecda Ursae Majoris, in the Big Dipper or Great Bear constellation, with a 
magnitude of 2.5.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source90"><SUP>90</SUP></A>
<P>With each sunrise, Carpenter also saw the "fireflies," or "Glenn effect," as 
the Russians were calling it. To him the particles looked more like snowflakes 
than fireflies, and they did not seem to be truly luminous, as Glenn had said. 
The particles varied in size, brightness, and color. Some were gray, some were 
white, and one in particular, said Carpenter, looked like a helical shaving from 
a lathe. Although they seemed to travel at different speeds, they did not move 
out and away [453] from the spacecraft as the confetti had in the balloon 
experiment.
<P>At dawn on the third pass Carpenter reached for a device known as a 
densitometer, that measured light intensity. Accidentally his gloved hand bumped 
against the capsule hatch, and suddenly a cloud of particles flew past the 
window. He yawed right to investigate, noting that the particles traveled across 
the front of the window from right to left. Another tap of the hand on the hatch 
sent off a second shower; a tap on the wall produced another. Since the exterior 
of the spacecraft evidently was covered with frost, Glenn's "fireflies" became 
Carpenter's "frostflies."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source91"><SUP>91</SUP></A>
<P>Until <I>Aurora 7</I> reached the communication range of the Hawaiian station 
on the third pass, Christopher Kraft, directing the flight from the Florida 
control center, considered this mission the most successful to date; everything 
had gone perfectly except for some overexpenditure of hydrogen peroxide fuel. 
Carpenter had exercised his manual controls with ease in a number of spacecraft 
maneuvers and had made numerous and valuable observations in the interest of 
space science. Even though the control fuel usage had been excessive in the 
first two orbits, by the time he drifted near Hawaii on the third pass Carpenter 
had successfully maintained more than 40 percent of his fuel in both the 
automatic and the manual tanks. According to the mission rules, this ought to be 
quite enough hydrogen peroxide, reckoned Kraft, to thrust the capsule into the 
retrofire attitude, hold it, and then to reenter the atmosphere using either the 
automatic or the manual control system.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source92"><SUP>92</SUP></A>
<P>The tracking site at Hawaii instructed Carpenter to start his preretrofire 
countdown and to shift from manual control to the automatic stabilization and 
control system. He explained to the ground station over which he was passing at 
five miles per second that he had gotten somewhat behind on the preretro 
checkoff list while verifying his hypothesis about the snowflake-like particles 
outside his window. Then as Carpenter began aligning the spacecraft and shifting 
control to the automatic mode, he suddenly found himself to be in trouble. The 
automatic stabilization system would not hold the 34- degree pitch and 
zero-degree yaw attitude. As he tried to determine what was wrong, he fell 
behind in his check of other items. When he hurriedly switched to the 
fly-by-wire control mode, he forgot to switch off the manual system. For about 
10 minutes fuel from both systems was being used redundantly.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source93"><SUP>93</SUP></A>
<P>Finally, Carpenter felt that he had managed to align the spacecraft for the 
retrofire sequence. The Hawaiian communicator urged him to complete as much of 
the checklist as possible before he passed out of that site's communications 
range. Now Alan Shepard's voice from the Arguello, California, station came in 
loud and clear, asking whether the <I>Aurora 7</I> pilot had bypassed the 
automatic retroattitude switch. Carpenter quickly acted on this timely reminder. 
Then the countdown for retrofire began. Because the automatic system was 
misbehaving, Carpenter was to push the button to ignite the solid-fuel 
retrorockets strapped to the heatshield. About three seconds after Shepard's 
call of "Mark! Fire One," the first [454] rocket ignited and blew. Then the 
second and the third followed in reassuring succession. Carpenter saw wisps of 
smoke inside his cabin as the rockets braked him out of orbit.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source94"><SUP>94</SUP></A>
<P>Carpenter's attitude error was more than he estimated when he reported his 
attitude nearly correct. Actually <I>Aurora 7</I> was canted at retrofire about 
25 degrees to the right, and thus the reverse thrust vector was not in line with 
the flight path vector. This misalignment alone would have caused the spacecraft 
to overshoot the planned impact point by about 175 miles. But the retrorockets 
began firing three seconds late, adding another 15 miles or so to the trajectory 
error. Later analyses also revealed a thrust decrement in the retrorockets that 
was about three percent below nominal, contributing 60 more miles to the 
overshoot. If Carpenter had not bypassed the automatic retroattitude switch and 
manually ignited the retrorockets he could have overshot his pickup point in the 
Atlantic by an even greater distance.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source95"><SUP>95</SUP></A>
<P>Unlike Glenn, Carpenter had no illusion that he was being driven back to 
Hawaii at retrofire. Instead he had the feeling that <I>Aurora 7</I> had simply 
stopped and that if he looked toward Earth he would see it coming straight up. 
One glance out the window, however, and the "impression was washed away."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source96"><SUP>96</SUP></A> 
The completion of retrofire produced no changes the pilot could feel until his 
reentry began in earnest about 10 minutes later.
<P>After the retrorockets had fired, Carpenter realized that the manual control 
system was still on. Quickly he turned off the fly-by-wire system, intending to 
check the manual controls.Although the manual fuel gauge read six percent left, 
there was, in fact, no fuel and consequently no manual control. So Carpenter 
switched back to fly-by-wire. At that time the automatic system supply read 15 
percent, but the astronaut wondered how much really remained. Could it be only 
about 10 percent? With this gnawing doubt and realizing that it was still 10 
minutes before .05-g time, Carpenter kept hands strictly off for most of his 
drifting glide. Whatever fuel there was left must be saved for the critical 
tumble. This 10-minute interval seemed like eternity to the pilot. The attitude 
indicators appeared to be useless, and there was little fuel to control attitude 
anyway. The only thing he trusted for reference was the view out of the window; 
using fly-by-wire sparingly he tried to keep the horizon in view. Although 
concerned about the fuel conservation problem, Carpenter gained some momentary 
relief from the fascinating vistas below: "I can make out very, very small - 
farm land, pasture land below. I see individual fields, rivers, lakes, roads, I 
think. I'll get back to reentry attitude."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source97"><SUP>97</SUP></A>
<P>Finally, <I>Aurora 7</I> reached the .05-g acceleration point about 500 miles 
off the coast of Florida. As he began to feel his weight once again, Carpenter 
noted that the automatic fuel needle still read 15 percent. Within seconds the 
capsule began to oscillate badly. A quick switch to the auxiliary damping mode 
steadied the spacecraft. Grissom, the Cape communicator, reminded him to close 
his faceplate.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source98"><SUP>98</SUP></A>
<P>[455] <I>Aurora 7</I> was now in the midst of its blazing return to Earth. 
Carpenter heard the hissing sounds reported by Glenn, the cues that his ship was 
running into aerodynamic resistance. Immediately the capsule began to roll 
slowly, as programmed, to minimize the landing point dispersion. Carpenter 
looked out the window for the bright orange glow, the "fireball," as Glenn had 
described it, but there was only a moderate increase in light intensity. Rather 
than an orange glow, Carpenter saw a light-green glow apparently surrounding the 
cylindrical section. Was this radiant portion of the spacecraft ablating? Was 
the trim angle correct? The evenness of the oscillations argued to Carpenter 
that the trim angle was good. All the way through this zone Carpenter kept 
talking. Gradually it became difficult to squeeze the words out; the heaviest 
deceleration load was coming. The peak g period lasted longer than he had 
expected, and it took forceful breath control to utter anything.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source99"><SUP>99</SUP></A>
<P>The automatic fuel tank on <I>Aurora 7</I> was emptied between 80,000 and 
70,000 feet. As the plasma sheath of ionized air enveloped his spacecraft, 
communication efforts with Carpenter became useless, but the telemetered signals 
received by the radar stations at the Cape and on San Salvador predicted a 
successful reentry. The oscillations were increasing as the capsule approached 
the 50,000-foot level. <I>Aurora 7</I> was swinging beyond the 10-degree 
"tolerable" limits. Carpenter strained upward to arm the drogue at 45,000 feet, 
but he forced himself to ride out still more severe oscillations before he fired 
the drogue parachute mortar at 25,000 feet. The chute pulsed out and vibrated 
like thin, quivering sheets of metal. At 15,000 feet Carpenter armed the main 
parachute switch, and at 9,500 feet he deployed the chute manually. The fabric 
quivered, but the giant umbrella streamed, reefed, and unfurled as it should. 
The rate of descent was 30 feet per second, the exact design specification. The 
spacecraft landing bag deploy was on automatic. Carpenter listened for the 
"clunk," heard the heatshield fall into position, and waited to hit the water. 
<I>Aurora 7</I> seemed to be ready for the landing, and the recovery forces knew 
within a few miles the location of the spacecraft as radar tracking after 
retrofire had given and confirmed the landing point.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source100"><SUP>100</SUP></A>
<P>Splashdown was noisy but less of a jolt than the spaceman had expected. The 
capsule, however, did not right itself within a minute as it was supposed to do. 
Carpenter, noticing some drops of water on his tape recorder, wondered if 
<I>Aurora 7</I> was about to meet the fate of <I>Liberty Bell 7</I>, and then 
sighed in relief when he could find no evidence of a leak. He waited a little 
longer for the spacecraft to straighten up, but it continued to list to his 
left. Grissom's last transmission from Mercury Control had told Carpenter that 
it would take the pararescue men about an hour to reach him, and the astronaut 
realized that he had evidently overshot the planned landing zone. When he failed 
to raise a response on his radio, he decided to get out of the cramped capsule. 
Then he saw that the capsule was floating rather deeply, which meant that it 
might be dangerous to remove the hatch. Sweating profusely in the 101-degree 
temperature of the cabin, he pulled off his helmet and began the job of egress 
as it had been originally planned. [456] Carpenter wormed his way upward through 
the throat of the spacecraft, a hard, hot job made bearable by his leaving the 
suit circuit hose attached and not unrolling the neck dam. He struggled with the 
camera, packaged life raft, survival kit, and kinky hose before he finally got 
his head outside.
<P>Half out of the top hatch, Carpenter rested on his elbows momentarily, 
released the suit hose but failed to deploy the neck dam and lock the hose 
inlet, and surveyed the sea. Lazy swells, some as high as six feet, did not look 
too forbidding. So he carefully laid his hand camera on top of the recovery 
compartment, squeezed out of the top, and carefully lowered himself into the 
water, tipping the listing spacecraft slightly in the process. Holding onto the 
capsule, he was able to easily inflate the life raft - upside down. By this 
time, feeling some water in his boots, he secured the hose inlet to the suit. He 
then held on to the spacecraft's side and managed to flip the raft upright. 
After crawling onto the yellow raft, he retrieved the camera, unrolled the suit 
neck dam, and prepared to wait for as long as it took the recovery searchers to 
find him. The recovery beacon was operating and the green dye pervaded the sea 
all around him.<A

<P>The status of Carpenter and <I>Aurora 7</I> was unknown to the public. 
Everyone following the flight by radio or television knew that the spacecraft 
must be down. But was the pilot safe? What the public did not know was that one 
P2V airplane had received the spacecraft's beacon signal from a distance of only 
50 miles, while another plane had picked up the signal from 250 miles. <I>Aurora 
7</I>'s position was well known to the recovery forces in the area. About eight 
minutes before the spacecraft landed, an SA-16 seaplane of the Air Force Air 
Rescue Service had taken off from Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, for the 
radar-predicted landing point. Three ships - a Coast Guard cutter at St. Thomas 
Island, a merchantman 31 miles from the plotted point, and the destroyer 
<I>Farragut</I> about 75 miles away to the southwest - were in the vicinity of 
the impact point. But it would certainly take longer than an hour for any 
recovery unit to reach the site. Since Carpenter's raft had no radio, the drama 
was heightened. What exactly had happened to Carpenter after his landing was 
known only to the astronaut and perhaps to a few sea gulls and sea bass.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source102"><SUP>102</SUP></A>
<P>Carpenter settled down on his raft and waited patiently for his rescuers. He 
mused over some seaweed floating nearby and "a black fish that was just as 
friendly as he could be - right down by the raft." In time, 36 minutes after 
splashdown, he saw two aircraft, a P2V and, unexpectedly, a Piper Apache. The 
astronaut watched the planes circle, saw that the Apache pilot was photographing 
the area, and knew that he had been found. Twenty minutes later several SC-54 
aircraft arrived, and one dropped two frogmen, but Carpenter, watching other 
planes, did not see them bail out.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source103"><SUP>103</SUP></A>
<P>Airman First Class John F. Heitsch, dropping from the SC-54 transport about 
an hour and seven minutes after Carpenter had first hit the water, missed the 
life raft by a considerable distance. Releasing his chute harness, he dove under 
[457] the waves and swam the distance to the side of Carpenter's raft. "Hey!" 
called the frogman to the spaceman. Carpenter turned and with complete surprise 
asked, "How did you get here?" Shortly thereafter a second pararescue man, 
Sergeant Ray McClure, swam alongside and clutched the astronaut's raft. The two 
frogmen quickly inflated two other rafts and locked them to the spacecraft. 
McClure and Heitsch later described the astronaut as smiling, happy, and not at 
all tired. The pilot broke out his survival rations and offered some to the two 
Air Force swimmers, who declined the space food but drank some space water.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source104"><SUP>104</SUP></A>
<P>The three men, still without radio contact, perched on the three rafts and 
watched the planes circling above. One plane dropped the spacecraft flotation 
collar, which hit the water with a loud bang, breaking one of its compressed-air 
bottles. The swimmers retrieved and attached the flotation collar with only its 
top loop inflated and then crawled back onto their rafts. Shortly a parachute 
with a box at the end came floating lazily down some distance from the 
spacecraft. The men on the rafts supposed this was the needed radio, and one of 
the frogmen swam a considerable distance to get it. He returned with the 
container, opened it, and found that there was no radio inside, only a battery. 
Later Carpenter laughingly declined to repeat the swimmer's heated remarks.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source105"><SUP>105</SUP></A>
<P>The Air Force SA-16 seaplane from Roosevelt Roads arrived at the scene about 
an hour and a half after the spacecraft landed in the Atlantic. To the SA-16 
pilot the sea seemed calm enough to set his craft down upon and pick up the 
astronaut, but the Mercury Control Center directed the seaplane not to land. As 
later depicted by the news media and thoroughly discussed in Congress, this 
delay grew out of traditional rivalry between the Air Force and the Navy. 
Brigadier General Thomas J. Dubose, a former commander of the Air Rescue 
Service, wrote to Florida's United States Senator Spessard L. Holland, charging 
that Carpenter floated in the raft an hour and20 minutes longer than was 
necessary. D. Brainerd Holmes, a NASA official, testified at the hearings that 
Admiral John L. Chew, commander of the Project Mercury recovery forces, feared 
the seaplane might break apart if it landed on the choppy waters. Because of 
this, according to Holmes, the decision had been made to proceed with helicopter 
and ship pickup as originally planned.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source106"><SUP>106</SUP></A>
<P>After three hours of sitting on the sea in his raft, Carpenter was picked up 
by an HSS-2 helicopter, but either the rotorcraft settled as a swell arose or 
the winch operator accidentally lowered away, and the astronaut was dunked. Up 
went his arm and the hand holding the camera to keep the precious film dry. With 
nothing else amiss, Carpenter was hoisted aboard the helicopter, a drenched but 
happy astronaut. Richard A. Rink, a physician aboard, described Carpenter as 
exhilarated. The astronaut draped one leg out of the helicopter and, by cutting 
a hole in his sock, drained most of the water from his pressure suit. He then 
stood up and proceeded to pace around, sometimes settling in a seat, and 
intermittently talking about his flight. Carpenter arrived aboard the carrier 
<I>Intrepid</I> some four hours and 15 minutes after his return to Earth. [458] 
The medical examinations began immediately but were interrupted when the 
astronaut was called to the phone to receive what was by now President Kennedy's 
traditional congratulatory call. The President expressed his relief that 
Carpenter was safe and well, while Carpenter gave his "apologies for not having 
aimed a little better on reentry." From the <I>Intrepid</I> the astronaut was 
flown to Grand Turk Island, where, as Howard A. Minners, an Air Force physician 
assigned to Mercury, described it, Carpenter wanted to stay up late and talk.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source107"><SUP>107</SUP></A>
<P><I>Aurora 7</I>, picked up by the destroyer <I>Pierce</I>, was returned to 
Cape Canaveral the next day. When retrieved, the spacecraft was listing about 45 
degrees compared to the normal 15 to 20 degrees, and it contained about 65 
gallons of sea water, which would hamper the inspection and postflight analyses. 
Carpenter recalled two occasions on which the spacecraft had shipped small 
amounts of water, but he was unable to explain the larger amount found by the 
pickup crew. The exterior of the spacecraft showed the usual bluish and orange 
tinges on the shingles, several of which were slightly dented and scratched as 
after previous missions. Since there was no evidence of inflight damage, these 
slight scars presumably were the result of postflight handling. The spacecraft 
heatshield and main pressure bulkhead were in good condition except for a 
missing shield center plug, which had definitely been in place during reentry. 
Some of the honeycomb was crushed, resulting in minor deformation of the small 
tubing in that area. [459] Heitsch and McClure, the pararescue men, had reported 
the landing bag in good condition, but when it was hauled out of the water most 
of the straps were broken, probably by wave action. All in all, <I>Aurora 7</I> 
was in good shape and had performed well for Project Mercury's second manned 
orbital flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source108"><SUP>108</SUP></A>
<P>The postflight celebrations and honors followed the precedents and patterns 
established by Glenn's flight. Administrator Webb presented to Carpenter and 
Williams NASA Distinguished Service Medals in a ceremony at the Cape. Carpenter 
also learned of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's cabled congratulations. Then 
the astronaut's hometown, Boulder, Colorado, gave him a hero's welcome. After 
being awarded a degree by the University of Colorado, where he had lacked a 
credit in a heat-transfer course, the astronaut facetiously commented that the 
blazing MA-7 reentry surely qualified him as a master in the field of 
thermodynamics. Memorial Day found the pilot in Denver, where a crowd of 300,000 
people cheered and honored him. The next day he returned to work at Langley, 
where exhaustive technical debriefings were held to glean all the knowledge 
possible from MA-7.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source109"><SUP>109</SUP></A>
<P>In these postflight sessions the astronaut insisted that he knew what he 
wanted to do at all times, but that every task took a little longer than the 
time allotted by the flight plan. Some of the equipment, he said, was not easy 
to handle, particularly the special films that he had to load into a camera. As 
a consequence he had been unable to get all the pictures the Weather Bureau had 
requested for its satellite photography program. Moreover, the flight plan that 
had been available during training was only a tentative one, and the final plan 
had been completed only a short while before he suited up for the launch. 
Carpenter felt that the completed plan should be in the astronaut's hands at 
least two months before a scheduled flight and that the flight agenda should 
allow more time for the pilot to observe, evaluate, and record. When asked about 
fuel consumption by the high thrusters, Carpenter replied that the 24-pounders 
were unnecessary for the orbital phase of a flight.
<P>The astronaut recommended that some method be devised for closing off the 
high thrusters while the automatic control system was in operation. He granted 
that on the fly-by-wire, low-thruster operation, the spacecraft changed its 
attitude slowly, as was shown by the needle movement, and that the pilot would 
have to wait momentarily to pick up the desired attitude change rate. For 
tracking tasks, however, the manual- proportional mode served well; attitude 
changes could be made with only a gentle touch of the handcontroller. Talking 
with newsmen after the flight, Carpenter assumed full responsibility for his 
high fuel consumption. He pointed out, however, that what he had learned would 
be valuable for longer Mercury missions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source110"><SUP>110</SUP></A>
<P>As mid-year 1962 approached, Project Mercury faced yet another crossroad. Had 
enough been learned during the two three-orbit flights to justify going on to 
longer missions? Joe W. Dodson, a Manned Spacecraft Center engineer, speaking 
before the Exchange Club of Hampton, Virginia, indicated that the MSC designers 
[460] and planners and the operations team were well pleased with the lessons 
derived from Glenn, from Carpenter, and from their spacecraft. They were pleased 
especially at how well the combination of man and machine had worked.
<P>Shortly thereafter, the press began to speculate that NASA might try a 
one-day orbital flight before 1963. Administrator Webb, however, sought to 
scotch any premature guesswork until Gilruth and his MSC team could made a firm 
decision. He stated that there might well be another three-orbit mission, but 
added that consideration was being given to a flight of as many as six orbits 
with recovery in the Pacific. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA's "general manager," 
told congressional leaders that if a decision had to be made on the day on which 
he was speaking, it would probably be for another flight such as Glenn and 
Carpenter had made. But many members of Congress wanted to drop a third 
triple-orbit mission in favor of a flight that would come closer to or even 
surpass Gherman Titov's 17-orbit experience.
<P>On June 27, 1962, NASA Headquarters ended the speculation by announcing that 
Walter Schirra would pilot the next mission for as many as six orbits, possibly 
by the coming September, with L. Gordon Cooper as alternate pilot.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-9.htm#source111"><SUP>111</SUP></A> 
The original Mercury objectives had been met and passed; now it was time to 
proceed to new objectives - longer missions, different in quality as well as 
quantity of orbits. Project Mercury had twice accomplished the mission for which 
it was designed, but in so doing its end had become the means for further ends.

almost ideal, the flight path angle and velocity being only .004 degree and 2 
feet per second low, respectively. This provided an orbital trajectory of 89.96 
miles (perigee) and 144.4 miles (apogee). There was only one anomaly during the 
powered phase of the flight. The primary auxiliary cutoff signal for the 
sustainer engine was transmitted by the General Electric-Burroughs guidance 
system simultaneously with sustainer engine cutoff. The backup auxiliary 
sustainer cutoff signal had preceded this transmission by .44 second. But the 
abort enabling switch in the Control Center was in the normal position; since 
both signals did not lock, an improper signal was prevented. If the launch 
vehicle had accepted the erroneous signal, a velocity decrement of about 110 
feet per second might have resulted, causing marginal conditions in the 
go-for-mission decision. ("Postlaunch Memorandum Report for MA-7"; "Project 
Mercury Quarterly Status Report No. 15 for Period Ending July 31, 1962," NASA/

malfunction of the horizon scanner circuit was a random component failure. Plans 
were made to try to recover the antenna canister on the next flight for 
postflight analysis of the scanner unit located in that component. ("Project 
Mercury Quarterly Status Report No. 15.") Concerning the undesirable suit 
temperatures, Frank H. Samonski, Jr., capsule environmental monitor, believed a 
partial freezing in the suit circuit caused an obstruction in the heat 
exchanger. Carpenter was comfortable once again by the end of the first orbit; 
he was hot again during the second; and he finally got the suit temperature down 
to a comfortable level on the third. Suit inlet temperatures ranged between 62 
degrees to about 86 degrees during the flight. In all, Carpenter made 13 
attempts to adjust the setting to a comfortable range.

the weight and space it occupied in the spacecraft. This certainly would be 
true, he felt, when longer Mercury missions required more oxygen, water, and 
control fuel. On other aspects of the flight, Carpenter reported that he even 
saw a dirt road so clearly that he had the impression that if a vehicle had come 
along he could have seen it, too. In general, he found the daylight view from 
orbit similar to a view from a high-flying aircraft. He said that navigation at 
night might be accomplished by using a known star on the horizon.

xylose tablet without difficulty. At about midway of the second orbit, the 
flight controller recommended that the pilot drink water freely to compensate 
for sweating. Carpenter drank about 1213 cc of water - 60 percent while in 
flight and the remainder while on the life raft awaiting recovery. During the 
postflight debriefings, Carpenter suggested that henceforth food bags should be 
transparent and that something should be done about the chocolate items, which 
had melted in the fluctuating warmth of the cabin.

Life Systems Division had conducted a manned test to investigate the reentry 
heating that had occurred. Results showed that closing the helmet visor before 
reentry and letting the suit circuit operate separately provided a more 
comfortable environment. At the same time it was decided to lengthen the suit 
inlet hose. ("Activity Report, Life Systems Division," MSC, April 30, 1962.) 
After .05 g had been passed on Carpenter's flight, the liquid in the capillary 
tube began to drain. Thus the results tended to confirm capillary action theory. 
The ability to maintain a stable fluid position during angular acceleration 
imposed by the reaction control system indicated that this method of ullage 
control was valid. The results obtained during MA-7 could be extrapolated for 
propellants in accordance with laws governing each, namely, surface tension, 
fluid temperature, and known capillary tube diameter. "Postlaunch Memorandum

been received. Engineers believed that this was caused by a mixing of radio- 
frequency signals, which generated sufficient strength to energize one relay in 
the command system. This anomaly had been corrected by exchanging the 
low-frequency telemetry components for others operating on a higher frequency. 
("Weekly Activities Report," March 17, 1962; "Highlights, Activities Report,

remained unexplained. Tests in early May 1962, at El Centro, Calif., using the

contentions were borne out by the changes that were effected. For one thing a 
drive was made to have a flight plan specifying fewer activities ready well 
before the next flight. Also, a switch was integrated in the spacecraft by which 
the pilot could switch off and switch on the high thrusters. If the pilot forgot 
to reactivate the thrusters, an automatic override ensured their availability
