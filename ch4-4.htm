<H1>Man In Space Soonest?</H1>[91] Officially NACA still was acting as 
consultant and tester for the Air Force and industry on spacecraft design and 
development. ARDC had sent its abbreviated development plan for a manned orbital 
capsule, based on conclusions reached at the Ballistic Missile Division 
conference, to Headquarters USAF on March 14. Five days later Air Force Under 
Secretary Marvin A. MacIntyre requested $133 million from ARPA for manned 
satellite development during fiscal year 1959. On the same day that Eisenhower 
proposed the civilian agency to Congress, General White, Air Force Chief of 
Staff, secured approval for a man-in-space project from the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. Despite the introduction of the administration bill in Congress and the 
resultant tabling the next month of the proposed agreement between White and 
Hugh Dryden for a joint Air Force-NACA manned satellite project, NACA continued 
to furnish advice and information to the Air Force.<A

<P>Throughout most of April, representatives from the various offices within 
ARDC, forming a "Man-in-Space Task Force" at the Ballistic Missile Division, 
worked on an "Air Force Manned Military Space System Development Plan." The 
final goal was to "achieve an early capability to land a man on the moon and 
return him safely to earth." The first of four phases, called 
"Man-in-Space-Soonest," involved orbiting a ballistic capsule, first carrying 
instruments, then primates, and finally a man. In the second phase, 
"Man-in-Space-Sophisticated," a heavier capsule, capable of a 14-day flight, 
would be put in orbit. "Lunar Reconnaissance," the third phase, would soft-land 
on the Moon with instruments, including a television camera. The last phase was 
"Manned Lunar Landing and Return," wherein primates, then men, would be orbited 
around the Moon, landed on its surface, and returned safely. The whole 
undertaking was supposed to cost $1.5 billion, a level of financial support that 
should complete the program by the end of 1965. The Thor-Vanguard, the Thor with 
a fluorine upper stage, and a "Super Titan" topped by fluorine second and third 
stages would be the launch vehicles.<A

<P>The detailed designs and procedures for the Man-in-Space-Soonest portion of 
the long-range program went to Headquarters USAF on May 2. Based on Thor-117L, 
Thor-Vanguard, and Thor-fluorine booster combinations, the "Soonest" concept 
posited a manned orbit of Earth on the tenth launch of the Thor-fluorine system, 
in October 1960.<A

<P>Meanwhile, on April 30, the contractor team of Avco and Convair, which, since 
the Sputniks, had spent more time and money on manned satellite design than 
other industrial firms, presented to the Air Force a highly detailed proposal 
for development of a "minimum" vehicle. Featuring the "bare" Atlas, the basic 
"one and one-half stage" ICBM with no second stage, the Avco-Convair approach 
would orbit a man inside a sphere weighing 1500-2000 pounds. The steel-mesh drag 
brake, a metallic, inverted parachute, would be used for atmospheric entry.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-4.htm#source51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> 
[92] Specialists at the Ballistic Missile Division concluded that using the 
"bare" Atlas would save only three or four months of development time, that it 
would necessitate an undesirably low orbital altitude, that it ignored the 
prospect of dangerously high reentry g forces following an "abort" with what was 
essentially a single-stage booster, and that it presented little "growth 
potential," in contrast to the Thor fluorine system.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-4.htm#source52"><SUP>52</SUP></A> 
As early as March, moreover, ARDC's advisers in NACA, led by Maxime Faget, had 
criticized the complex drag-brake apparatus as "poor policy that might interfere 
with the early completion of the program as well as being a totally unnecessary 
device."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-4.htm#source53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
<P>However, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff LeMay, whose directive back in 
February had accelerated the proposed military manned satellite project, now 
ordered a reevaluation of the Avco-Convair scheme. LeMay felt this was possibly 
a cheaper way to get a man into space than Man-in-Space-Soonest, which called 
for an expenditure of more than $100 million for fiscal 1959. On May 20, 
Lieutenant General Samuel E. Anderson, Commander of ARDC, replied that in view 
of a general lack of confidence within ARDC in the Avco metal shuttlecock 
device, the Air Force should pursue the Man-in-Space-Soonest approach. LeMay 
accepted this recommendation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-4.htm#source54"><SUP>54</SUP></A> 
Henceforth, although there would be significant amendments to 
Man-in-Space-Soonest, the Air Force's own plan would encounter diminishing 
competition from would-be contractors' alternatives.
<P>While Anderson was discouraging LeMay's interest in the Avco-Convair 
proposal, General Schriever, Commander of the Ballistic Missile Division, wrote 
Anderson that his office was ready to proceed with a manned orbital project; the 
selection of a capsule contractor awaited only allocation of sufficient funds. 
But ARDC still could not secure full authorization from the Advanced Research 
Projects Agency, under which the Air Force would have to fund a project to put a 
man in orbit. ARPA had sketched the Soonest plan before the National Security 
Council Planning Board, which supposedly had a "feeling of great urgency to 
achieve . . . Man-in-Space-Soonest at the earliest possible date." But ARPA 
Director Johnson still shrank from the initial $100-million-plus request 
contained in the program outline.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-4.htm#source55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
<P>The main trouble was the high cost of mating the intermediate-range Thor with 
117L and Vanguard second stages, developing an entirely new rocket with a 
fluorine powerplant, and carrying out perhaps as many as 30 development flights 
before trying to orbit a manned capsule.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-4.htm#source56"><SUP>56</SUP></A> 
Late in May, Air Force Under Secretary MacIntyre and Assistant Secretary Richard 
E. Horner suggested that making the Atlas a carrier for manned flight might cut 
program costs below the $100 million mark. ARDC then had its Ballistic Missile 
Division prepare an alternative approach for Man-in-Space-Soonest. The BMD 
answer was that using the Atlas would mean reducing the orbital altitude of the 
2,000-3,000-pound capsule from about 170 miles to about 115 miles. This in turn 
would mean that voice contact would be lost for long periods unless more orbital 
tracking stations were built around the globe. Despite these reservations, on 
June 15, the Ballistic [93] Missile Division sent to Washington a revised 
development plan for orbiting a man in an Atlas-boosted ballistic capsule by 
April 1960 at a total cost of $99.3 million. The next day ARPA gave its approval 
to the revised "Soonest" plan and authorized the Air Force to proceed with study 
contracts on the life support system of the proposed manned capsule. The Wright 
Air Development Center let two concurrent three-month study contracts, at 
$370,000 each, to North American Aviation and General Electric, which were to 
design the space cabin and ecological mechanisms and build "mockups" - 
full-scale working models - of the capsule interior.<A

<P>By late June, with the reworked version of the space bill proposed by the 
Eisenhower administration almost ready to be voted on in Congress, it was 
apparent that the Air Force was in much more of a hurry to hurl a man into orbit 
than was ARPA. The new Defense Department agency remained reluctant to commit 
heavy financing to a project that might well be abandoned or transferred when 
the civilian space organization proposed by Eisenhower came into existence. 
Throughout June and into July, an ARPA Man in Space Panel, headed by Samuel B. 
Batdorf, received briefings and proposals from the Air Force and in turn 
reported to Herbert F. York, chief scientist in ARPA. But during these weeks 
Faget, serving as the regular NACA representative on the ARPA panel, began to 
detect a definite change in the attitude of ARPA personnel toward NACA. The 
essence of this change, according to Faget, was the growing belief that now 
perhaps ARPA should give more advice to NACA on space technology than vice 
versa, as had been the case. For example, York recommended to Johnson that NACA 
Director Dryden's "personal concurrence" be obtained before any Air Force 
man-in-space program was formally approved by ARPA.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch4-4.htm#source58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
<P>On June 25 and 26, the ARPA Man in Space Panel sponsored a meeting in 
Washington for representatives from Headquarters ARDC, the Ballistic Missile 
Division, Convair, Lockheed, Space Technology Laboratories, and NACA. The 
meeting was called to resolve such outstanding questions as the relationship 
between payload weight and the lifting capabilities of various booster systems, 
booster reliability, and ablation versus heat sink thermal protection 
techniques. The gathering produced little specific technical agreement. Into 
July, ARPA continued to hold back adequate "go-ahead" funds for a full-fledged 
Air Force effort to send a manned vehicle into orbit.<A
