<H1>One World Network</H1>From the beginning of 1959, the United States' first 
manned space flight program was committed to manned ballistic suborbital flights 
as prerequisite to a manned orbital flight, and to a world-wide tracking and 
communications network as a safeguard for its man in orbit. Both of these 
distinguishing features were means of man-rating its machines. The second began 
to be implemented only in the latter half of 1959, after NASA Headquarters had 
relieved STG of the burden of the network.
<P>Neither suborbital flight nor the tracking network for Mercury was 
established with any real notion of what the Soviets were doing toward a manned 
space flight program. But that the Soviets were doing something toward this end 
was made perfectly clear by Premier Nikita Khrushchev during his autumn tour of 
the United States. Having presented President Eisenhower with a medallion of the 
Soviet coat-of-arms borne by <I>Lunik II</I>, the first manmade object to hit 
the Moon, Khrushchev visited Hollywood, Iowa cornfields, and the Presidential 
retreat at Camp David. His departure coincided with press announcements that 
Soviet pilots were training for an assault on the cosmos. The first pictures of 
the back of the Moon, made by <I>Lunik III</I> on October 4, demonstrated 
impressive Soviet sophistication in guidance, control, and telemetry, if not in 
photography.<A

<P>If various American government agencies late in 1959 knew more than the 
public did about the probable speed and direction of the Soviet manned space 
[214] program, this information was not passed down to the Space Task Group. Top 
administrators in Washington were undoubtedly accorded "need-to-know" briefings 
on Soviet progress, but at the working level around STG at Langley there was no 
such privileged information on the so-called "space race." In fact, not until 
mid-December did STG learn some of the operational details of Air Force programs 
then being conducted on the West Coast. Even the Dyna-Soar program, so heavily 
influenced by Hartley A. Soulé, John W. Becker, and others at Langley, seemed at 
times to be out of reach to Mercury engineers.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source99"><SUP>99</SUP></A>
<P>In the "spirit of Camp David" the seven astronauts themselves proposed an 
exchange of visits and information with their Soviet counterparts, but to no 
avail. Proof that the United States and the Soviet Union could agree was shown 
in the Antarctic Treaty signed by 12 nations, including the two giants, on 
December 1, 1959. In the same spirit only a week later the NASA Administrator 
offered the services of the Mercury tracking network in support of any manned 
space flight the U.S.S.R. might care to undertake, but this offer also was 
stillborn. So sparse seemed available official information on Soviet manned 
space plans that Paul Purser, as special assistant to Gilruth, assumed an extra 
duty by beginning a scrapbook of published accounts relating to Soviet manned 
space flight plans.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source100"><SUP>100</SUP></A> 
It would have been "nice to know" in more detail what the Soviets were planning 
and how well they were proceeding, but STG's "need to know" was mainly 
psychological curiosity. Such information, if available, probably would have 
made little difference to the technological momentum of Project Mercury at the 
end of 1959. The impetus generated for the project by that time was truly 
formidable and still accelerating.
<P>NASA Headquarters had relieved STG of developing the global range network in 
the spring of 1959, believing that the Tracking and Ground Instrumentation Unit 
(TAGIU) at Langley and the communications center at Goddard Space Flight Center 
together could develop radar and radio facilities more expeditiously. The wisdom 
of this assignment would prove itself; the communications network was never a 
cause for delay in Mercury operational schedules.
<P>The decision to build an extensive new tracking network girdling the globe 
had derived largely from Langley studies of operational tracking requirements 
made by Edmond C. Buckley, Charles Mathews, Howard C. Kyle, Harry H. Ricker, and 
Clifford H. Nelson in the summer of 1958. Then followed four extensive and 
independent studies by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ford, Space 
Electronics, and Radio Corporation of America in the spring of 1959. Many 
interrelated technical, operational, and diplomatic considerations were involved 
in the evolution of the network, with pilot safety and limited capsule battery 
power setting the first standards.
<P>Next to manufacturing the capsule itself, the Mercury network was the most 
expensive part of the entire program. But that network represented a capital 
investment in tracking and communications ability that NASA would also use 
effectively for scientific satellites and space probes. The full compass of the 
[215] tracking range and communications network built for Project Mercury is 
beyond the scope of this volume, but salient features of the chain of tracking 
stations, of the communications grid, and of the ground instrumentation planned 
for Mercury set other basic parameters for the project. Hartley A. Soulé, the 
aeronautical scientist who directed Langley's part of the establishment, made a 
circumnavigation of the Earth to prepare the circumferential path for orbital 
overflights.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source101"><SUP>101</SUP></A>
<P>When Christopher Kraft spoke to the Society of Experimental Test Pilots on 
October 9, 1959, he explained certain of the major criteria used to choose the 
orbital plane for Mercury and to select ground stations to monitor the man in 
orbit. "Since the first manned orbital flight will be a new type of operation 
involving many new experiences," Kraft said, "it would be desirable to keep the 
time in orbit as short as practical, while at the same time making an orbital 
flight." Emphasizing the necessity to secure an accurate and almost 
instantaneous determination of the potential orbit before actual insertion, as 
well as an exact retrofiring point and thereby a low-dispersion "footprint," or 
recovery area, Kraft explained how the first manned orbital mission should shoot 
for three rather than one or two orbits. He also listed four specific reasons 
why the best orbit inclination to the equatorial plane would be 32.5 degrees and 
the most desirable launching azimuth, or direction, would be 73 degrees true: 
(1) maximum use should be made of existing tracking stations and communications 
facilities; (2) the Atlantic Missile Range should be used for both the launching 
and the planned recovery area; (3) the orbital track should pass directly over 
the continental United States as much as possible to maximize unbroken tracking, 
especially during reentry; and (4) the orbital path should be planned to remain 
over friendly territory and temperate climatic zones.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source102"><SUP>102</SUP></A>
<P>These criteria constrained the choice of both Mercury's orbital plane and its 
launching azimuth. East-northeast was an unusual firing direction from Cape 
Canaveral, where ballistic missiles were normally shot southeastward down the 
Atlantic range. Taking the sinusoidal track displaced for each orbit as it would 
look on a Mercator world projection, Soulé, Francis B. Smith, and G. Barry 
Graves of Langley, Mathews, Kraft, and Kyle in STG, and many others resolved the 
complex trades between the Atlas booster characteristics, capsule weight 
limitations, launch safety considerations, suitable recovery areas, existing 
Defense Department tracking and communications networks, and available land for 
locating instrument stations. Soulé and his Tracking Unit at Langley shouldered 
most of the responsibility for the compromises between what should and could be 
done with electronic communications and telemetry to promote pilot safety and 
ensure mission success.
<P>While STG delegated such decisions as whether to select sites in Kenya or 
Guadalcanal, where to use C- or S-band radars, and whether to lay a cable or 
build a redundant control center on Bermuda, it kept tight control on all 
matters affecting control of the missions and especially of the decisions on 
orbital parameters. [216] John Mayer and Carl Huss, leading STG's Mission 
Analysis Branch, had learned their celestial mechanics from the traditions 
established by Johannes Kepler, Sir Isaac Newton, and Forest R. Moulton, but 
from 1957 through 1959 more and more data from various artificial satellites 
continually refined their calculations. Keeping in close touch with STL on the 
improving Atlas performance characteristics, Mayer's group sought to establish 
the ideal "launch window" or orbital insertion conditions. Not until May 1960 
were these parameters established.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source103"><SUP>103</SUP></A>
<P>John D. Hodge, another Anglo-Canadian, who helped Mathews learn how the 
Defense Department launching and tracking teams operated at the Atlantic and the 
Pacific missile ranges, explained how the major compromise on man-rating the 
worldwide network was achieved in 1959. Physicians like Lieutenant Colonel David 
G. Simons, of Project Manhigh fame; Major Stanley C. White, on loan to STG from 
the Air Force; and Colonel George M. Knauf, the staff surgeon at the Air Force 
Missile Test Center, had argued for continuous medical monitoring and complete 
voice and television coverage around the world. Physicist-engineers, like Soulé, 
Smith, and Graves, saw these demands as virtually impossible. The doctors were 
forced to retreat when asked what could possibly be done after diagnosis had 
been made on an ailing astronaut in orbit. Twenty minutes would be the absolute 
minimum time required to return him to Earth from orbital altitude after 
retrofiring. "Aeromedical clinicians finally had to agree late in 1959," said 
Hodge, "that they could do little if anything to help the astronaut until he was 
recovered." Once in orbit the pilot's safety primarily depended upon mission 
success. Mission success depended at this stage primarily upon positive control 
over reentry and recovery operations. The ground command and tracking systems 
were consequently more important than complete voice or telemetry coverage.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source104"><SUP>104</SUP></A>
<P>Aside from the tight security surrounding the Atlas ICBM, perhaps the most 
closely guarded operational secret in Project Mercury was the ground control 
command frequencies established at strategic points around the Earth to enable 
flight controllers to retrieve capsule and astronaut from space in case of 
extreme necessity. Unlike the technological secret of the heatshield, this 
highly reliable command system was not classified as an industrial production 
secret, but rather to avoid any possible tampering or sabotage by electronic 
countermeasures.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source105"><SUP>105</SUP></A>
<P>Once the specifications for the tracking and ground information systems for 
Project Mercury had been drawn up and distributed at a bidders' briefing on May 
21, 1959, the Tracking Unit at Langley proceeded to select a prime contractor 
for the tracking network. In mid-June the organization, membership, and 
procedures for a technical evaluation board and source selection panel were 
specified. A month later the evaluation of industrial proposals was completed. 
The Western Electric Company, supplier of the parts and builder of the network 
for the American Telephone and Telegraph system, won the prime contract to build 
the Mercury network. After NASA sent Western Electric a letter of intent [217] 
on July 30, 1959, Rod Goetchius and Paul Lein began organizing the resources of 
Western Electric for Project Mercury.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source106"><SUP>106</SUP></A>
<P>Soulé arranged for six site survey teams chosen from his group at Langley to 
travel over Africa, Australia, various Pacific islands, and North America to 
choose locations for communications command posts. Much of the traveling Soulé 
did himself; he enjoyed both the technical intricacy and the scientific 
diplomacy of getting foreign scientists to urge their governments to cooperate 
for the tracking stations.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source107"><SUP>107</SUP></A>
<P>Meanwhile NASA Headquarters acquired from the National Academy of Sciences 
Arnold W. Frutkin, who had had experience during the IGY in dealing with the 
State Department and foreign governments for international cooperation in 
scientific affairs. Beginning in September 1959, Frutkin laid the staffwork 
basis with the United Kingdom for Mercury tracking stations in Nigeria and 
Zanzibar. Zanzibar and Mexico in particular appeared reluctant to accept at face 
value the United States' good - that is, civilian - intentions for Mercury. The 
President's brother, Milton Eisenhower, personally obtained consent for full 
Mexican cooperation.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source108"><SUP>108</SUP></A>
<P>By the end of November, preliminary designs for the Mercury tracking network 
were almost completed and a five-company industrial team was developing 
facilities. Western Electric had subcontracted to the Bendix Corporation for the 
search radars, telemetry equipment, and the unique display consoles for each 
site. Burns and Roe, Inc., took over the engineering and construction of the 
buildings, roads, towers, and other structural facilities at 14 sites. 
International Business Machines Corporation installed the computers at Goddard 
Space Flight Center, the Cape, and Bermuda, and supplied programming and 
operational services. Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., designed and developed 
the operations room of the Mercury Control Center at the Cape, and furnished a 
special procedures trainer for flight controllers as well as overall network 
systems analysis.
<P>Eighteen ground stations were chosen for terminals in the communications 
network. Eleven of these sites, equipped with long-range precision radar 
equipment, would double for the tracking system. Sixteen of the stations were to 
have telemetry receivers, but only 8 of the 18 would be located on military 
missile ranges where existing radar and other facilities could be used. One new 
station (at Corpus Christi, Texas) would have to be established in the United 
States. Two stations were mobile, located on tracking ships at sea; seven were 
built in foreign countries. In November 1959, the total cost for the system was 
estimated at $41,000,000. The target dates for operational readiness were set as 
June 1, 1960, for suborbital Atlantic missions and as New Year's Day 1961 for 
worldwide operations.
<P>The tracking and communications network for Project Mercury was a monumental 
enterprise that spanned three oceans and three continents by means of 
approximately 177,000 miles of hard-line communications circuitry. [218] 
Although most of these wires were leased, the subtotals were likewise 
impressive: 102,000 miles of teletype, 60,000 miles of telephone, and over 
15,000 miles of high-speed data circuits - plus the microwave radio telemetry 
and telecommunications circuits, which are not so easily described in linear 
distances. Although colossal in conception and execution, the Mercury tracking 
and communications network fell far short of 100-percent voice contact, 
telemetry contact, or tracking capability, not to speak of complete television 
coverage, which some aeromedical designers would have included.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source109"><SUP>109</SUP></A>
<P>Despite NASA's boast about "real-time," or instantaneous, communications, the 
historical novelty of the Mercury communications network lay less in the 
temporal than in the spatial dimension. So-called "instantaneous" communications 
were born in the l9th century with the installation of "speed-of-light" wired 
communications - the telegraph, submarine cables, and the telephone. Neither 
radio nor radiotelephone of the 20th century brought strategic placement of 
telecommunications installations into such a unified network that the time of 
signals from antipodal sides of the world could be reduced to an "instant." 
Transoceanic telephone conversations between Hong Kong and Houston, for example, 
still delayed responses by enough time to give one the feeling of talking to 
oneself. Synchronous communications satellites supposedly would soon change all 
this, but surface communications used for Mercury operations cost some slight, 
but nonetheless real, time in transmission. The real innovation of the Mercury 
network lay in its combination of extremely rapid communications lines, linked 
and cross-linked around the world, culminating in digital data processing, which 
displayed its results in Florida virtually as soon as computed in Maryland.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source110"><SUP>110</SUP></A>
<P>Only the development of digital electronic computers in recent decades made 
possible quick enough data digestion and display to allow communications 
engineers to speak of "real-time" presentations for Project Mercury. Telemetry 
grew more sophisticated separately in industrial and military circles until 
biomedical telemetry became by 1959 a recognized part of the margin of safety 
for manned space flight. But computer technology did not suffer this kind of 
bifurcated development. In fact, commercially sold digital computers were ready 
and actually operating under canvas tents while workmen were laying block and 
brick for the permanent building to surround them. No construction time could be 
lost if the communications and computing center was to be completed at the 
Goddard Center early in 1960.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source111"><SUP>111</SUP></A>
<P>Harry J. Goett, formerly chief of Ames' Full Scale and Flight Research 
Division, took the reins as director of Goddard in September 1959. He found that 
the nucleus of some 150 Vanguard people had grown to approximately 500 
employees. After <I>Vanguard III</I> finally terminated that program 
successfully on September 18, about one third of Goddard's complement turned to 
developing the facilities and teamwork for a space operations data control and 
reduction center. Actual direction of all Mercury computer programming was done 
from [219] Langley by J. J. Donegan and H. W. Tindall, Jr., of the Tracking and 
Ground Instrumentation Unit. But in August 1959, John T. Mengel of Goddard 
conferred with Soulé; together with Edmond Buckley of NASA Headquarters they 
decided to assign about 14 senior engineers to specific Mercury problems. From 
October 1959 over the next 18 months this Goddard staff tripled in size and then 
doubled again when the Tracking Unit's responsibility and key men were 
transferred to Goddard.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source112"><SUP>112</SUP></A>
<P>To raise the reliability of the computers and telemetry used in Project 
Mercury, redundancy and cybernetics were again incorporated in design. [220] For 
example, "real-time multi-programming" was the name for a technique and some 
hardware developed as digestive aids for Mercury data processing machines. M. J. 
Buist and G. M. Weinberg of Goddard tried to describe their efforts to achieve 
"real-time" data: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The problem . . . is to develop a real-time computer system 
  capable of receiving input arriving at asynchronous times and at different 
  rates of transmission with minimum delay. It must be capable of performing 
  mathematical computations while input is being received and edited. 
  Simultaneously, it must send out information to numerous sites in varied 
  formats and at varied speeds without human intervention.<A 
  href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source113"><SUP>113</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>For 
this purpose two IBM 7090 transistorized computers were installed at Goddard, in 
Maryland. Two older model IBM 709 vacuum tube computers, one installed for NASA 
on Bermuda and the other an Air Force "IP" (impact predictor) for the Range 
Safety Officer at the Cape, were modified to handle a computer logic designed 
with equivalent alternative programs rather than with the usual subroutines. By 
means of special memory traps and automatic switching, the most critical data 
reduction operations were redundantly programmed into the IBM machines to ensure 
cross-checks on the man-rated machines in orbit.
<P>Curiously, the difference between the IBM 709s and 7090s, so far as 
reliability was concerned in 1959, was the same difference the Mercury team 
encountered with miniaturization techniques. Although solid-state electronic 
devices like transistors, printed circuits, and molectronic capacitors promised 
tremendous savings in space, weight, and trouble-free operation, they were as 
yet so new that their reliability was not proved. The two 7090s at Goddard, 
therefore, were necessary redundancies for the heart or brain of the global 
tracking and target acquisition grid. The two independent and separate 709s at 
the Cape and Bermuda, amply stocked with spare parts, had the more limited but 
no less critical job of computing whether orbital launch conditions had been 
met. The two new transistorized computers at Goddard should man-rate the 
worldwide Mercury switchboard and data reduction. The older, more reliable 
vacuum-tube computers in the Mercury launch area should ensure nearly perfect 
orbital insertion conditions before the point of no return.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch7-8.htm#source114"><SUP>114</SUP></A>
<P>That point of no return was first selected as insurance against landing in 
Africa. Later refinements to the "go/no go" decision point incorporated 
parameters from the standardized atmosphere, better drag coefficients, 
perturbation theory, preferred recovery areas, the improved Atlas booster, and 
the heavier Mercury capsule. These and many other intertwined considerations 
made the efforts of man-rating the machines for Mercury seem almost as limitless 
a task as space is a limitless continuum. They had the effect of canceling, for 
the time being, STG's hopes for an 18-orbit, or day long, final Mercury mission.
<P>By the end of 1959 Project Mercury was well under way on many different 
fronts. The American astronauts, supposedly shifting from academically oriented 
training to practical engineering and operational exercises, were widely known 
as [221] men in training to challenge the impressive Soviet performances in 
space. Most recently, <I>Lunik III</I> had photographed the unknown side of the 
Moon for the first time. A few Soviet names and faces appeared in Western 
publications as challenging indications that the U.S.S.R. too was training 
pilots for space flights. But the imagination and hopes of the American people 
were pinned on the seven of their own, each of whom had the chance of being the 
first human being to orbit Earth. Publicized in accord with the law and in 
response to public demand, the plans and progress of Project Mercury were for 
the most part open knowledge. NASA Headquarters was swamped with inquiries of 
all kinds from all sorts of people. The field managers of Mercury had ruefully 
discovered that people, or at least reporters, were more interested in people 
than machines, so they allowed "Shorty" Powers to skew publicity toward 
machine-rating the men rather than man-rating the machines.<A
