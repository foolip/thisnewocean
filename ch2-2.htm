<H1>Beginnings of Space Medicine</H1>After the Second World War the Air Force 
acquired the talents of a number of scientists who had done much remarkable 
research on the medical aspects of high-speed, high-altitude airplane flight for 
Germany's Luftwaffe.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-2.htm#source2"><SUP>2</A></SUP> 
Most of these German physicians, physiologists, and psychologists were brought 
to the expanding Aeromedical Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near 
Dayton, Ohio. Six of the more prominent German aeromedical specialists, Hubertus 
Strughold, Hans-Georg Clamann, Konrad Buettner, Siegfried J. Gerathewohl, and 
the brothers Fritz and Heinz Haber, were assigned as research physicians to the 
Air Force School of Aviation Medicine, located on the scrub prairies of south 
central Texas at Randolph Air Force Base, outside San Antonio. The commandant of 
the school was Colonel Harry G. Armstrong, author of the classic text in 
aviation medicine.<A

While heavily instrumented V-2s lumbered upward from White Sands and plastic 
research balloons lifted seeds, mice, hamsters, fruit flies, and other specimens 
into the upper atmosphere, Armstrong and his associates were already considering 
the medical implications of flight by man into the hostile space environment.
<P>In November 1948, Armstrong organized at Randolph a panel discussion on the 
"Aeromedical Problems of Space Travel." Featuring papers by Strughold and Heinz 
Haber and commentary by six well-known scientists from universities and the 
military, the symposium perhaps marked the beginning of formal, academic inquiry 
into the medical hazards of extra-atmospheric flight. Before this epochal 
gathering ended, Strughold had resolved the contradiction inherent in the title 
of the symposium by emphatically using the term "space medicine."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-2.htm#source4"><SUP>4</A></SUP>
<P>The following February, Armstrong set up the world's first Department of 
Space Medicine, headed by Strughold and including the Habers and Konrad 
Buettner.<A

In November 1951, at San Antonio, the School of Aviation Medicine and the 
privately financed Lovelace Foundation for Medical Research at Albuquerque, New 
Mexico, sponsored a symposium discreetly entitled "Physics and Medicine of the 
Upper Atmosphere." It was still not respectable to speak plainly of space flight 
within the Air Force, which only that year had cautiously reactivated its 
intercontinental ballistic missile project and remained sensitive to "Buck 
Rogers" epithets from members of Congress and the taxpaying public. A good 
portion of the material presented by the 44 speakers at the 1951 symposium, 
however, covered the nature of space, the mechanics of space flight, and the 
medical difficulties of sending a man beyond the sensible and breathable 
atmosphere.<A

<P><CITE>An important bridge from aviation medicine to space medicine was this 
chart by Hubertus Strughold in 1951. It related altitudes at which human 
functional borders occur with the altitudes at which the various physical 
characteristics of space occur.</CITE>

<P>It was at this meeting that Strughold, later to acquire a reputation as the 
"father of space medicine," put forth what is perhaps his most notable 
contribution - the concept of "aeropause," a region of "space-equivalent 
conditions" or [35] "atmospheric space equivalence." Strughold pointed out that 
while many astronomers, astrophysicists, and meteorologists set the boundary 
between the atmosphere and space at about 600 miles from Earth, the biological 
conditions of space begin much lower, at about 50,000 feet. Anoxia is 
encountered at 50,000 feet, the boiling point of body fluids at 63,000 feet, the 
necessity for carrying all respiratory oxygen within a manned compartment at 
80,000 feet, meteoroids at 75 miles, and the darkness of the space "void" at 100 
miles. Above 100 miles the atmosphere is imperceptible to the flyer. "What we 
call upper atmosphere in the physical sense," said Strughold, "must be considered 
- in terms of biology - as space in its total form." Hence manned ballistic or 
orbital flight at an altitude of 100 miles would be, for all practical purposes, 
space flight.<A

<P>The rocket-powered research airplanes of the postwar years, beginning with 
the X-1, the first manned vehicle to surpass the speed of sound, took American 
test pilots well into the region of space equivalence. On August 26, 1954, when 
Major Arthur Murray of the Air Force pushed the Bell X-1A to an altitude of [36] 
90,000 feet, he was above 90 percent of the sensible atmosphere. Two years 
later, in the more powerful Bell X-2, Air Force Captain Iven Kincheloe climbed 
to 126,000 feet, "a space-equivalent flight to a very high degree."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch2-2.htm#source8"><SUP>8</A></SUP> 
The X-15, still on the drawing boards in the mid-fifties, was being designed to 
rocket its pilot to an altitude of 50 miles at nearly seven times the speed of 
sound. And human-factors research in the X-15 project, involving the development 
and testing of a new full-pressure flying suit, centrifuge conditioning to high 
acceleration forces, and telemetering a wide range of physiological data in 
flight, would contribute substantially to medical planning for space travel.<A

People interested in the physiology and psychology of extra-atmospheric flight 
have devised a number of terms to describe their field of investigation - 
biomedicine, space biology, astrobiology, bioastronautics, aerospace medicine. 
The most suitable single term seems to be that used by Strughold, "space 
medicine." It is used throughout this work except where more precise 
terminology, such as "biodynamics," appears appropriate.
