<H1>An American in Orbit</H1>Glenn was awakened once again at 2:20 a.m. on 
February 20. After showering, he sat down to a breakfast of steak, scrambled 
eggs, toast, orange juice, and coffee. At 3:05 the astronauts' flight surgeon, 
William Douglas, gave him a brief physical examination.
<P>Douglas, Glenn, and his suit technician, Joe W. Schmitt, were only three of a 
multitude hard at work on the cloudy February morning. In the Mercury Control 
Center procedures log, the flight control team noted at 3:40 that they were "up 
and at it." The team immediately conducted a radar check, and although 
ionospheric conditions made the results poor the controllers believed the 
situation would improve soon. So they went on to check booster telemetry and the 
Control Center's voice intercom system, both of which were in good order. 
Shortly thereafter they found a faulty communication link that was supposed to 
be obtaining information about the capsule's oxygen system, but within minutes 
they had corrected the problem.<A

<P>At 4:27 a.m. Christopher Kraft, sitting before his flight director's console, 
received word that the global tracking network had been checked out and was 
ready. In Hangar S, Douglas placed the biosensors on Glenn, and Joe Schmitt 
began helping the astronaut don his 20-pound pressure suit. At 5:01 the Mercury 
Control Center learned that the astronaut was in the van and on his [423] way to 
the launch pad. The van moved slowly and arrived at 5:17, 20 minutes behind 
schedule. But the delay was of little consequence, for at 5:25 (T minus 120 
minutes) trouble had cropped up in the booster's guidance system. Since this 
came during the built-in 90-minute hold part of the countdown for the astronaut 
insertion activity, the delay was not likely to halt the readying procedures for 
very long. The installation of a spare unit and an additional 45 minutes 
required for its checkout, however, made a total of 135 minutes lost.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source28"><SUP>28</A></SUP>
<P>Because of overcast weather and the guidance problem in the Atlas, Glenn 
relaxed comfortably in the van until 5:58, when the sky began to clear. The 
capsule and booster validation checks were progressing normally as he emerged 
from the van, saluted the onlookers, and boarded the gantry elevator. At 6:03, 
the operations team noted in its procedures log, the astronaut "put a foot into 
the spacecraft." Once inside <I>Friendship 7</I>, Glenn noticed that the 
respiration sensor - a thermistor attached to the astronaut's microphone in the 
air stream of his breath - had shifted from where it had been fixed during the 
simulated flight. Stanley C. White pointed out to Williams that a correction 
could only be made by opening the suit, a very tricky operation atop the gantry. 
So the two officials decided to disregard the slipped thermistor, even though 
faulty data would result. White advised the range to ignore all respiratory 
transmissions.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source29"><SUP>29</A></SUP>
<P>At last the technicians began to bolt the hatch onto the spacecraft, but at 
7:10, with the countdown proceeding and most of the 70 bolts secured, a broken 
bolt was discovered. Although Grissom had flown in MR—4 with a broken hatch 
bolt, Williams, taking no chances this time, ordered removal and repair. Taking 
the hatch off and rebolting would require about 40 minutes, so the operations 
team took this opportunity to run still another check of the guidance system on 
Atlas 109-D. Glenn evidently maintained his composure during this hold, with his 
pulse ranging between 60 and 80 beats per minute. When a little more than half 
of the bolts had been secured, he peered through the periscope and remarked to 
Scott Carpenter and Alan Shepard in the Control Center, "Looks like the weather 
is breaking up."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source30"><SUP>30</A></SUP>
<P>Minutes later the hatch installation was completed and the cabin purge was 
started. A check of the cabin oxygen leakage rate indicated 500 cubic 
centimeters per minute, well within design specifications. At 8:05, T minus 60 
minutes, the countdown continued, but after 15 minutes a hold was called to add 
about 10 gallons of propellant to the booster's tanks. Glenn had been busily 
going over his capsule systems checklist. As the holds continued, he occupied 
his time and relieved the pressure at various points on his cramped body by 
pulling on the bungee-cord exercising device in front of his head in the 
capsule. The countdown resumed while the liquid oxygen was being pumped aboard 
the Atlas, but at T minus 22 minutes, 8:58, a fuel pump outlet valve stuck, 
causing still another hold.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source31"><SUP>31</A></SUP>
<P>At that point in the countdown, Glenn, the blockhouse and Control Center 
crews, and workers scurrying around and climbing on the gantry were joined by 
some 100 million people watching television sets in about 40 million homes [426] 
throughout the United States. Countless others huddled around radios in their 
homes or places of business and about 50,000 "bird watchers" stood on the 
beaches near Cape Canaveral, squinting toward the erect rocket gleaming in the 
distance. Some of the more hearty and sun-tanned spectators had been at the Cape 
since mid–January and had organized trailer towns, complete with "mayors." 
Mission announcer Powers, popularly known as "the voice of Mercury Control," who 
had been at his post in the Control Center since 5 o'clock that morning, went on 
the air to advise the waiting public of the status of the countdown and the 
cause for the present hold.
<P>With the stuck valve cleared, the count picked up at 9:25, but another 
suspenseful moment came at 6 1/2 minutes before launch time, when the Bermuda 
tracking station experienced an electrical power failure. Although the breakdown 
was brief, it took several more minutes to steady the Bermuda computer.
<P>At 9:47, after two hours and 17 minutes of holds and three hours and 44 
minutes after Glenn entered his "office," <I>Friendship 7</I> was launched on 
its orbital journey. The Atlas, supported by its tail of fire, lifted off its 
pad, and Powers made the announcement that this country had waited three long 
years to hear: "Glenn reports all spacecraft systems go! Mercury Control is go!" 
As Atlas 109-D lunged spaceward, Glenn's pulse rate climbed to 110, as expected. 
The Atlas and its control systems telemetered signals that they were functioning 
perfectly.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source32"><SUP>32</A></SUP>
<P>Half a minute after liftoff the General Electric-Burroughs guidance system 
locked onto a radio transponder in the booster to guide the vehicle until it was 
through the orbital insertion "window." The vibration at liftoff hardly bothered 
Glenn, but a hundred seconds later at max-q he reported, "It's a little bumpy 
about here." After the rocket plunged through the max-q region, the flight 
smoothed out; then two minutes and 14 seconds after launch, the outboard booster 
engines cut off and dropped away. Glenn saw a wisp of smoke and fleetingly 
thought the escape tower had jettisoned early, but that event occurred exactly 
on time, 20 seconds later.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source33"><SUP>33</A></SUP>
<P>When the tower separated, the vehicle combination pitched over still further, 
giving Glenn his first view of the horizon, which he described as "a beautiful 
sight, looking eastward across the Atlantic." Vibration increased as the fuel 
supply spewed out the sustainer engine nozzle, then abruptly stopped when the 
sustainer shut down. The sustainer had accelerated the capsule to a velocity 
only seven feet per second below nominal and had put the Atlas into an orbital 
trajectory only .05 of a degree low. Joyously the operations team noted in the 
log, "9:52- - -We are through the gates." Glenn received word that he could make 
at least seven orbits with the orbital conditions MA-6 had achieved. To 
Goddard's computers in Maryland the orbital insertion conditions appeared good 
enough for almost 100 orbits.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source34"><SUP>34</A></SUP>
<P>Although the posigrade rockets kicked the capsule loose from the booster at 
the correct instant, the five-second rate-damping operation started two and a 
half seconds late. This brief lapse caused a substantial initial roll error just 
as the [427] capsule began its turnaround. The attitude control system managed 
the deviation very well, but it was some 38 seconds before <I>Friendship 7</I> 
dropped into its proper orbital attitude. Turnaround spent 5.4 pounds of fuel 
from a total supply of 60.4 pounds (36 for automatic and 24.4 for manual 
control). Despite his slow automatic positioning maneuver, Glenn made his 
control checks with such ease that it seemed, he said, as if he were sitting in 
the procedures trainer. As Voas had asked him to do, the astronaut peered 
through the window at the tumbling Atlas tankage. It had come into view exactly 
as Ben F. McCreary of MSC had predicted it would. He could see the spent vehicle 
turning end over end, and he called out estimates of distances between the 
separating vehicles: "One hundred yards, two hundred yards." At one point 
Glenn's estimate matched the telemetry signal exactly. He visually tracked the 
sustainer intermittently for about eight minutes.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source35"><SUP>35</A></SUP>
<P>Glenn, noticing the onset of weightlessness, settled into orbital free flight 
with an inertial velocity of 17,544 miles per hour and reported that zero g was 
wholly pleasant. Although he could move well and see much through his 
trapezoidal window, he wanted to see even more. "I guess I'd like a glass 
capsule," he later quipped. Weightlessness also helped him as he used the 
hand-held camera. When his attention was drawn to a panel switch or readout, he 
simply left the "weightless" camera suspended and reached for the switch. 
Dutifully carrying out all of the head and body movements requested by Voas, he 
experienced none of the sensations reported by Gherman Titov. While any 
Glenn-Titov comparison might be ruled invalid since Titov reportedly became 
nauseated on his sixth orbit and Glenn flew only three orbits, MA-6 at least was 
to demonstrate to the American medical community that there were no discernible 
adverse physiological effects from over four hours of weightlessness.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source36"><SUP>36</A></SUP>
<P>The first orbit of <I>Friendship 7</I> began ticking off like clockwork with 
the Canary Islands reporting all capsule systems in perfect working order. 
Looking at the African coastline, and later the interior over Kano, Nigeria, 
Glenn told the tracking station team that he could see a dust storm. Kano flight 
communicators replied that the winds had been quite heavy for the past week.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source37"><SUP>37</A></SUP>
<P>Glenn, completing his spacecraft systems checks over the Canaries, had 
commented that he was getting a little behind in his schedule but that all 
systems still were "go." Then, over Kano, he had commenced his own first major 
yaw adjustment, involving a complete turnaround of the capsule until he was 
facing his flight path. Glenn noted that the attitude indicators disagreed with 
what he could see were true spacecraft attitudes. Despite the incorrect panel 
readouts, he was pleased to be facing the direction his spacecraft was going.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source38"><SUP>38</A></SUP>
<P>Over the Indian Ocean on his first orbit, Glenn became the first American to 
witness the sunset from above 100 miles. Awed but not poetically inclined, the 
astronaut described the moment of twilight simply as "beautiful." Space sky was 
very black, he said, with a thin band of blue along the horizon. He could see 
the cloud strata below, but the clouds in turn prevented his seeing a mortar 
flare fired by the Indian Ocean tracking ship. Glenn described the remarkable 
sunset: [428] the sun went down fast but not quite as quickly as he had 
expected; for five or six minutes there was a slow but continuous reduction in 
light intensity; and brilliant orange and blue layers spread out 45 to 60 
degrees on either side of the sun, tapering gradually toward the horizon.
<P>On the nightside of Earth, nearing the Australian coastline, Glenn made his 
planned star, weather, and landmark observations. He failed to see the dim light 
phenomenon of the heavens called the zodiacal light; he thought his eyes had not 
had sufficient time to adapt to the darkness. Within voice radio range of the 
Muchea, Australia, tracking station, Glenn and Gordon Cooper began a long 
space-to-Earth conversation. The astronaut reported that he felt fine, that he 
had no problems, and that he could see a very bright light and what appeared to 
be the outline of a city. Cooper answered that he probably saw the lights of 
Perth and Rockingham. Glenn also said that he could see stars as he looked down 
toward the "real" horizon - as distinguished from the haze layer he estimated to 
be about seven or eight degrees above the horizon on the nightside - and clouds 
reflecting the moonlight. "That sure was a short day," he excitedly told Cooper. 
"That was about the shortest day I've ever run into."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source39"><SUP>39</A></SUP>
<P>Moving onward above the Pacific over Canton Island, Glenn experienced an even 
shorter 45-minute night and prepared his periscope for viewing his first sunrise 
in orbit. As the day dawned over the island, he saw literally thousands of 
"little specks, brilliant specks, floating around outside the capsule." Glenn's 
first impression was that the spacecraft was tumbling or that he was looking 
into a star field, but a quick hard look out of the capsule window corrected 
this momentary illusion. He definitely thought the luminescent "fireflies," as 
he dubbed the specks, were streaming past his spacecraft from ahead. They seemed 
to flow leisurely but not to be originating from any part of the capsule. As 
<I>Friendship 7</I> sped over the Pacific expanse into brighter sunlight, the 
"fireflies" disappeared.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source40"><SUP>40</A></SUP>
<P>The global circuit was proceeding without any major problems, and Glenn still 
was enjoying his extended encounter with zero g. He ran into some bothersome 
interference on his broadband HF radio when he tried to talk with the Hawaiian 
site at Kauai. An aircraft from the Pacific Missile Range tried unsuccessfully 
to locate the noise source. Other than the mystery of the "fireflies" and the 
intermittent HF interference, the mission was going fine, with the capsule 
attitude control system performing perfectly.
<P>Then the tracking station at Guaymas, Mexico, informed the control center in 
Florida that a yaw reaction jet was giving Glenn an attitude control problem 
that, as he later recalled, "was to stick with me for the rest of the flight." 
This was disheartening news for those in the operations team, who remembered 
that a sticking fuel valve discovered during the second orbital pass of the 
chimpanzee Enos had caused the early termination of MA-5. If Glenn could 
overcome this control problem he would furnish confirmation for Williams' and 
others' contention that man was an essential element in the loop. If the 
psychologists' [429] failure task analyses were correct, the flexibility of man 
should now demonstrate the way to augment the reliability of the machine.
<P>Glenn first noticed the control trouble when the automatic stabilization and 
control system allowed the spacecraft to drift about a degree and a half per 
second to the right, much like an automobile with its front wheels well out of 
alignment. This drift initiated a signal in the system that called for a 
one-pound yaw-left thrust, but there was no rate response. Glenn immediately 
switched to his manual-proportional control mode and eased <I>Friendship 7</I> 
back to orbital attitude. Then, switching from mode to mode, he sought to 
determine how to maintain the correct attitude position with the least cost in 
fuel. He reported that fly-by-wire seemed most effective and economical. Mercury 
Control Center recommended that he stay with this control system. After about 20 
minutes the malfunctioning thruster mysteriously began working again, and with 
the exception of a few weak responses it seemed to be working well by the time 
Glenn was over Texas. After only about a minute of automated flight, however, 
the opposing yaw-right thruster ceased to function. When similar trials and 
waiting did not restore the yaw-right jet, Glenn realized that he would have to 
live with the problem and become a full-time pilot responsible for his own 
well-being.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source41"><SUP>41</A></SUP>
<P>To the operations team at the Cape and to the crews at the tracking sites, 
Glenn appeared to be coping with his attitude control problem well, even though 
he had to omit many of his observational assignments. But a still more serious 
problem bothered the Cape monitors as <I>Friendship 7</I> moved over them. An 
engineer at the telemetry control console, William Saunders, noted that "segment 
51," an instrument providing data on the spacecraft landing system, was 
presenting a strange reading. According to the signal, the spacecraft heatshield 
and the compressed landing bag were no longer locked in position. If this was 
really the case, the all-important heatshield was being held on the capsule only 
by the straps of the retropackage. Almost immediately the Mercury Control Center 
ordered all tracking sites to monitor the instrumentation segment closely and, 
in their conversations with the pilot, to mention that the landing-bag deploy 
switch should be in the "off" position. Although Glenn was not immediately aware 
of his potential danger, he became suspicious when site after site consecutively 
asked him to make sure that the deploy switch was off. Meanwhile the operations 
team had to decide how to get the capsule and the astronaut back through the 
atmosphere with a loose heatshield. After huddling for several minutes, they 
decided that after retrofire the spent retropackage should be retained to keep 
the shield secure during reentry. William M. Bland, Jr., in the control center, 
hurriedly telephoned Maxime A. Faget, the chief designer of the Mercury 
spacecraft, in Houston, to ask if there were any special considerations they 
needed to know or to watch. Faget replied that everything should be all right, 
providing all the retrorockets fired. If they did not, the retropack would have 
to be jettisoned, because any unburned solid propellant would ignite during 
reentry. [430] The operations team concluded that retaining the retropack was 
the only possible way of holding the shield in place and protecting Glenn during 
the early portion of his return to the dense atmosphere. The men in Mercury 
Control realized that the metallic retropack would burn away, but they felt that 
by the time it did, aerodynamic pressures would be strong enough to keep the 
shield in place. The decision once made, the members of the operations team 
fought off a gnawing uneasiness throughout the rest of the flight.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source42"><SUP>42</A></SUP> 
This uneasiness was transmitted to the TV and radio audience before actual 
retrofire.
<P>Meanwhile <I>Friendship 7</I> was vaulting the Atlantic on its second orbital 
pass, and Glenn was busy keeping his capsule's attitude correct and trying to 
accomplish as many of the flight plan tasks as possible. He had advised Virgil 
Grissom at Bermuda that the oculogyric test, involving visually following a 
light spot, had just been completed. Near the Canary Islands the sun, streaming 
through his window, made Glenn a little warm, but he refused to adjust the water 
coolant control on his suit circuit. This time around he observed that evidently 
the "fireflies" outside the spacecraft had no connection with the gas from the 
reaction control jets. Glenn skillfully positioned his ship to take some 
photographs of the cloud masses and Earth spinning past beneath him. As he mused 
over a small bolt floating around inside the capsule, the Kano and Zanzibar 
sites monitoring the capsule suddenly noted a 12 percent drop in the secondary 
oxygen supply.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source43"><SUP>43</A></SUP>
<P>Meanwhile the Indian Ocean tracking ship was preparing for the second pass 
observation experiment. Battened down for heavy weather, the Mercury support 
crew decided that releasing balloons for Glenn to try to see was out of the 
question and instead they fired star-shell parachute flares. Glenn, however, was 
able to observe only lightning flashes in the storm clouds below.
<P>Over the Indian Ocean, Glenn finally decided to adjust the water coolant flow 
in the suit circuit to improve on a condition he described as "comfortably 
warm." By the time he was over Woomera, Australia, the light signal warning of 
excess cabin water told him that the humidity level was rising. From then on 
throughout the rest of the flight he had to balance his suit cooling carefully 
against the cabin humidity, but the temperature inside his suit was never more 
than moderately uncomfortable. Another warning light appeared over Australia, 
indicating that the hydrogen peroxide fuel supply for the automatic system was 
down to 62 percent. Mercury Control Center recommended letting the capsule drift 
in orbit to conserve fuel. Glenn also complained that the roll horizon scanner 
did not seem to be working too well on the nightside of Earth and that it was 
difficult for him to obtain a visual reference to check the situation. To get a 
better view of Earth's horizon he pitched the spacecraft slightly downward, 
which helped some.
<P>For the remainder of the second orbit and while going on into the third pass, 
<I>Friendship 7</I> encountered no new troubles. Glenn continued to control his 
attitude without allowing too much drift, and consequently consumed considerably 
more fuel than the automatic system would have used had the control system been 
working normally. He had used six pounds from the automatic tank and 11.8 pounds 
[431] from the manual on the second orbit, or almost 30 percent of his total 
supply. While he had to pay close attention to the control system to hold the 
fuel expenditure as low as possible, he still had opportunities for making 
observations, photographing the constellation Orion, and executing a third 
180-degree yaw maneuver.
<P>On the last orbital circuit of <I>Friendship 7</I>, the Indian Ocean tracking 
ship gave up on the release of objects for pilot observation; cloud coverage was 
still too thick. There was still time enough for a little joking between Cooper, 
at Muchea, and Glenn. The pilot quite formally requested the "down under" 
communicator to tell General David Shoup, Commandant of the Marine Corps, that 
three orbits should suffice for his minimal monthly requirement of four hours' 
flying time. Glenn asked that he be certified as eligible for his regular flight 
pay increment.
<P>Now that <I>Friendship 7</I> was halfway through its last orbit, Williams and 
Kraft decided to try once more to find out all they could about the heatshield 
before Glenn and his ship plunged through the searing reentry zone. At Kraft's 
order, the Hawaiian tracking site told Glenn to place the landing bag deploy 
switch in the automatic position. Then, if a light came on, he should enter with 
the retropack in place. Coupling this with past queries about this switch, Glenn 
thoroughly deduced his situation. He ran the test, reported that no light 
appeared, and added that he could hear no loose bumping noises when the 
spacecraft's attitude changed. The ground crew leaders differed regarding the 
best possible procedure to follow: Capsule systems monitors in the Control 
Center thought that the retropack should be jettisoned, while the data reduction 
crew urged that it be retained. This left the final decision up to Kraft and 
Williams. They weighed the information they had received and decided it would be 
safer to keep the retropack. Walter Schirra, the California communicator, passed 
the order to Glenn to retain the retropack until he was over the Texas tracking 
station.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source44"><SUP>44</A></SUP>
<P>Meanwhile Glenn was preparing for reentry. Keeping the retrorocket package on 
meant that he had to retract the periscope manually and activate the .05-g 
sequence by pushing the override switch. Then, while nearing the California 
coastline, a little more than four hours and 33 minutes after launch, the 
spacecraft assumed its critical retrofire attitude alignment and the first 
retrorocket fired. "Boy, feels like I'm going halfway back to Hawaii," Glenn 
reported. Seconds later, in orderly succession, the two remaining rockets 
executed the braking process. The attitude controls maintained spacecraft 
position exactly throughout the retrofire sequence; about six minutes after the 
first retrorocket fired, Glenn carefully pitched the conical end of the 
spacecraft up to the correct, 14-degree negative pitch attitude for its downward 
plunge through the atmosphere.
<P>Now came one of the most dramatic and critical moments in all of Project 
Mercury. In the Mercury Control Center, at the tracking stations, and on the 
recovery ships ringing the globe, engineers, technicians, physicians, recovery 
personnel, and fellow astronauts stood nervously, stared at their consoles, and 
listened to the communications circuits. Was the segment 51 reading on the 
landing bag and heatshield correct? [432] If so, would the straps on the 
retropack keep the heatshield in place long enough during reentry? And even if 
they did, was the thermal protection designed and developed into the Mercury 
spacecraft truly adequate? Would this, America's first manned orbital flight, 
end in the incineration of the astronaut? The whole Mercury team felt itself on 
trial and awaited its verdict.
<P>Glenn and <I>Friendship 7</I> slowed down during their long reentry glide 
over the continental United States toward the hoped-for splashdown in the 
Atlantic. The Corpus Christi station told Glenn to retain the retropack until 
the g meter before him read 1.5. Busily involved with his control problems, 
Glenn reported over the Cape that he had been handling the capsule manually and 
would use the fly-by–wire control mode as a backup. Mercury Control then gave 
him the .05-g mark, and the pilot punched the override button, saying later that 
he seemed to be in the fringes of the g field before he pushed. Almost 
immediately Glenn heard noises that sounded like "small things brushing against 
the capsule." "That's a real fireball outside," he radioed the Cape, with a 
trace of anxiety perhaps evident in his tone. Then a strap from the retropackage 
swung around and fluttered over the window, and he saw smoke as the whole 
apparatus was consumed. Although his control system seemed to be holding well, 
his manual fuel supply was down to 15 percent, with the deceleration peak still 
to come. So he switched to fly-by-wire and the automatic tank supply.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source45"><SUP>45</A></SUP>
<P><I>Friendship 7</I> came now to the most fearful and fateful point of its 
voyage. The terrific frictional heat of reentry enveloped the capsule, and Glenn 
experienced his worst emotional stress of the flight. "I thought the retropack 
had jettisoned and saw chunks coming off and flying by the window," he said 
later. He feared that the chunks were pieces of his ablation protection, that 
the heatshield might be disintegrating, but he knew there was nothing to gain 
from stopping work.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm#source46"><SUP>46</A></SUP>
<P>Shortly after passing the peak g region, the spacecraft began oscillating so 
severely that Glenn could not control the ship manually. <I>Friendship 7</I> 
swung far past the "tolerable" 10 degrees on both sides of the zero-degree 
point. "I felt like a falling leaf," Glenn would recall. So he cut in the 
auxiliary damping system, which helped to stabilize the large yaw and roll rates 
to a more comfortable level. Fuel in the automatic tanks, however, was getting 
low. Obviously the heatshield had stayed in place; Glenn was still alive. But 
now he wondered whether his capsule would remain stable down to an altitude at 
which the drogue parachute could be deployed safely.
<P>The pilot's fears proved real when both fuel supplies ran dry. Automatic fuel 
gave out at 111 seconds, and manual fuel depleted at 51 seconds, before the 
drogue deployment. The oscillations rapidly resumed, and at about 35,000 feet 
Glenn decided he had better try to deploy the drogue manually lest the 
spacecraft flip over into an antenna-downward instead of a heatshield-downward 
position. But just as he lifted his hand toward the switch, the drogue 
automatically shot out at 28,000 feet instead of the nominal 21,000. Suddenly 
the spacecraft straightened out and, as Glenn reported, "everything was in good 
shape."<A

<P>[433] All systems in <I>Friendship 7</I> worked with precision for the 
remainder of the flight. At about 17,000 feet the periscope opened again for the 
pilot's use. Glenn, instead, glanced out the window, but it was coated with so 
much smoke and film that he could see very little. The spacecraft stabilized in 
its descent; the antenna section jettisoned; and Glenn, with immense relief, 
watched the main chute stream out, reef, and blossom. The Florida control center 
reminded Glenn to deploy the landing bag. He flipped the switch, saw the green 
light confirmation, and felt a comforting "clunk" as the shield and impact bag 
dropped into position four feet below the capsule. Glenn watched the ocean 
coming up to meet him and braced as the gap closed. Jolted by an impact that was 
more reassuring than stunning, he bobbed in the water, checked his watertight 
integrity, and relayed his elation that a successful MA-6 mission seemed 
assured.<A

<P><I>Friendship 7</I> had splashed into the Atlantic about 40 miles short of 
the predicted area, as retrofire calculations had not taken into account the 
spacecraft's weight loss in consumables. The <I>Noa</I>, a destroyer code-named 
Steelhead, had spotted the spacecraft during its descent. From a distance of 
about six miles the destroyer radioed Glenn that it could reach him shortly. 
Seventeen minutes later, the <I>Noa</I> cruised alongside; a sailor smartly 
cleared the spacecraft antenna; and Boatswain's Mate David Bell deftly attached 
a davit line for pickup. During the hoist upward the spacecraft bumped solidly 
against the side of the destroyer. Once <I>Friendship 7</I> was lowered to the 
mattress pallet, Glenn began removing paneling, intending to leave the capsule 
through the upper hatch. But it was too hot, and the operation was too slow for 
the already long day. So he told the ship's crew to stand clear, carefully 
removed the hatch detonator, and hit the plunger with the back of his hand. The 
plunger recoiled, cutting Glenn's knuckles slightly through his glove and giving 
him the only injury he received during the whole mission. A loud report 
indicated that the hatch was off. Eager hands pulled out the smiling astronaut, 
whose first words were "It was hot in there."
<P>Lieutenant Commander Robert Mulin of the Navy and Captain Gene McIver of the 
Army, physicians assigned to the Mercury recovery team, described Glenn as being 
hot, sweating profusely, and fatigued. He was lucid but not loquacious, thirsty 
but not hungry. After drinking a glass of water and showering, he became more 
talkative. Asked if he felt any "stomach uneasiness" either during the flight or 
while he lolled the 17 minutes in the floating spacecraft waiting for pickup, 
Glenn admitted only to some "stomach awareness," beginning after he was down on 
the water. But there was no nausea, and the examining physicians assured 
themselves that Glenn's condition was caused by heat, humidity, and some 
dehydration. He had lost five pounds, five ounces from his preflight weight of 
171 pounds, seven ounces. He had consumed the equivalent of only 94 cubic 
centimeters of water, in the form of applesauce puree, during the flight, while 
his urine output was 800 cubic centimeters. He also had perspired profusely 
while awaiting pickup.
<P>Glenn's temperature an hour after landing was 99.2 degrees, or only a degree 
[434] higher than his preflight reading, and by midnight he recorded a normal 
temperature. His blood pressure registered only a fraction higher than the 
preflight readings. The condition of his heart and lungs was normal before and 
after the mission, and there was nothing unusual about his skin except the 
superficial abrasions on the knuckles, caused by opening the hatch. By the time 
President Kennedy called his personal congratulations by radio telephone to 
Glenn aboard the <I>Noa</I>, the "wonderful trip–almost unbelievable" was over, 
Glenn was safe and sound, and 100 million American television viewers had 
happily ceased their vigil.
<P>After recording on tape a "self-debriefing" aboard the <I>Noa</I>, Glenn was 
transferred to the carrier <I>Randolph</I>, where his chest was x-rayed, an 
electrocardiogram was made, and the initial phase of the technical debriefing 
was started. From there the astronaut was transported to Grand Turk Island, 
where a much more thorough physical began about 9:30 p.m., under the direction 
of Carmault B. Jackson, assistant to Flight Surgeon Douglas. February 20, 1962, 
proved to be "a long day at the office" for Glenn. After exhaustive tests and 
observations the attending physicians could find no adverse effects from Glenn's 
threefold circumnavigation in space. Technical debriefings continued for two 
days on the island and then moved to the Cape for another day's session.
<P>The postflight analysis of Glenn's use of the three-axis handcontroller 
during reentry showed that about half of the thrust pulses he initiated opposed 
the direction of spacecraft motion, as they were supposed to. But the other half 
of the handcontroller movements either reinforced oscillating motions or had no 
net damping effect. The issue of "pilot-induced error" was picked up by some 
newsmen and reported as a controversy rather than a problem.
<P>Now that the primary objectives of Project Mercury had been achieved at last 
in grand style, the drive for perfection in performance, so indispensable to 
manned space flight, still did not slow down.<A

for MA—6." The General Electric–Burroughs booster-guidance system performed an 
interesting operation. Aboard the Atlas were three small black boxes, two of 
them similar to two-way radios. A radar on the ground automatically tracked 
signals emanating from these boxes, determining range and position. The 
operation for the MA - 6 mission progressed along the following pattern: A few 
minutes before launch time Michael Michela, the GE rate console operator, 
flipped a switch that pointed the rate antennas in the same directions as the 
precise tracking radar. This was to obtain velocity data. Thomas Waid, the track 
console operator, pushed a button to place the guidance system in automatic 
operation. Guidance system signals were aimed on a "cube in space" several 
hundred feet above the booster. It was simply a matter of waiting until the 
booster passed through this area, when the signals locked onto a radio 
transponder and the system began steering the launch vehicle after staging. This 
condition was maintained until orbital conditions were attained. The system had 
operated some 8000 hours before MA-6, and some members of the guidance team, 
consisting of Rodney Borum, John Savarie, Donald Wood, Waid, Robert Stanton, and 
Michela, had participated in as many as 121 launches. (News release, "Radio 
Guidance Functions of Mercury-Atlas 6," Defense Electronics Div., General 
Electric Co., undated; News release, no title, Defense Electronics Div., General 
Electric Co., undated.) During the powered phase of the flight, Kraft was 
notified that signals from a foreign C-band radar transmitter had been 
intercepted, but the operations team was unable to identify the source.

but felt as though he were tumbling. Shepard and Grissom reported the same 
sensation. The apogee of Glenn's flight was 162 miles; the perigee, 100 miles.

applesauce without difficulty. (<I>Results of the First United States Manned

with his exerciser, and the tracking station noted a temporary increase in his 
pulse rate to 140.

disagreements were inherent and would crop up whenever major yaw or roll 
attitudes deviated from zero degrees for an extended period of time. In other 
words, the gyro "readouts" on the panel, which were reporting an attitude change 
of about four degrees per minute, were considerably behind Glenn's quickly 
slewing yaw maneuver. Consequently the best procedure when executing such an 
operation was to stop the revolving gyroscopes, an action called "caging."

later, Glenn remarked facetiously that he had half-expected the mayor to hand 
him an electric bill. An attempt to observe the airport lights at Woomera had 
failed because of cloudiness. As for the height of the haze layer, Jocelyn R. 
Gill of NASA Headquarters said this distance was later measured and found to be 
about 2 1/2 degrees above the horizon. For other comments on Glenn's

On Feb. 26, 1962, postflight inspectors disassembled the thrust chamber systems 
and found some loose particles upstream of the fuel-metering orifices. These 
were found to be pieces of the dutch-weave fuel-distribution screens. Fuel 
consumption during the first orbit was 4.2 pounds from the automatic tanks and 
.6 pound from the manual tanks. Those figures were nominal; control trouble did 
not develop until the flight had been in progress for an hour and 29 minutes.

At the moment of Glenn's splashdown, the Post Office issued a special 4-cent 
stamp commemorating the MA-6 mission ("Transcript of Announcements by John

he wished he had known of the supposed heatshield and landing bag problem, so 
that he could have been listening for sound clues. He seemed to be making the 
point that the pilot, as the thinking part of the man-machine team, should be 
allowed to participate in decision making. Scott Crossfield, one of the X-15 
pilots, expressed this view well in the immediate post-MA-6 period: "Where else 
would you get a non-linear computer weighing only 160 pounds, having a billion 
binary decision elements, that can be mass-produced by unskilled labor?"
