<H1>Brickbat Priority</H1>From the beginning STG had sought to obtain the 
Nation's highest priority for the manned satellite program. But the White House, 
Congress, and NASA Headquarters at first regarded as equally important the 
development of a "10<SUP>6</SUP>," [135] or one-million-pound-thrust, booster 
engine, and the elaboration of space sciences through the continuation of 
instrumented satellite programs similar to Vanguard. Hugh L. Dryden initiated a 
request to the Department of Defense as early as November 14, 1958, to put the 
"manned satellite and the one-million-pound-thrust engine" in the DOD Master 
Urgency List alongside the Minuteman and Polaris weapon systems. But the 
National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC) had deferred this request on 
December 3, pending a scheduled meeting the next week of the Civilian-Military 
Liaison Committee (CMLC). The Space Council did recommend that NASA assign its 
highest in-house priority to Project Mercury. When it met, the Liaison Committee 
recommended the "DX," or highest industrial procurement priority, for the manned 
satellite. They assumed that the Vanguard and Jupiter-C projects would be 
dropped from that category and that the mullion-pound-thrust engine would be 
assigned the next lower, or a "DO," priority.<A

<P>New additions to the DX list required the approval of the National Security 
Council, but earlier that body had delegated authority to the Secretary of 
Defense to decide on top priorities for satellite systems. Secretary Neil H. 
McElroy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff received the Liaison Committee's 
recommendations for a new Master Urgency List on December 17. NASA Administrator 
T. Keith Glennan protested to William M. Holaday, the Pentagon's Director of 
Guided Missiles and chairman of the Liaison Committee, that not only Mercury but 
the big new booster, to become known in February as the Saturn, should have top 
priority. McElroy therefore directed Holaday to review the entire DX category 
before deciding what to do about the dual NASA requests for the so-called 
"brickbat," or highest, priority rating.<A

Here matters stood at the end of the year.
<P>For these reasons, financial allowances for extensive (and expensive) 
overtime work and the authorization for preferential acquisition of scarce 
materials were delayed well into 1959. Maxime A. Faget's optimistic belief 
before the program started that a man might possibly be placed in orbit within 
18 months, or during the second quarter of the calendar year 1960, depended upon 
the immediate assignment of the Nation's highest priority to Mercury - and an 
enormous amount of the best possible luck! One of the first official estimates 
of the launch schedule for STG, made by Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., in early 
December for the Air Force Missile Test Center at Cape Canaveral predicted 
concurrent development, qualification, and manned orbital flights from April 
through September in 1960.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-2.htm#source5"><SUP>5</A></SUP> 
This "guesstimate" was likewise predicated on an immediate Defense Department 
order to allow Project Mercury to compete "on a non-interference basis" with the 
military missile programs in obtaining critical "off-the-shelf" components, 
particularly electronic and guidance items.
<P>By the first of the new year, it was fairly clear that the large Saturn 
booster would be continued by the Army's Wernher von Braun team and that the 
Defense Department was not about to release von Braun and his associates to 
NASA. Glennan, Dryden, and Silverstein had given Project Mercury the highest 
priority [136] within NASA itself, but among industrial suppliers and the 
Defense Department it ranked second to several more urgent and competing 
demands. By March 1959, definite evidence of equipment and material supply 
shortages accumulated. The new prime contractor warned of delivery schedule 
slippages resulting from Mercury's DO rating. Holaday's reports were favorable 
toward Mercury, and Glennan compromised on the "10<SUP>6</SUP>-engines." For the 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) had directed the Army Ordnance Missile 
Command and the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, respectively, to start 
independent development of both a clustered first-stage booster (the Saturn) and 
a single-chamber rocket engine (the F-1) able to generate about 1,500,000 pounds 
of thrust.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-2.htm#source6"><SUP>6</A></SUP>
<P>So NASA finally presented a united front with the Defense Department to the 
President and Congressional committees. On April 27, 1959, Eisenhower himself 
approved the request for the "brickbat" procurement rating for Mercury. The 
prime contract and most of the major subcontracts for the space capsule had been 
let well before May 4, when Mercury was officially listed in the topmost 
category on the Master Urgency List.<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-2.htm#source7"><SUP>7</A></SUP> 
But the attendant privilege of not having to seek the lowest bidder on every 
major item bought was probably less important to the development of the program 
than the added prestige and support the DX rating brought to Mercury within the 
aerospace industry and among the military services.
<P>During the first quarter of 1959, confusion reigned in Washington aerospace 
circles as too many missile czars, too many space projects, and too many 
agencies clamored for more funds and support. But journalists, scientists, and 
humanitarians applauded the successes of the Navy-NASA <I>Vanguard II,</I> a 
tiny weather satellite; of the Air Force's <I>Discoverer I,</I> first satellite 
in polar orbit; and of the Army-NASA <I>Pioneer IV,</I> which managed to 
duplicate <I>Mechta's</I> escape velocity. As a deep-space probe and the first 
U.S. solar satellite, <I>Pioneer IV,</I> launched March 3, was magnificently 
instrumental in expanding man's knowledge of the plurality of the Van Allen 
radiation belts and of the "solar winds," or radiation storms, that permeate 
interplanetary space. Glennan had resolved to identify all NASA booster rockets 
with the name "United States" only, but other rocket agencies within the 
government were unlikely to follow suit. In the midst of all this, Project 
Mercury seemed still an obscure conception to the public. Roy W. Johnson of ARPA 
called it "very screwball" when first proposed; by the end of March he said, "It 
looks a little less screwball now."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-2.htm#source8"><SUP>8</A></SUP>
<P>Meanwhile, within STG itself, the most urgent task in getting on with the 
program had already been accomplished by the end of 1958. On December 29 the 
Task Group had completed its technical assessments of the industrial proposals 
for manufacturing the capsule and its subsystems. Eleven complete proposals had 
been received. The narrowing of the field of possible manufacturers was 
facilitated by the fact that so many alternate configurations were submitted. 
Faget had invited the bidders "to submit alternate capsule and configuration 
designs if you so desire, provided that you incorporate the retrorocket 
principle, [137] the non-lifting principle and the non-ablating heat sink 
principle. You are not limited to this particular approach only."<A 
href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch6-2.htm#source9"><SUP>9</A></SUP> 
But some of the bidders had taken him altogether too literally in this 
statement.
