<H1>Mercury Mission Accomplished</H1>[411] Prospects looked bright to the 
managers of Project Mercury at the beginning of 1962. In store was Mercury-Atlas 
6, scheduled as a manned orbital flight and viewed by some as a salvage 
operation for America's space prestige. If one of its citizens, Marine pilot 
John Glenn, journeyed successfully through space on a multi-orbit global 
mission, the United States would at least begin matching the pace set by the 
Soviet Union. Although a 3-orbit trek would by no means equal the 17-orbit, 
day-long voyage of Gherman S. Titov, the imminence of the mission had helped to 
allay national uneasiness somewhat. The notion that the manned orbital launch 
should be made in 1961 to coincide with Russian feats in the history books 
subsided with the end of the old year; 1962 was now here. Whatever regrets the 
American people had harbored over the numerous delays in Project Mercury, they 
seemed reconciled to schedule slippages if safety demanded them.
<P>But the new year was barely three days old when the news media learned that 
the announced launch date of January 16 had been postponed until January 23, at 
the earliest, because of technical problems in the booster fuel tanks. With each 
succeeding delay, and there would be several more, journalists and Congressmen 
became a little more critical and fidgety. Once again, as on several previous 
occasions, the press spoke of the "space gap," and doubts were raised by some 
writers that the Mercury undertaking would ever succeed. A senior member of the 
House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Republican James G. Fulton of 
Pennsylvania, apparently subscribed to this feeling when he remarked, after 
viewing a January 27 MA-6 launch attempt, that the Mercury spacecraft and Atlas 
booster could be described as "a Rube Goldberg device on top of a plumber's 
nightmare." President Kennedy disclosed at a news conference on February 14 that 
he too shared the general disappointment voiced about delays in the program, but 
he added that the decision to go or not to go should be left to the "group who 
are making the judgment." Moreover, he reaffirmed his faith in the NASA Mercury 
team: "I'm going to follow their judgment, even though we've had bad luck."<A

<P>[412] Statements issued by the Manned Spacecraft Center's operations team 
after each postponement of the MA-6 mission were terse and technical, and their 
frankness in reporting the reasons for these delays prompted some favorable news 
comment. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> commended NASA for its open information 
policy, and pointed out that anything but "Candor at Canaveral" could only hurt 
the "national image." In response to their persistent and sometimes annoying 
questions, reporters were quietly told that this mission had been in the 
planning processes for almost three years and that a few more days' or weeks' 
delay was of little consequence if confidence in its success could be raised 
another notch. This acceptance of the situation by the Cape launch crew and 
operations team stemmed from the program's composite flight test experience. 
John Glenn, knowing all of this, enjoined the press representatives covering the 
event not to worry:<A

<BLOCKQUOTE>This mission has been in preparation for a long time. I can't get 
  particularly shook up about a couple of days' delay. As a matter of fact, I'm 
  so happy to have been chosen to be the pilot for this mission that I'm not 
  about to get panicky over these delays. I learned very early in the 
  flight-test business that you have to control your emotions - you don't let 
  these things throw you or affect your ability to perform the 
mission.</BLOCKQUOTE>The Mercury team alone knew what had to be right to make it 
go. 
<P>Back in October 1959, the MA-6 flight, possibly carrying a chimpanzee in 
spacecraft No. 18, had been scheduled for launch in January 1961. But the 
fortunes or misfortunes of manufacture and the ensuing flight test program 
forced many schedule slippages, redesignation of flight order, and capsule 
configuration changes to meet altered test objectives. According to an April 
1960 chart, the first manned orbital attempt (originally MA-7) was slated for a 
May 1961 launch. Six months later the planners moved the target date for this 
mission to July, and after a similar interval they foresaw October as the likely 
launch date. NASA Headquarters' approval of the proposal to add one-day missions 
to the Mercury flight series required further schedule alterations. Several 
spacecraft had to be modified for the flights of longer duration. Spacecraft No. 
13 was allocated to the MA-6 mission, replacing No. 18, which now was entered 
into the modification cycle. In spite of all this shuffling, as late as October 
1961 the program managers held hopefully to an anticipated manned orbital 
liftoff within 1961. MA-6, instead of MA-7, the managers indicated, would carry 
the first astronaut into orbit, providing the MA-5 chimpanzee flight succeeded 
in November.<A

<P>A host of manufacturing changes had delayed the progress of spacecraft No. 13 
as it traveled through the McDonnell production and checkout line. Number 13, 
beginning to take form in May 1960, also met with the usual fabrication problems 
its predecessors had faced during assembly. On October 10, for example, 
McDonnell reported to the Space Task Group that a shortage of environmental 
control system components had completely halted work on the capsule's interior. 
[413] At the end of January 1961, however, the company had started a three-month 
test shakedown of the vehicle. Shortly after the completion of this work the 
failure of the MA-3 mission on April 25 had forced a rearrangement of spacecraft 
allocations, and McDonnell had been told by the NASA planners to redesign No. 13 
for the initial manned orbital mission. The factory finished and delivered the 
spacecraft to the Cape on August 27. Four months later, after a thorough 
checkout by the Manned Spacecraft Center's (formerly Space Task Group) Cape 
team, on January 2, 1962, it was mated to its launch vehicle, Atlas 109-D.<A

<P>These had been some of the trials that made planning and scheduling difficult 
occupations, especially in a program that had been so often under national 
scrutiny. Therefore, the successive MA-6 launching delays logged in the early 
days of 1962 simply were noted and accepted, and the planners met to decide when 
they could be ready to try again.

chimpanzee mission, designated MA-6, would have been flown.
